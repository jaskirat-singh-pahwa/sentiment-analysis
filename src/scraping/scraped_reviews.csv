"The Avengers","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0848228/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt/","7"," The world loves it, though I still think the original "Iron Man", "Thor" and "Captain America" were my favorites. ","At this point, "The Avengers" has made around 100 trillion dollars (or so)--and so it's obvious that people love the film. My own daughter went to the premier in New York and then went to it on opening night in general release--and was mad I didn't take her with me tonight to see it! Obviously, she loved the film as well. As for me, I liked it but didn't quite share the overall exuberance for the film. Mind you, I liked it--but I think I preferred the earlier films before the Avengers team was formed. There was a certain charm that I didn't quite see recaptured in the film. Now the film is good--it's just that what I like in these other films I would have liked more of in "The Avengers". Specifically, the movie could have used a bit more humor and a bit more character development. When I read the IMDb trivia, it seems that originally the film had about 30 more minutes--all showing Steve Rogers (Captain America) trying to adjust to his new life. I would have LOVED seeing all this--and less of the HUGE battle at the end of the film. For me, it just felt numbing after a while and I would have liked more of the characters when they weren't fighting. Again, however, I DID like the film....but the earlier Marvel/Disney films I liked just a bit better. Just my two cents worth..."
"The Avengers","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0848228/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt/","9"," Not 100% perfect but still an outstanding film in so many ways ","Superhero films are always fun to watch when they are done right, and while to some degree it is understandable why people wouldn't be totally enamoured with it(as seen in a lot of the negative comments, a lot of them being condescending though- enough with the ignorant conspiracy theories already!- and some not even worthy of being called reviews) Avengers Assemble for me was an example of a fun and intelligent superhero film that was done right. True, the story is formulaic but not to the extent that was too distracting. In fact my only two complaint was to do with one performances that didn't quite work personally. And that was Jeremy Renner who was rather on the dull side as Hawkeye, whose character development did seem a little rushed and underwritten, that Hawkeye has inner demons is made very clear but it could have come through more strongly. However the rest of the performances were great, a big shout out going to Tom Hiddleston who is serpentine personified as Loki, though Robert Downey Jnr's charismatic Iron Man, Samuel L. Jackson's no-nonsense Nick Fury, Mark Ruffalo's very confident Hulk(he doesn't make you miss Eric Bana or Ed Norton), Chris Hemsworth's dynamic and not wimpy Thor(if he was I put it down to his hidden demons character development) and Chris Evans' modest, heartfelt Captain America were equally great. Scarlett Johansson convinces mostly too, Black Widow's back story is intriguing and Johansson is wonderful when she acts fearless but when in her emotional, imploring moments her acting is rather forced and out of character for Black Widow. For a film with as many characters as seen here, Avengers Assemble still makes a vast majority of them very interesting(only Hawkeye really disappointed), in character and not one-sided and all of them have their turn to shine. It didn't feel to me like a film that tried to cram in too many heroes all at once for the sake of it. The film is very slickly made with astounding special effects and dazzlingly executed stunt-work. Alan Silvestri's score pulsates with power and the action sequences are exciting. The story may be formulaic and standard good-and-evil but is crisply paced and intelligently handled with just the right blend of humour, pathos and action with not one component over-shadowing the others. What was really enjoyable especially was the toe-to-toe with Thor and Iron Man and Hulk. What was really remarkable was the script, filled with thoughtful exposition and snappy banter that stayed true to The Avengers while also with Joss Whedon's own style that was apparent in a lot of his other work. Overall, Avengers Assemble may not be 100% perfect or among the best ever but it is still an outstanding film with a lot to love about it, and no this is not coming from a fake account or a plant, just someone who can be hard to please who genuinely enjoyed it. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
"The Avengers","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0848228/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt/","8",A Gem of an Action Movie ","The Avengers (2012) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Nick Fury brings together Iron Man, the Incredible Hulk, Captain America, Hawkeye and Black Widow to join forces and do battle against an enemy that threatens global security in this rather amazing comic book adaptation. I'll be honest and admit that comic book movies aren't my #1 type of film and it wasn't until just a month before THE AVENGERS opened that I bothered to check out the casts supporting movies. I enjoyed the two IRON MAN movies, thought THOR was very good, THE INCREDIBLE HULK was entertaining and I found CAPTAIN America to be decent but no matter what I felt about those films it couldn't prepare me for how much I enjoyed this one. Director Joss Whedon has created something incredibly special and you really can't help but think he's raised the super hero bar so high that many future films are going to have problems reaching it. When bringing all of these characters together, the filmmakers could have taken an easy route and just give us mindless action but that wasn't the case here as Whedon really delivered a deep but easy to follow story and he knew how to have fun with it. The constant banter between the superheroes could have led to some very unfunny moments but the screenplay was so smart in allowing each of their personalities to come through and then added the fun of taking those personalities and throw them at one another. This banter really turned into something incredibly funny and allowed for some great one-liners as well as some terrific action. When it comes to these type of movies I usually complain about a couple things. One is the obvious CGI but that wasn't a problem here because it just looked so realistic that it never took you out of the story and instead it put you more directly into it. Another thing I usually complain about in recent mainstream movies are the expanded running times. THE AVENGERS clocks in at 142-minutes, which made me nervous going in but it turns out that this film proves long running times are okay as long as you have enough to support it and this movie does. In fact, the long running time felt extremely short as the film flies by without any problems. Say what you will about comic adaptations but there's no question that THE AVENGERS is first rate entertainment thanks in large part to the great direction, the detailed writing and each of the performers fitting their roles and bringing them to life. This here is without question a complete success so future comic movie makers had better step their game up."
"The Avengers","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0848228/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt/","8","Wanted to hate it, ended up loving it ","I'm not really a comic book fan, so after hearing the constant hype about this film for a couple of years I really wasn't too fussed when it finally appeared on TV. I went into it expecting not to like it much, and indeed the first hour seemed to me middling at best: some mildly lame comedy, a whole lot of posturing, and a silly storyline involving silly characters.Then things changed. They started to pick up, and the action started hitting home. Then all hell broke loose with a climax that felt like it lasted a whole hour, an hour packed with kaiju-style mayhem as New York found itself subjected to an alien invasion. And I was wowed. Never before has it been possible to depict such constant, wide-scale mayhem, but with the improvement of CGI technology it's finally up there on screen with all of its glory.And yes, I ended up liking MARVEL'S AVENGERS ASSEMBLE. What's not to like, really? The whole feel is kept light and there are so many larger-than-life characters that you end up having a ball with it regardless. Mark Ruffalo's Hulk is my favourite character by far - Ruffalo is far better suited to the role than Eric Bana or Edward Norton - but Chris Evans's Captain America comes a close second. Sure, I see this film for what it is: a mindless piece of crowd-pleasing, overblown CGI mayhem, replete with a silly, buffoonish bad guy - but at the same time I can't help but getting caught up for the ride."
"The Avengers","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0848228/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt/","9"," Avengers vs TDKR ","Nick Fury brings together Earth's mightiest heroes to stop Loki who is unleashing an alien invasion.Robert Downey Jr. makes this good and Joss Whedon makes this great. Downey has already shown that he's a movie star. He could power a whole franchise all by himself but the Avengers is more than just a one man team. This is a quintessential Joss Whedon Scooby gang, and he's great at the snappy dialog and friend-hate comradry. This is a whole team of heroes working together.Because of its timing, this will be compared to The Dark Knight Rises. Most seems to give TDKR more credit because of its darker grittier tone. Both are great but I like Avengers better. Honestly, TDKR is inferior to TDK. There are logic problems with TDKR. There are too many comic-book moves in that film. It's melodramatic in its emotionally manipulations. The Avengers is simply better written. Its dialog is better. It may be simplistic but it's more fun."
"The Avengers","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0848228/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt/","8"," I'm Too Old for This! ","I'm swearing off super-hero movies. I've become abundantly aware that there are legions of fans out there who can't wait to see what Hollywood is doing with the classic comic book characters. But after three Iron Men and now this, I see a sameness in them all, and I'm not equipped properly to enjoy them as I should. I'm still rating this pretty high because it is amazing to look at, the special effects are beyond belief, and some of the characters have some dimension. That said, I think I would need a manual to really get the true impact of each character, what his or her powers are, and how they fit together. There is always some evildoing bad guy who has some history with the others. This is what makes comics what they are (I read lots of comics as a kid, so I do understand the milieu). When you get right down to it, however, they seem to rely mostly on beating each other over the head with whatever is handy. It's like watching professional wrestling which is sort of comic bookish in its own way. It's a cast of characters what represent simple things, both good and evil. I'll leave these to the kids and continue to watch movies with complex characters and clever story lines."
"The Avengers","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0848228/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt/","7"," New York Geography ","To love movies is to enjoy good movies, no matter how you define them. If there are good movies, there are bad movies. While some people claim to hate CGI, there are those of us who consider it another tool to make a movie, but think it can be misused.I like a lot of superhero movies. I have been enjoying most of the Marvel Studio movies, but some are better than others. It turns out I like the big fight sequence in the first Avengers movie because it clearly takes place around Grand Central. I can relate to it, since I am a native New Yorker. I take pleasure in seeing how the Helmsley Palace tunnels are used, and the Pershing Overpass. The Spiderman movie with the elevated train along Canal Street annoyed me.There are lots of movies that use "movie geography" that makes no sense and they don't all use CGI. There was a Michael Keaton vehicle about twenty years ago called THE HARD WAY which annoyed me with its nonsensical geography. The problem is not CGI; It's using CGI or other techniques to enable bad scripts."
"The Avengers","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0848228/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt/","6"," A success yes, but not really on a groundbreaking level ","Here we have "The Avengers", the five-year-old movie from 2012 that was really breaking all box office records back 5 years ago. The director and co-writer was Joss Whedon, at that point mostly known for Buffy and Toy Story, the film that brought him an Oscar nomination. But now, this one here is certainly his career-defining work. The era of superhero blockbuster films had already started back then and RDJ's Iron Man franchise was going well enough for using his popularity to bring up a Marvel superhero all-stars film. Thor and Captain America of course have their own films now too. But back to this one here. Hiddleston was still doing a good job and Loki as a villain definitely does not get old too quickly. Some great potential this character has. Not a surprise at all, Whedon was also going for comedy next to the fantasy, drama and action sequences. Most of it was working out well like the restaurant scene at the very end. The only parts I did not like from the comedy perspective were probably the Tony Stark one-liner moments, but that's also subjective.This film was nominated for its special effects for a BAFTA and an Oscar and lost both times to Life of Pi. Of course, fitting the box office success, it received many other honors during the award season back then. At slightly over 140 minutes, it is a really long watch indeed and I think there were enough insignificant moments to stay under the 2-hour-mark. But I still take it as it is as there wasn't a great deal of dragging which is certainly a success for its duration. Back to the villain, Loki may have been the primary antagonist here, but there is a lot more conflict in here, most of all the Avengers managing to grow into a team that manages to hold their egos back a bit for the greater cause. It's a long way to that. And when it's finally done, Loki reappears by opening the gates to hell or the gates to the "other end of the universe" as they were saying. So what was the best thing here? Yes it may be the special effects work indeed as they helped the film nicely to overcome a few lengths. And I am not talking about the spectacular stuff like the explosions here, but also for example about the more subtle effects like what Iron Man sees written in his mask.So yeah, overall I think this was a good watch. Everybody will have their favorites from the cast, but as the film is so long, every bigger character gets his solid deal of screen time. For me, these would be Jackson, Renner and ScarJo of course, even if I must admit that SLJ's character did not do a whole lot for me in here. It's a film you want to watch when you are in for some pointless fun. It's of course not a realistic movie at all from start to finish, but it's still a success and not just in quality, but also definitely from the commercial perspective. No surprise number 3 is coming out soon. Still the IMDb and RT ratings may be a bit too high to be honest. Nonetheless, if you are not one of the million people who have seen and rated this blockbuster here on IMDb, it really is high time to finally go check it out. Today was the second (or third) time I watched it and I think it does not lose any of its appeal on rewatch. Go for it, especially if you like Marvel films. I give this first (new) Avengers film a thumbs-up. The character are really interesting and fun to watch, not just during their introduction in the first 45 minutes."

They released their second tier superheroes (Thor, Captain America) to great acclaim and it all lead up to The Avengers film where the characters of the Marvel cinema universe converged.Iron Man as portrayed by Robert Downey jr is the main man with his witty one liners and conflicting with the more straight up Captain America. There is a lot of substance with Mark Ruffalo's Dr Banner keeping his alter ego monster at bay.Joss Whedon as co writer and director balances action, adventure and laughs.Each of the character gets his time in the sun, Loki is the malevolent presence.No wonder the film was a behemoth at the box office."

The special effects are state-of-art and instead of writing a long review, I suggest the reader to watch this highly entertaining movie. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): "Os Vingadores" ("The Avengers")"
"The Avengers","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0848228/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt/","8",Consistently enjoyable effects and noise with the right amount of fun mixed in ","You could be forgiven for approaching this film with trepidation for many reasons. The most obvious is that it is a big superhero summer blockbuster film a type of film that is popular but all too often disappointing (indeed an accusation that could be levelled at films featuring characters in this film). Secondly though, a common problem with all the various character films leading up to this joint effort is that they generally struggled to make all the characters fit and you had the constant feeling that all the positioning and introductions were hurting the individual tales just for the sake of this joint one; so I did wonder how it was going to cope with all these characters running around in one place.Ironically enough though, the character balancing turns out to not be a massive problem in this case and I think it is partly because they do all exist as equals within the same plot lines, rather than being forced onto others. The plot is suitably overblown and involves an intergalactic threat rather than a man-made one; again this concerned me at first because I didn't particularly care for Thor and I did get the feeling that this would be more of the same, with gods and mythical creatures running around. To a point this was the case here because to the casual viewer (which I am), these aliens aren't really known or understood but the film does make it work because it allows it to be just about serious enough to avoid spoof but at the same time generating sufficient fun so that you go along with it. In some ways it is the polar opposite of the other big superhero franchise out this summer (Batman) because where one aims for darkness and introspection, Avengers really has no interest and instead focuses on delivering fun and action in an easily accessible and enjoyable package.And this it does. Across all the characters we have good humour and banter which never undermines the action but rather adds to it, giving it a sense of fun that engages and helpfully prevents you questioning the detail too much or having things like specific comic banter stand out against the serious nature of the action. There are lots of nice comic touches and lines but for me Hulk randomly punching Thor was the high point (with the "puny god" moment being a very close second). The cast go with it and I liked that everyone did work together without any one specific character hogging too much of the screen. Downey Jr is fun as normal and he works well with Evans, who I thought was better here than he was in his own film. Likewise Hemsworth benefits from a bit of decent humour and fun (two things lacking in his own film) and Ruffalo makes for a good Hulk, again though he is helped by the lack of having to carry a whole film. Johansson and Renner are good in support and the rest of the cast features good turns from many familiar faces, none of whom get in the way but all contribute to the fun.It is easy to turn your nose up at Avengers because it is basically an effects-driven summer blockbuster about superheroes, nothing something that always delivers, but to do so would be to ignore the fact that there are good and bad examples of this and that The Avengers is one of the good ones. Colourful, busy, fun and generally very entertaining it delivers everything it sets out to do and I found it very enjoyable for this."
"The Avengers","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0848228/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt/","9"," If they can't save the box office, they sure as hell will avenge it ","I'm still having my fingers crossed that the Avengers will overtake Avatar as the most successful movie ever (until another movie burst and takes over that is). It would be such a great success and I would be so happy for Joss Wheddon. A real nerd amongst filmmakers he has made it big time. As we speak Avengers has broken quite a few records already and it is on a good roll. And all that is more than deserved. While I don't think it is necessary to have watched the other Marvel movies so far (especially not the different Hulks), the Avengers will make you want to watch more (look at your local video store for confirmation!).All the characters are here and have their moments. Maybe Thor is the one that gets a bit shorthanded time wise. But then again, he is god, so he wouldn't care anyway. Mark Ruffalo is winning (as a Charlie Sheen would say) with his performance as Hulk/Bruce Banner. Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man is entertaining as ever. And even if some claim that Captain America is not needed, I think he brings Gravitas and is more than valuable to counter the jokes of an Iron Man and bring some much needed bonding to the whole Crew. Chris Evans is perfect for that role.The movie has been criticized for the weak villain. I think that does injustice to the movie. While the characters (bar Hulk?) have been introduced to you, this still is a forming of a group. It is more about the Avengers, than it is about any villain. And I don't think Tom H. Loki is that weak (even if Hulk does disagree).I watched the movie twice now and I enjoyed it both times. Time flies by and you don't realize how fast 150 minutes can go by. I like the fact, that Joss does not treat the viewer as if he were stupid. So maybe some will not get the joke/bet between Capt. Americas character and Sam Jacksons character (though I reckon it won't be many), but I loved that the movie did not make a big deal out of it.Since this is a Marvel movie, you should know by now that there is a tag scene coming at the end. A friend of mine knew immediately what (or rather who) we saw there. You'll find the answer on the internet. That scene came in between the credits. There is another scene after the credits which as of yet, was not shown in Europe, but will hopefully make its way onto a digital release (DVD, Blu Ray or whatever comes next). I'm so looking forward to it ... oh and the 3D is nice, but its the story/characters and everything else that will sell you to the movie ..."
"The Avengers","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0848228/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt/","7"," "The world has gotten stranger than you even know." ","Well how do I put this across so it doesn't sound like I'm trying to trash the movie? I've been around since Stan Lee created Spider-Man, and some of the other Marvel super-heroes were around even before I was born. So I grew up at a time when the technology wasn't up to the task of putting what we see in today's Avengers on the big screen. With that said, it looks like what we have here is all sizzle and no steak. The CGI and special effects components of this flick makes it an all time blockbuster spectacle, so if that's what you're all about, you won't be disappointed. However if you're looking for a story with nuanced characters and an intriguing plot, you've come to the wrong movie. This is all about wringing out as much action and adrenaline pumping machismo that any fanboy could possibly ask for. So on that score it works, but I need something more, even in a super-hero movie.With that out of the way, there were some genuinely funny moments in the picture that added the slightest dimension to the principal characters. Of all the players, Robert Downey Jr. probably brings the greatest sense of professionalism to his portrayal of Iron Man. He's out there, he's serious when he has to be, and he's a wise guy when the situation warrants. As for the the CGI Hulk - who ever thought he'd wind up being the comedic sidekick in a story like this? He had at least two stellar moments that brought my theater to life, the rag doll whipping on old Loki (Tom Hiddleston), and the sidearm swat to Thor (Chris Hemsworth) that was so outrageous it just brought the house down.Apart from some of the witty comic book dialog, the rest was all relentless and gratuitously destructive special effects, exceptionally well done of course, but gosh, how much can a city take? Which by the way, is never dealt with as part of the aftermath of a super-hero barrage when a cosmic power like Loki comes to town. How about a film where citizen action groups bring charges against Iron Man, Thor and Hulk for destroying their city? Just kidding - how are you going to get them to court? Say, I know Stan Lee missed a cameo or two along the way in these Marvel flicks, so I was glad to see he showed up here, even though it was probably his quickest one ever. If you blinked you missed it during the cable news roundup following the final battle. It's going to be a sad day when Lee won't be around any more to make these appearances.And now for my final rant - as I write this, "The Avengers" has, in just two days, made it to #31 on IMDb's list of Top 250 Films. My post will be #495, so in less than a full weekend, movie goers have vaulted this film to a rating right up there in between "It's a Wonderful Life" and "Sunset Boulevard". Doesn't it seem like there's something wrong with this picture? Personally, if I were making the rules, I'd allow all the reviews in the world right out of the gate for a new release, but withhold ratings on a picture for at least a year or two after it's come out. OK, maybe six months. I think that would take some of the distortion out of the rating system, and someone like Joss Whedon wouldn't have to go around being embarrassed by comparisons to truly great films.Back to "The Avengers" - stick around for the closing credits for a preview of the next mind blowing Avengers flick. You know they'll be there because Nick Fury said so. THANOS!!! You think they can destroy more property than you saw done in this film? I'd bet on it."

Jackson) of S.H.I.E.L.D. brings together a team of super humans to form The Avengers to help save the Earth from Loki and his army.I want to first address the IMDb rating on this film. Currently, it sits at an 8.3 and is said to be the 140th greatest film of all time. Now, no matter how good you think it is, does anyone seriously believe it is one of the greatest films ever made? I mean, really? I grew up reading comic books, so the films are a bit of a different experience for me than they are for others. I think the movies have the comic fans as their biggest base, which is good, because otherwise several references and foreshadowings are going to be missed. If you do not know who Hawkeye is, for example, it may cause you to wonder why a government agent is jumping around and shooting off strange arrows.My biggest concern was: how do you make a movie about a team where the individuals have such strong personalities? Particularly the Hulk, who is not a team player. This was addressed."

This year alone has already seen "Black Panther". I won't deny that Stan Lee created a diverse variety of do-gooders in the Marvel Universe. "The Avengers" (not to be confused with the 1960s TV series) is entertaining enough. It's nothing special - much of it is sensory overload - but it's nothing that it doesn't pretend to be. Loki is the common suave but malevolent villain. He could trick anyone into thinking that he's a decent person. This movie will definitely please the Leonard Hofstadters, Sheldon Coopers, Howard Wolowitzes and Raj Koothrapalis of the world.It was a pleasant surprise to see that one of the people in the World Security Council got played by Jenny Agutter (the nurse in "An American Werewolf in London").

"The Avengers","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0848228/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt/","9"," Avengers Assemble ","The Marvel comic book based films have made millions at the box office, and everybody must have been thrilled with a number of the best superheroes of the series being put together in the same film, and presuming you have seen the previous films with them it has been building up to this. Basically Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), director of S.H.I.E.L.D., is meeting some colleagues in a remote facility where the energy source the Tesseract has been found and activated, opening a gateway transporting the Norse god Loki (Tom Hiddleston) from Asgard to Earth. He steals the powerful cube and takes over the minds of personnel like Clint Barton aka Hawkeye (The Hurt Locker's Jeremy Renner) and Dr. Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgrd), and this forces Fury to reactivate the Avengers Initiative, recruiting some of the world's most powerful and special heroes, starting with Natasha Romanoff aka Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson). She goes to find Bruce Banner aka The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) who is hiding somewhere in India for his scientific knowledge of the Tesseract - no mention of "The Other Guy", while Agent Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg) approaches Tony Stark aka Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) who also has technological knowledge - and his powerful mechanical suit, and Fury also brings Steve Rogers aka Captain America (Chris Evans) up to date with the situation, and he is still trying to get used to the modern world. While Loki disappeared into the abyss he was approached by the alien race the Chitauri, led by The Other (Alexis Denisof), and they came to an agreement that if they got the Tesseract they would help him take over the Earth. Suited up, Captain America and Iron Man travel to Germany where Loki is meant to be hiding and trying to ignite and stabilise the power of the cube, showing his evil intent to many people kneeling before him, he surrenders though when they fight and catch him. In this process though the villain's half-brother Thor (Chris Hemsworth) arrives, also transported from Asgard, and he plans to take and deal with him in his own way, and this turns into a fight between him, Iron Man and Captain America, but it eventually stops. Loki is placed into a cell, designed to hold The Hulk inside if Banner turns, and now with Thor recruited as well the Avengers argue about how to handle the alien dictator, and there is the revelation that S.H.I.E.L.D. plan to harness the Tesseract to develop weapons. Fury explains that he heard about what happened in Mexico, when Thor was previously on Earth, and that the attack makes Earth an easy target, and the weapons will be good defence for a similar attack, and as the argument continues Loki's mind controlled agents infiltrate the ship, the Helicarrier. Captain America and Iron Man try to start the engines again, while Thor tries fight against Banner who has become The Hulk and may destroy the ship from the inside, and fighting with Barton, Romanoff discovers a hard hit to the head will knock possessed people back to normal. In the struggle Loki kills Agent Coulson and escapes the ship, Banner as Hulk and Thor are ejected from the ship and fall to the ground, and Fury uses the death of Coulson to encourage the Avengers left to come together, work as a team and save the world. They know that the villain wants to become ruler as well as destroy cities, and using Dr. Selbig he has created a device to open the gateway and allow the Chitauri to invade and attack Manhattan, and it is up to Captain America, Iron Man, Black Widow, Hawkeye, Thor and The Hulk to save the day. In the end, after Dr. Selvig is revived, so much explosive fighting, and a prevented missile blowing up in space, Loki is taken back with the Tesseract by Thor to Asgard, the Avengers go their separate ways, until a new threat to the world emerges, and the final scene sees The Other meeting his master, who turns and reveals himself to be Thanos. Also starring Cobie Smulders as Agent Maria Hill, Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts, Paul Bettany as Jarvis, Sudden Death's Powers Boothe as World Security Council, Jenny Agutter as World Security Council, Harry Dean Stanton as Security Guard, Lou Ferrigno as the voice of The Hulk and a cameo by Stan Lee. The cast are all fantastic, Downey Jr. with all the quips, Evans as the sensible fighter, Ruffalo as the man trying to control his temper, Hemsworth as the arrogant warrior, Johansson as the confident female, and Jackson as the intelligent controller. It should be noted that the title was changed in Britain from The Avengers because there would be confusion with the Honor Blackman/Dianna Rigg TV series, and also there were small complaints about Spider-Man and Wolverine absent, but it doesn't matter. Anyway, the story and scripting are very well made, and what steals the show is the brilliantly paced fight sequences filled with the most spectacular and ground breaking special effects to create all the superhero gadgets and gimmicks, invading creatures, and constant explosions, this is definitely one of the greatest superhero movies of the last few years, a must see action fantasy. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Visual Effects, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Special Visual Effects. Very good!"
"The Avengers","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0848228/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt/","8"," Avengers Assemble ","When a revolutionary power source, known as the Tesseract, is brought into operation something goes wrong; it is meant to bring unlimited energy from outer space but instead it is used by the evil Loki to teleport himself to Earth. Using his powers he steals the Tesseract and takes control of scientist Dr Erik Selvig and SHIELD agent Clint Barton. He intends to give the Tesseract to The Other in exchange for an army to conquer Earth. First he will have to gain certain items to open a large enough portal for his army. Meanwhile SHIELD director Nick Fury assembles the world's superheroes to battle Loki. They aren't natural team players and are soon bickering and fighting amongst themselves. Loki is captured with surprising ease almost as if being captured was part of his plan.If you are a fan of the superhero genre then I'm sure this will be a must see; if like me you aren't exactly a fan of the genre but do enjoy the occasional superhero film then this is one that is worth watching. The fact that it includes several varied superheroes is rather fun. Having only seen the 'Iron Man' films and the old '70s Hulk TV series I wasn't familiar with most of them but that didn't really matter as it soon becomes apparent what powers each of them have and the reason for those powers isn't really important. There is lots of action throughout this is all pretty exciting and the technology they use looks great; I particularly liked the Helicarrier, a flying aircraft character reminiscent of the 'Cloud Base' in 'Captain Scarlet' only this one is introduced to us when it is in the water. Even on a fairly small scene the climactic scenes look good but would recommend watching on the largest screen you can to get the full effect. The cast does a fine job making their unbelievable characters believable. Overall I'd say this is a fine example of the genre that is suitable for all but younger children."
"The Avengers","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0848228/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt/","4"," What a load of Chitauri. ","Having already starred in their own standalone movies, Thor (Chris Hemsworth), The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo, taking over the role from Edward Norton), Captain America (Chris Evans), and Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) team up with Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) to form The Avengers, a team of superheroes-operating under the command of Nick Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D. (Samuel L. Jackson)-who are called upon to battle evil Asgardian Loki (Tom Hiddleston) when he threatens to invade the planet with his Chitauri army.The Avengers made an absolute mint at the box-office, proving to me that a large percentage of cinema-goers aren't all that fussed about an innovative or intelligible script just so long as they get plenty of bang for their buck. Written and directed by Joss Whedon, The Avengers Assemble (as it is known in the UK) is an unnecessarily convoluted superhero blockbuster wrapped around the most tired of premises: an evil being seeking a mystical energy source that will give him the power to rule the world. This trite set-up allows for countless effects filled battles during which no-one suffers anything more than a bruised ego.An impressive line-up of Hollywood A-listers and the most spectacular state-of-the-art CGI effects money can buy do not alter the fact that this is predictable, clichd nonsense told with little style, coherence or originality."

","Simple-minded live-action comic book extravaganza uniting Earth's resident superheroes to thwart Thor's adoptive brother Loki and his faceless army from destroying the world. The 3D effects aren't terribly good, though the film looks expensive and is top-heavy with crushing destruction (taking place in Manhattan, somewhat disconcerting in the post-9/11 years), coupled with blisteringly loud sound effects. Robert Downey Jr. brings his usual panache to the fore as Tony Stark/Iron Man, and Chris Evans is a wonderfully well-scrubbed Captain America, but others in the all-star cast (particularly Scarlett Johansson, Samuel L. Jackson, Mark Ruffalo and, in a cameo, Gwyneth Paltrow) just appear to be slumming. The script (by Joss Whedon, who also directed) could only be amazing and complex to comic book fans who haven't been comic book fans for very long.

"The Avengers","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0848228/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt/","7"," More superheroes... ","First of all I must admit that I am not much particularly a fan of superheroes in general, but I have seen the movies leading up to this, simply because they were available and I had the time. And I had read up on the hype around this movie, so I might as well give it a go as well.And as a fairly non-superhero kind of guy, well I must say that "The Avengers" was one interesting and exciting ride of an action movie. The story was, for me at least, rather slow paced up to the point where the alien army came through the portal. Sure, it was building up character and getting the various characters introduced properly to those not having seen any of the prior movies.The effects in "The Avengers" were top notch, as to be expected from a movie of this caliber. Lots of really great effects and visuals. However, when that aircraft carrier ship started to transform and then fly, I was ready to turn off the movie. That was just silly. But I decided to keep watching and look past that one particular horrendous scene.However, one thing did make me wonder, with all the destruction in New York, you didn't see a single civilian getting hit or killed in any way, that was just stupid, especially with so many people living there. In fact, you only saw very few deaths throughout the entire movie, which was sort of lame.Another thing puzzled me, when Bruce Banner turned into The Hulk for the first time in the movie, he was out of control, smashing everything and everyone in sight. But somehow he magically overcame that and was fully in control the second time. That just seemed very implausible and sort of contradicted what we had just seen at the first transformation.And as with the previous Marvel movies with these characters, they had some great performances to the movie. I think that it was actually Tom Hiddleston who plays Loki who put on the most memorable performance in the movie and stood out the most."The Avengers" was good entertainment, even for an anti-superhero guy like myself. Great action. Lots of destruction. And great special effects."

","Yes, Stan Lee does have a short 'cameo' role in The Avengers. I re-watched the first 10 or so minutes after I had seen the whole movie, doing so helps put the whole story in perspective. The USA, NASA, and the World Council are all interested in the small cube of energy captured at one time, it allows a portal to a different part of the universe. When it gets a mind of its own in the lab, the mythical god Loki appears with a giant burst of energy, and right away we see he is up to no good. If he can position the energy cube outside, pointed to the sky, his legions will be able to enter and take over the Earth. The main star, in a movie filled with stars, is Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark and Iron Man. We also have Chris Evans as Steve Rogers and Captain America, Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner and The Hulk, Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Loki's brother, Scarlett Johansson (my favorite) as Natasha Romanoff and Black Widow, and Jeremy Renner as Clint Barton and Hawkeye. Tom Hiddleston is good and sinister as Loki.We eventually find out, after Tony Stark figures it out, that Loki's approach is to alienate each human superhero against the others, divide and conquer. Humans are eventually saved when the six superheros band together and each uses his and her special powers to defeat the aliens.Of course there is lots of action, much of it taking place on a very large aircraft carrier that can transform itself into a giant flying carrier. Then the final action is in Manhattan, with quite a bit of destruction. In the end it is Stark as Iron Man that diverts a missile with a nuclear warhead, steering it through the upper opening of the portal, destroying the mothership which was responsible for keeping the battle going.Other key characters were Clark Gregg as Agent Phil Coulson, pretty Cobie Smulders dressed in a sleek black outfit as Agent Maria Hill, Stellan Skarsgrd as the scientist Selvig, Samuel L. Jackson as facility head Nick Fury, and Gwyneth Paltrow back as Stark's girl Friday, Pepper Potts .Overall a fine action comic book movie."
"The Avengers","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0848228/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt/","10"," Fun, and great characters and dialog first and foremost ","Any comic book movie - worth its salt far as budgets go - can give us terrific action with mind-blowing CGI and special effects. Marvel's The Avengers, the culmination of the work of five movies (one of them a sequel to the first, Iron Man), is stuffed with a good load of action and mayhem and a climax that bursts at the seams with aliens being torn apart by the heroes Captain America, Incredible Hulk, Thor and Tony Stark (plus relative newcomers Black Widow and Hawkeye, with Nick Fury and Agent Colson in the wings), and if you want to get your money shots, Joss Whedon doesn't skimp out. But the reason why he was chosen as the filmmaker here wasn't just for name cachet (though it probably helped).What Whedon's done over much of his career in TV and other films and webseries (Buffy, Firefly, Dr. Horrible, Angel, etc) was excel at bringing groups of people together against fantastical, supernatural, other-worldly/alien forces, but making it always about stakes, humor, horror, drama and solid conflicts. Villains don't just act nasty, they have their own logic and reasons for doing what they do, and if they're not sympathetic they certainly are understandable as characters, full of the stuff that makes them great to watch, especially with the best dialog probably out of anyone (i.e. the Mayor on Buffy, for those that recall).So here we get Loki, previously a villain in Thor (and later sort of brought back for Thor 2), and is by far the highlight of the film as Tom Hiddleston chews up scenery, but does it in a kind of elegant, theatrical, relishing way. By the time he spews out 'Muelling quim", you're on the edge of your seat. His performance, what he does with every moment of screen time, is much more exciting than any alien snake going through the sky. And yet his ego and petty-mindedness does him in, and Whedon has a lot of fun writing this character, making him a threat but someone who can be taken down under the circumstances.This is one of the best of the Marvel films just by the way that Whedon goes about the sort of 'Ghostbusters/Ninja Turtles' formula - the four main players, each distinct, playing off one another, but things could turn on a dime any moment amid the jokes and this and that. Along with Hiddleston, Downey once again makes Tony Stark a helluva great character to take in as he is constantly thinking even as he is laying his sarcasm and deadpan on the other characters. And Johansson actually has a few really great scenes - Whedon has always written women characters as complex to the point that they put other "complex" male characters to shame - and somehow amid the many characters and plot turns going on, she stands out, especially Widow's scene with Loki. Ruffalo, too, does a lot with a little... until he gets to the "other guy".I don't know if Avengers is great art, but it does what I want to see when I go to big giant behemoth-like spectacles: provide me a host of characters who have to work together, and gives them interesting, entertaining and believable things to say. At 142 minutes it goes by at a great pace as well - not too fast, not too slow, nothing drags here, and that counts as well. Along with the first Iron Man and the recent Marvel Netflix show Daredevil, this is the MCU at the top of their game."

Yay, I have now seen Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, and the Hulk battle Loki and his minions from Asgard as the latter try to invade New York City. Co-written and directed by legendary TV icon Joss Whedon ("Buffy the Vampire Slayer", "Angel", and "Firefly"), he does not disappoint with his love of pop culture and comics as he gives the Marvel characters their justly celebrated status as the distinct characters we've grown to love growing up reading their illustrated adventures in the four-color world they inhabit. And seeing it all in 3-D is such an awesome experience! Oh, and it's great in also seeing Hawkeye, Black Widow, and Nick Fury in tow. Really, all I'll say is you must watch The Avengers. P.S. Seeing Cobie Smulders as one of the characters makes me wonder if she and her "How I Met Your Mother" co-star Alyson Hannigan, formerly a "Buffy" star, have traded stories of what it's like to work for Mr. Whedon. How I'd like to be a fly on that wall!"

"12 Years a Slave","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2024544/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt/","8"," Among the better films of 2013 ",""12 Years a Slave" is an unusual story about slavery and its evils because unlike most films, this one is based on the true story of a black man who was free but was kidnapped and sold into slavery in the early-mid 19th century. Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor) was a happy man--with a wife and kids. However, once kidnapped, as the title suggests, he disappeared for 12 years and was treated brutally. The film shows his MANY trials--including beatings, attempted hangings and witnessing rapes and other atrocities.The Oscar winners will be announced tomorrow and there is a lot of buzz for "12 Years a Slave" as well as "Gravity". I saw both in the last two days and would easily pick "Gravity". Now this is NOT because I think "12 Years a Slave" is a bad film. No, it's quite good. However, it's also a rather straight-forward narrative punctuated by many scenes of brutality--and not all that different from films such as "The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman", "Roots" or "Amistad". It's all very sad but doesn't really break much new ground. Whereas the entire production of "Gravity" is unlike anything ever made before--and has a completely unique and breathtaking space adventure that looks and feels as if you are there. To me, this makes "Gravity" my pick--though both are very good films.By the way, I mentioned the brutality in "12 Years a Slave". All of it was very appropriate to include in the film but it's simply too rough for kids. Think twice before you allow younger viewers to watch it or, better yet, watch it with them."
"12 Years a Slave","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2024544/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt/","8"," Not quite extraordinary, still tremendously powerful ","With many fine actors, a remarkable subject matter and the number of accolades it received, '12 Years a Slave' was watched by me with high expectations.For me, '12 Years a Slave' is not quite as good as the hype and isn't one of my favourite Best Picture winners. It could have been truly extraordinary, but it wasn't quite despite having individual elements that were that adjective. Can see though why it has been so well received, while also seeing where those who didn't like it are coming from in their reservations (though not sharing the vitriolic way they've been expressed by some). It may not be perfect, but from personal opinion, and quite a big number of others, it was tremendously powerful and very brave,'12 Years A Slave' may have some one-sided and conveniently black and white characterisation. It may not say anything new about the subject. Some of the cast, like Paul Giamatti and Benedict Cumberbatch (though they are excellent still), are underused. And Brad Pitt and his dialogue did feel out of place and the dialogue additionally coming over as heavy-handed. On the other hand, to tell the story from the viewpoint of the enslaved was a brave decision in an industry where few films have done it, and it comes over very well on the whole. The treatment of the slaves is not for the faint-hearted, they are shockingly harrowing and not comfortable to watch but they don't feel that gratuitous. There are some emotionally devastating moments, such as the ending and the long shot of Northup singing.Steve McQueen was the right director for the film, a film that needed to be told in a brutal and honest way and being a director with that directing style McQueen brings that out perfectly in a bravura directing job. '12 Years a Slave' is very impressive visually and technically, and Hans Zimmer's score is suitably stirring.John Ridley's script adapts Northup's memoir with tautness, honesty and sincerity, not subtly mind you but it's not a subtle subject. It only falters with Pitt's dialogue. The acting is superb, with Chiwetel Ejiofor's powerfully restrained and sincere performance wholly deserving of its acclaim. Lupita N'Yong'o, very moving, and Michael Fassbender, at his most frightening, are more than up to his level, as are Sarah Paulson and Paul Dano. Overall, extraordinary it isn't but an emotionally impactful film it certainly is. 8/10 Bethany Cox"
"12 Years a Slave","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2024544/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt/","9"," Degradation and Despair ","During the days of the big studio system slavery was a topic that was generally avoided. The standard interpretation of the era's history made such work as Birth Of A Nation and later Gone With The Wind the way we saw the era. It was the Civil Rights Revolution that opened a lot eyes and now with a bit of perspective there, a film like the incredible true story 12 Years A Slave could be made.Not only is it true what happens to Chiwetel Ejifor's character this was hardly a unique situation. Slave catchers were really down on the social scale even at that time, but it was a business to them. So of course if you can't find a genuine runaway slave, why just take any black person that answers a general description. Naturally free black people were on the alert, but these two low lifes who capture him use stealth and planning to bring him to the south and sell him.This story of degradation and despair is a future cinema classic and ought to be required viewing in schools and for those who think any group of human kind deserves to be treated in this way. Slave owners knew exactly what they were doing when it was forbidden to educate a slave. If you remember in Band Of Angels Clark Gable did educate the child who grew up to be Sidney Poitier almost to his dying regret. The hardest thing that Ejifor has to do is conceal his education in order to survive.Michael Fassbender plays the last and worst of a series of plantation owners who Ejifor is in slavery to. Fassbender is amazing to watch as his character sinks into moral degeneracy as more and more he has to justify this system. The saddest story in the film is not our protagonist's. Rather it is that of Lupita Nyong'o who plays a woman separated from her children when she's sold off in a slave market which is placed in someone's parlor. The degradation and misery she endures can only be compared to Schindler's List and clearly 12 Years A Slave was influenced by that Spielberg masterpiece. You have to a Medusa victim not to be moved by Nyong'o on the screen."
"12 Years a Slave","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2024544/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt/","8", Incredible Story with Brilliant Lead Performance ","12 Years a Slave (2013) *** (out of 4)A rather remarkable true story about Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor), a free Northern black man who is kidnapped and sold into slavery where he spends twelve years away from his family and living in some of the worst conditions imaginable. 12 YEARS A SLAVE is a good to very good movie but I'm going to fall a little shy of calling it one of the year's best for a couple reasons. For starters, while the score itself is quite brilliant, with the film it just doesn't work. The score at times comes off way too over-dramatic and especially during the more shocking moments of the film where we see the slaves being beaten or worse. I personally feel that these scenes are so shocking and revolting on their own that there really wasn't a need for such an over-the-top and dramatic score to be blazing. Another problem I had is that there really wasn't a good flow to the picture or story as it just seemed like we were seeing vignettes put together to show various aspects of Northup's life. With that said, there's no question that Ejiofor delivers one of the year's greatest performance. I think the screenplay and story certainly give him a lot to work with but the actor does a marvelous job with it. There are so many different emotions to this character but the actor pulls them off remarkably. The character's whole thoughts on the slavery, how to react to certain situations and other obstacles are very much on display and it's terrific how Ejiofor is able to show the viewer how the character is thinking. The supporting cast has some major actors with Michael Fassbender doing a very good job at a rather evil slave owner. You've also got Lipita Nyong'o nearly stealing the film as Patsey, an abused slave. There's also Paul Giamatti, Alfre Woodard and Brad Pitt in smaller but memorable roles. Director Steve McQueen does a very good job at showing off the horrors of the slaves but I also liked some of the smaller scenes where we see Northup interacting with other slaves. There are some quiet moments scattered around the violence that are quite touching and bring a certain human touch to the various evils that we are seeing. While not perfect, 12 YEARS A SLAVE does tell a pretty remarkable story and it's worth seeing."
"12 Years a Slave","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2024544/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt/","8"," Heartbreaking and ultimately depressing ","12 YEARS A SLAVE is the third film in a row I've seen by director Steve McQueen with a 'worthy' theme (the first two were HUNGER and SHAME). This is by far his biggest production to date, with an enhanced budget and some of an epic feel to the true-life tale of a 19th century man who was kidnapped and sold into slavery. Solomon Northrup's life story is harrowing indeed although the only outcome of such a production is for the viewer to feel depressed.The film is a bit like Tarantino's DJANGO UNCHAINED but without the feel-good escapist stuff. Instead this is a dark movie that just gets darker and darker. It's a very well made production, featuring top-tier acting from a huge cast presided over by the great Chiwetel Ejiofor who I've had my eye on for a long time ever since he impressed me in CHILDREN OF MEN. Michael Fassbender is particularly outstanding as the ruthless slave owner although Benedict Cumberbatch and Brad Pitt also do well with their lesser roles. Most of the disturbing stuff involves newcomer Lupita Nyong'o and very convincing she is too.The real star of the show is McQueen himself, whose direction is often breathtaking. The cinematography is really exceptional and contrasts the beauty of the natural surroundings with the ugliness of the human activity taking place within them. I liked the way McQueen took time out for some slow, lingering moments which are worthy of Herzog. Personally I'm a fan of escapism myself so this isn't the kind of film I could force myself to sit through again, as important as it is; it's depressing and heartbreaking in equal measure, but a film that everyone should watch once."
"12 Years a Slave","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2024544/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt/","9"," Impressive and compelling ","Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor) is a free black family man living in Saratoga, New York. In 1841, he is lured by two men who hire him to play his violin. When they arrive in Washington, he is abducted and given the false identity of a runaway slave. He is smuggled back into the deep south to be sold to the somewhat kind William Ford (Benedict Cumberbatch). However he runs afoul of the jealous chief carpenter John Tibeats (Paul Dano) and Ford sells him to the cruel Edwin Epps (Michael Fassbender). Patsey (Lupita Nyong'o) is the best cotton picker and she's constantly raped by Epps. His wife (Sarah Paulson) knows it and targets her anger on the helpless slave. It's a dangerous life and Northup must hide his identity from everyone. It's only until Canadian Bass (Brad Pitt) that he can truly rely on somebody to help him.This is more than a slave movie. The fact that this is an educated man forced into slavery puts it closer to the audience. It's easier to see one's self in the Northup character in that he starts off as a regular family guy. His trials and tribulations are more compelling because of it. The performance of Chiwetel Ejiofor just reinforces that idea. He's not a superhero. He struggles. He's afraid. He's just a guy off the streets. The other performances are just as outstanding. Each one is as impressive as the next. Brad Pitt does stick out a little and I wish a smaller actor could play the part. This is the most impressive movie I've seen from Steve McQueen."
"12 Years a Slave","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2024544/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt/","6"," Worth a watch for the performances and historic background ","Before I write a review, I usually make notes. Now it has been really long since I watched this movie and in my notes it says that this is likely gonna win Best Picture and possibly Best Actor (Ejiofor) and Supporting Actor (Fassbender) at the 2014 Academy Awards. And even if "only" Lupita Nyong'o won from the acting nominees, that should still not hurt the overall perception of this quality film. Even if I probably wouldn't put it anywhere near my top5 or probably top10, it still made for a good viewing experience.Nyong'o gave a captivating performance and even if I probably would have preferred June Squibb to take it, I am pretty glad Lupita won the award as a complete newcomer to film roles in a very very close race over another very overrated performance by Jennifer Lawrence. "12 Years a Slave" is a biopic on a talented Black violinist who, before the Civil War, gets tricked, captivated and put into slavery. One thing I found fairly interesting was the role of the people who gave him that poisoned drink to make the physically clearly superior man unconscious and take him to his new master. As interesting as these men is Northup's state of mind and how it takes very long for him to realize what actually happened and that it was all a put-up affair.There are not that many films about slavery as you may expect, so this topic was unsurprisingly right up the Academy's alley. Northup's liberation and following reunion with his family served as the emotional highlights of the movie, but did not get me as involved as I might have hoped. One thing that touched me more on an emotional level is when one of the female slaves is separated from her children as they went to a different slave owner than she did. The movie has, apart from Ejiofor, strong supporting performances from start to finish, the good, the bad and the very bad (special mention to Paul Dano).This movie is particularly worth watching for the historical background as we see that, at this point in time, blacks were basically no more than cattle. And yet there were people who treated them with respect (Pitt's and Cumberbatch's characters). Also it teaches audiences some things they may not have known, for example that there were also white "slaves", such as the one who tries to betray Northup. One thing I did not like at all about this film, was Brad Pitt's performance. It's all so much holier-than-thou to an almost cringeworthy degree with Pitt never disappearing into character here like everybody else in the film, but just being a bit of a messiah who risks his life to save Northup's. It really made me chuckle. Shame that he got an Oscar for this, even if it was a producing Oscar as acting-wise this may very well be Pitt's most embarrassing performance so far.Nonetheless, I recommend watching "12 Years a Slave". It never starts to drag despite crossing the 2-hour-mark considerably."
"12 Years a Slave","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2024544/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt/","5"," 12 Years a Slave ","12 Years a Slave won the Best Picture Oscar. British Director Steve McQueen became the first black briton to accept an Oscar as producer.Based on true events. Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor) is a free black man in New York. Well to do, a violinist who is tricked, drugged and sold into slavery in Louisiana in 1842.Solomon has to survive hardship and cruelty especially as he lived a relatively privileged life with his wife and young children.He becomes a slave to Ford (Benedict Cumberbatch) who shows some Christian kindness to his slaves. He even listens to Solomon's ideas. However his farm hand Tibeats (Paul Dano) is a cruel sadistic racist that Solomon beats up.Ford ensures that Solomon is not lynched but sells him on to Edwin Epps (Michael Fassbender) who is a cruel twisted man filled with liquor and religious scripture.Epps also lusts after his black slave Patsey (Lupita Nyong'o) who he regularly rapes. Epps wife hates Patsey knowing her husband's fascination for her.Solomon plans his escape. He can read and write and eventually meets a kindly abolitionist.McQueen pulls no punches. This is not the alt right false view of slavery. This is brutal and degrading. Your fate is at the whim of your master's view at any time of the day. Even if your master is benevolent like Ford. You are still his property and you have his underlings who will show their sadism.Ejiofor does well in showing his character's dignity. It takes him a while to realise that he was tricked by the people who invited him to dine with them.Despite being made by a black filmmaker. It suffers from torture porn. It is something I have a distaste of in black dramas ever since I watched Roots as a kid back in the late 1970s."
"12 Years a Slave","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2024544/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt/","8"," Another Great Story of Injustice ","In 1841, the Afro-American violinist Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor) is a free man, living with his wife and children in Saratoga Springs, New York. He is hired by two men for a two-week tour in Washington with their theatrical company. However Solomon is kidnapped and sold as a slave in New Orleans with the nickname Platt. Along twelve years, he works in the plantations and has abusive treatment of his masters, until the day he meets the Canadian abolitionist Bass (Brad Pitt) that promises to send a letter to his family."12 Years a Slave" is another great story of injustice and the saga of Solomon Northup is as sad as Jean Valjean in "Les Misrables". Steve McQueen made a heartbreaking movie but the plot is based only on the injustice with Solomon Northup; what can the viewer say about the other poor slaves badly treated bu their masters. "12 Years a Slave" is a great movie but did not deserve to win the Oscar, competing against "Gravity" and "Captain Phillips". My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "12 Anos de Escravido" ("12 Years a Slave")"
"12 Years a Slave","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2024544/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt/","8", Absorbing, brutal and moving in a detached and visually beautiful way ","A few years ago now, Mel Gibson made Passion of the Christ; a film which essentially is one long tale of suffering of Jesus on his way to the cross. It was a film that I found to be as vacuous as pornography and an ordeal to sit through because I lost all feeling for the character as he became little more than the subject for violence. I mention this because I worried that this film would be the same as it is very much an issue film and much has been written about how numbing it is in terms of the content. I decided to watch it anyway, mainly because of the British involvement in the film a lot of talent here, not least of which is director Steve McQueen.The story is based on the true story of a free man kidnapped into slavery. As a story it is one of interest but mainly it provides a central tangible point for the audience to identify with and to follow. It also gives us the oft-used narrative device of a character seeing things for the first time as we are (see also the rookie cop etc). In this way it works very well because we never really get lost in the violence or brutality of the film and, despite the claims of some, it never made me numb to it and it never felt like it was being overdone for the sake of it if anything it builds very well so it get progressively harder to process. The film shows the extent of the system much better than just a series of beatings; it shows that even "good" men are part of it, it shows that the options are zero and it shows that it is a world that has no edges even though we know that Solomon is just a matter of distance from his rightful freedom, we never really feel that way at all because it is never escaping one place or one person.The story is well told to keep close to Solomon while also letting us see the reality and McQueen is excellent as director in how he shows it. In Hunger and Shame he sits back from his subjects in a rather detached but invasion way. It is hard to describe but long, wide shots leave us to observe simple scenes and often the simpler they are the more telling as Solomon hangs while others go about their business, we understand the reality of this world and how utterly trapped everyone is again, it is a system, this is just how it works. The relationship with Bobbitt continues to pay dividends because visually the film is stunning, great colors and great shots whether they be unflinching close-ups or wide and long. The use of music is good too there is no sentimentality to it and when it is used it is subtle. This is not a film that overdoes the violence to hype it, but nor is a film that pulls on the heartstrings it feels very factual and very realistic within the context of the system, so while the audience flinch at a particular brutal scene, the film itself does not because this is how it is in the world we are in.The cast give very good performances in support of this goal, so while some of them are basic roles, the people give good presence and don't ham it up. In particular Ejiofor gets the balance right, his desperation and horror is pushed down as much as he can because of how the system he is in works, but he engages and moves throughout. Fassbender likewise walks the line he is never a pantomime villain but he is still cruel and hateful. Supporting roles from Nyong'o, Dano, Williams and many others is roundly very good with only one misstep which is Pitt, which is a shame his face is almost too famous and breaks the ensemble feel, plus the virtue of his character also makes his casting in that specific role seem a little bit like a vanity casting for a producer. This is a minor thing though, since he himself is not bad, but anyway the rest of the cast are convincing and engaging.12 Years a Slave looks like it will be just another Oscar-baiting slavery film, but it is much better than that to be fair the awards hype sullies it a little bit. It is absorbing and brutal in its convincing and detached portrayal of this world, complete with strong performances it is a memorable experience and very well made film."

In spite of his skills and education he could not secure himself a position away from hard labor.The film depicts graphic beatings, plantation owners infidelity with the slaves, and or course white racist slave owners in a bad light.

"12 Years a Slave","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2024544/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt/","9"," "It's a fact, a plain and simple fact, that what is true and right is true and right for all." ","Well tonight is Oscar night as I write this, and this picture will likely garner it's share of awards. It deserves it's accolades, but I have to say, it's tough picture to watch at times. The whipping scenes in particular are extremely brutal, and just as in "The Passion of the Christ", I have to wonder if any person's human body can stand up to that type of torture. It's too graphic even for words, and rending another person's flesh as depicted seems almost incomprehensible.Which is the point I guess. The brutality of slavery is on display here in all it's horror, and in today's politically charged climate, this makes for exceptional Oscar fodder. Too bad it were not otherwise. The film could probably win on it's own merits without the politics of the Academy involved, and if it does win Best Picture, who will know for sure? Of course this all a few hours before the fact, so in a little while I guess all the guessing games can begin.As well as the picture itself, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Lupita Nyong'o are solid contenders for their respective categories. The scene where Patsey begs Solomon to end her misery was a standout for me, and spoke to the unbearable circumstances so often associated with slavery and it's horrors. Again, a tough picture to watch, but probably an important one if it helps bridge the atrocities of a past century with healing instead of divisiveness."
"12 Years a Slave","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2024544/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt/","8"," The Most Honest Look at Slavery? ","In the antebellum United States, Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor), a free black man from upstate New York, is abducted and sold into slavery.No film from 2013 has been more rewarded and awarded than "12 Years a Slave", and with good reason -- an incredible (yet true) plot fleshed out by some remarkable actors that really captures what slavery was like without the gratuitous violence of exploitation or the overt sentimentality of a Spielberg film. There is no surprise that the film has captured the top slot in many critics' lists and enters the Oscar race with an impressive nine nominations.Right off the bat let us say that if "12 Years a Slave" wins Best Picture at the Academy Awards, there is no shame in that. This is the kind of film that deserves to win, as it both looks good and covers a topic of great importance. Slavery may not be in the forefront of our minds, but it is always a part of American history we have to live with. That is why I think this film will take the statuette home.After that, the race gets a lot more complicated. A win for adapted screenplay seems fair, as this story more than adequately brings to life historical figures in a way that comes across -- dare I say it -- entertaining, while also being honest and truthful to the source.But a best actor for Chiwetel Ejiofor? This is hard to say. While no one would argue he did not deserve such an award, he happens to be up against Matthew McConaughey in "Dallas Buyers Club". For both men, this is the role that will be the peak of their careers most likely, and I have to say McConaughey gave just a little bit more. So the edge is slight but evident.The exact same situation awaits Michael Fassbender, who was devious as Edwin Epps without becoming a caricature. He is this year's Christoph Waltz, which is quite the feat. But against Jared Leto? Again, the edge tends to favor the actor who put his own physical health on the line, and I think Fassbender will come in second.Lupita Nyong'o as Patsey could get an award. The actress fields are not as strong this year as in the past, and it would be a good time to sneak in past the more established people in the field. (Although her role is small, I was also pleased to see Quvenzhan Wallis as Margaret Northup. Regardless of how everything turned out, "Beasts of the Southern Wild" was the film of 2012 thanks to her.) The only really disappointing thing was the presence of Brad Pitt as Bass, the film's hero (if there is one). Whether or not his acting was good, the part seemed all wrong. Pitt stands out as too recognizable in this world, and when he appears it is as if out of nowhere, proudly talking down his employer with repercussions. Was this necessary? Did we need what amounts to a 21st century man breaking the fourth wall to save the day?That nitpick aside, this is an excellent film and deserves any and all honors that come its way."
"12 Years a Slave","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2024544/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt/","10"," nothing can show us the full brutality of slavery, but this comes close ","Solomon Northup's story of his kidnapping and sale into slavery got widely read upon its original publication but then disappeared as the Confederates built up an idealized image of the antebellum south (exemplified in "Gone with the Wind"). Now that Northup's story has gotten brought to the screen, it's important for everyone to see it. "12 Years a Slave" not only takes an uncompromising look at the sheer brutality of slavery, but also shows how nothing could take away Northup's dignity and his hope that he would one day be a free man again. One of the ugliest scenes is the whipping of a slave for perceived disobedience.Most of the credit goes to Chiwetel Ejiofor as Northup, showing him to be a man who wouldn't let even the most vicious treatment break him. The rest of the cast deserves ample kudos, but Steve McQueen deserves credit for bringing to the screen a story that got suppressed for over a century.This movie should also motivate us all to take a serious look at the plantation system and the fact that the US economy got built on it. George Washington and Thomas Jefferson owned slaves, and the White House is the product of slave labor.In the end, this definitely deserved Best Picture. Three quarters of a century after the pro-Confederate "Gone with the End" won big, we are finally seeing atonement. If you see only one movie this year, make it "12 Years a Slave"."
"12 Years a Slave","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2024544/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt/","9"," 12 Years a Slave ","I heard about this film during it's release, I knew it had the star of Love Actually and The Shadow Line in it, and then awards season started, this was one of the most nominated, I had to see why, from Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated director Steve McQueen (Hunger, Shame). Based on the autobiography of the real man, in the year 1841, Solomon Northup (BAFTA winning, and Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Chiwetel Ejiofor) is a free black man living in the society of Saratoga Springs, New York with his wife Anne Northup (Kelsey Scott) and two children, and he makes a living as a violinist, but his life is snatched from him when two men, Brown (Scoot McNairy) and Hamilton (Taran Killam), take him out of town to what he believes will be a music gig, but he is drugged and chained up. Northup is sold into slavery, given the name of an escaped slave, Platt, and taken to the deep south of New Orleans, upscale but callous slave trader Theophilus Freeman (Paul Giamatti) sells him to good-willed plantation owner William Ford (Benedict Cumberbatch), the master is kind to let him have a violin. Tension rise between him and racist carpenter John Tibeats (Paul Dano) who verbally abuses him, to the point when they fight, afterwards Northup endures hours of agony in a noose, Ford sees the only way to save him is to sell him to Edwin Epps (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Michael Fassbender), Ford has a debt to pay so cannot listen to his pleas of his identity. Epps is a vicious master, believing he has the right to abuse his slaves according to pro-slavery verses in the Bible, both true and false ones, he encourages the slaves to accept whatever they endure, and they will be beaten unless they pick up to 200 pounds of cotton every day, one slave who is praised lustfully by Epps, picking up to 500 pounds a day, is Patsey (Oscar winning, and BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Lupita Nyong'o), who Northup becomes close friends with as they endure their traumas. Patsey is violently abused by the envious and nasty wife Mistress Epps (Sarah Paulson) at many opportune moments, and Epps himself rapes the girl repeatedly, and Patsey feels so weak and horrified with her situation that she asks Northup to assist her suicide, but he refuses, he meanwhile along with other slaves are leased to a neighbouring plantation due to cotton worms, apparently a godly plague, and there he gains favour from the owner who lets him play his violin at a wedding anniversary celebration and keep his earnings. Northup wants to use his earnings to try and send a message home, he pays white field hand and former overseer Armsby (Garret Dillahunt) to send a letter to his friends in New York, the man takes the money but betrays him, Epps is informed but is just about convinced by Northup that the story is untrue, and he is tearfully forced to burn the letter, his only hope for freedom. Patsey one day goes missing from the plantation, she returns revealing that she was fetching soap as Epps' wife refuses to give her any to clean, and in anger Epps orders her stripped and tied to a tree, the wife encourages her husband to get Northup to whip her, he reluctantly agrees and does so, but Epps takes the whip wanting it done more savagely, and she is lashed until severely wounded and unconscious. While Patsey heals Northup starts building a gazebo with a fellow construction worker, white Canadian carpenter Bass (Brad Pitt, also producing), he is opposed to slavery which displeases Epps, but Northup confides in this man about his kidnapping and formerly being a free man, he once again asks for help sending a letter to New York, and Bass agrees to risk his life and do so. Eventually the local sheriff calls Northup over, he is asked a series of questions based on the letter of facts received, and he instantly recognises the shopkeeper with him, they have come to free him, Epps is angry at his slave being taken and Patsey is devastated to lose her friend, but he is taken away immediately. Having been enslaved for twelve years Northup returns to life as a free man and an emotional reunion with his wife, older children and a grandchild, the end text tells that the law could not convict those who forced Northup into slavery, and also that the details of his death and burial have never been found. Also starring Adepero Oduye as Eliza and Alfre Woodard as Mistress Shaw. Ejiofor is absolutely compelling as the black man who has his life stolen from him as he is forced into slavery, Fassbender is fantastic as the unsympathetic and malicious slave master, Nyong'o is magnificent as the female slave often hideously raped and beaten, and Cumberbatch, Giamatti and Pitt all do their supporting roles very well also. Apart from Django Unchained, this is one of the only films about slavery from the point of view of an enslaved person, the period detail is impeccable, the brutal and shocking material such as constant "N" words, torture and violence is poignant, and the emotions of suffering, misery, courage and hope seen throughout truly impress, McQueen is a true perfectionist and this film is absolute must see, a brilliant period drama based on a true story. It won the Oscars for Best Motion Picture of the Year and Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Costume Design, Best Film Editing and Best Production Design, it won the BAFTA for Best Film, and it was nominated for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music for Hans Zimmer, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Cinematography and Best Editing, Best Production Design, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama, and it was nominated for Best Screenplay and Best Original Score. Very good!"
"12 Years a Slave","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2024544/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt/","3"," Unspeakable Abuse. ","Solomon Northrup is a freeman with a wife and children, living in Saratoga, New York, in the years before the Civil War. He makes his living as a fiddler, and when he's invited to join a troupe for a gig in Washington, he agrees. In Washington, he's drugged by his partners, given a false identity, and sold down the river into slavery in Louisiana. After twelve years, he finds his way home.I hate to say this but I found the movie lush but repellent. I can't imagine -- well, maybe I can -- that there are viewers who don't know what slavery in the South was like.In addition, despite its being based on Northrup's memoirs, I thought the scenes of punishment, though well done, were overemphasized and sometimes unconvincing. For instance, the two men who take Northrup from Saratoga to Washington. They have dinner in an elegant Washington hotel, after which Northrup vomits in an alley and is put to bed by his companions, where he sleeps soundly until he wakes up manacled in a dungeon. I can believe his companions got Northrup drunk and sold him out, but drugged? It's a common movie device. The original "Mickey Finn", chloral hydrate, wasn't used as a hypnotic until 1869. Before that, there was nothing that could knock Northrup out. I wish the movie had been honest and simply shown him having a good time in the big city and overcelebrating.That initial suspicion runs through the entire movie. Some of the events are eminently believable, others not. I can certainly believe the brutal beatings, rapes, destruction of families, and lynchings. But the director's camera lingers on them, far too long, long after we understand the import of the scene. You've seen lashes dealt out before, aboard sailing ships and on plantations, but you have never seen so many, nor have they lasted so long. It begins to seem as if the film intends not only to depict the brutality but to revel in it. It starts to look a little like a member of the emerging genre of torture porn.I realize that criticizing a film like this isn't exactly politically correct, and yet we've seen it before, even if less lavishly displayed. It's been thirty years or more since "Roots." Except that here, the director has thrown in some sex -- full frontal female nudity, masturbation in the midst of misery -- just in case you find yourself bored with the atrocities. I have a similar problem with movies about the Nazi genocide. The subjects carry so much in the way of moral outrage that a simple-minded, commercial approach cheapens the tragedy.The photography and wardrobe are just fine. The dialog is stilted, like "True Grit" with no wit. Apparently the antebellum South never heard of contractions like "don't" or "won't". "Slavery is an evil that should not be permitted." That's the way people wrote, in Spencerian script, not the way they spoke. The N word is used without restraint, but I give that a pass because it's evidently historically accurate.I gave it an hour before I was too disgusted to go on. Yet, I think it's a valuable movie for the one in five Americans who can't name the country we achieved our independence from, according to a 2011 poll taken on the Fourth of July. Maybe they really DON'T know."

","It was 1841 and black slavery was still going strong in the USA, particularly in the South. Much of the story here is set in Southern Louisiana and was actually filmed there, including in New Orleans proper. A street was even blocked off and dirt brought in to simulate an old upstate New York town in one scene. Several of the old plantation homes in surrounding areas were used for filming.Chiwetel Ejiofor, who received an Oscar nomination for his role, is Solomon Northup, a free black man with a wife and two small children in upstate New York. He plays violin and during one period when his wife was gone away for a few weeks to work as a cook, he is befriended by two men who say they are with a traveling troupe, a circus of sorts, and Solomon can make good money with his violin playing. He goes with them and, after a night of too much drinking, awakes to find himself shackled. He had been kidnapped and then put on a boat down to New Orleans. He ended up having to work as a slave, and also to conceal his true identity, for black men who could read and write were a threat and would likely be hanged to their death.This is based on a true story of the real Solomon Northup who was forced into illegal slavery for 12 years. It is a good story, it shows probably very accurately what slavery was like. I do have objections, many scenes move very slowly, and scenes of beatings or near hangings dwell on the horror of it a bit too long. We know it was evil and wrong, we don't need to see so much graphic gore.But overall it is a well-told story, and of course it won the Oscar for best picture. To me the best actor here was Brit Michael Fassbender as the cruel slave owner.SPOILERS: After 12 years Solomon was working on a project when he came across an abolitionist from Canada (Brad Pitt), and told him his story, asking him to contact people he knew in New York. Later someone came for him with law enforcement, Solomon was able to return to his home and family in New York. Historically, it isn't totally clear what his fate was after that."

It's a brutal story. You see these people treated like merchandise, separated from their children, and the cruelty of the land managers.Northrup at first is pretty lucky -- he is sold to one of the more humane landowners, Ford (Cumberbatch), who takes advantage of the fact that Northrop is an excellent musician and reads the Bible to them on Sundays. As Cumberbatch points out, though, Ford isn't a nice guy -- he like the rest of them use slaves as their economy is dependent upon it. What's even worse about Ford is that he has no control over his horrid manager.In order to keep Northrop from being killed by said manager, Ford sells him to another owner, Edwin Epps (Fassbender), a complete nightmare who is taking sexual advantage of one of his slaves, Patsy (Lupita Nyong'o) and enjoys being mean. His wife is jealous of Patsy and also makes her life a living hell.All of the performances are excellent, and this movie was filmed in Louisiana and is gorgeous to look at, belying the sadness and horror.Great movie."
"12 Years a Slave","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2024544/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt/","10"," looking long and hard at slavery ","The power of the adaptation of Solomon Northrup's memoir, directed by Steve McQueen and written by John Ridley, is time. Not just the time Northrup spent, or the time that slaves were already there for generations by this point of the 1840's, and that it was an institution completely set in its place, but in cinema. Case in point is when Solomon - aka 'Platt' by the slave-trader who put him away - is strung up following a fight with one of the 'masters' played by Paul Dano, and he would be hung but there's a problem with doing that without the main master on hand. So, Solomon is just left to hang. For hours. And McQueen fixes his camera on him hung up with a little dirt under his feet to keep him up... and people behind him, slaves, children, go on about their concerns and things. Only one dares come up to him, but only to give a quick drink of water.12 Years a Slave explores not only the wholly immorality and evil of slavery, but its pervasiveness in modern culture. It features some of the greatest cinematic metaphors, without any overbearance. Or, maybe, it IS over-bearing, like 'LOOK AT WHAT'S GOING ON!' and no one doing anything. In a sense Solomon up on the noose is a metaphor for racism in general, that it's such a common occurrence that people get used to it. The institution of enslavement and imprisonment is not too dissimilar here to that shown in The Shawshank Redemption - also about a man put falsely in bondage. The difference this time is that it's not for any wrongfully accused crime. Simply put, if Solomon wasn't black, this wouldn't have happened to him. Or to anyone.Of course this story of a man being taken away from freedom and a family and an artistically nourishing life is inherently compelling n(he works as a fiddler, and music is made as a great point of reference in the film as far as being free or not in doing it). And it works for an audience as well; people can put themselves in those shoes, what if that happened to me? If this was from the perspective of, say, the character Patsy (Oscar winner Lupita Nyongo) then it would be too much for any audience outside of the those who could take relentless punishment. There may be some who watch the movie as it is and find it to be too much. Indeed the first time Solomon gets whipped is almost there, and is so harsh, to get the audience primed for what's to come. "This ain't no joke," is missing in subtitles on the bottom of the screen.This might make the movie sound too hammer-on-the-head about its message, but McQueen is a filmmaker in love with classical style. He doesn't cut too much, and every shot and length has its purpose. When he keeps a shot going for a while, like when the whipping of a particular character goes on for a while and to such a manic extent (including a pan to see the results) and it goes on for minutes, it's really about putting us there and the morality of it. If you cut, you lose the tension, you lose the realistic nature of what's going on in the drama. Adding to that the performers - and damn if Ejiofor, Fassbender, Nyongo and everyone else puts in their all, even in roles of limited screen time - are in those long takes and have to play all the emotions of these people, which are on land that once had slave plantations at that.It's nothing short of harrowing, and by the end (spoiler, not really since, again, Northrup wrote a best-selling book about his time in bondage) real tears can be shed when he reunites with his family because there's no false sentiment. This guy went through hell. And we're put there for the catharsis, and for how it relates to today. What do we do if we look away from racism and aggression and horrors across the world? Up on the noose it's about that situation, but it could be anyone at any time. That's the power of the art on display here."
"12 Years a Slave","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2024544/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt/","10"," 12 Years a Slave is quite a compelling depiction of slavery at its most harrowing ","Just watched this true story of slavery with my movie theatre-working friend. It depicts the abduction of Soloman Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor) from his family in New York State to the bayous of Louisiana (my home state) where he is made a slave. Director Steve McQueen does a fine job depicting how harrowing the experience is and provides catharsis when the ending comes. He also does a nice job of providing some background of other fellow slaves like that of the doomed Patsy. If anyone who paid to see this expected to watch Brad Pitt in a big role, they must have been disappointed to see him in only a couple of scenes but he does well in those and I have to assume most of the public was enthralled by the story to not even care by that point. Anyway, I highly recommend 12 Years a Slave if you want to be challenged as a viewer by the way someone is depicted as the main character is here. Oh, and nice shots of the Louisiana locations."

"12 Years a Slave" tells a story of hopelessness, fear, desolation and injustice. There are so many thought provoking quotes from the film such as "I don't want to survive, I want to live", these are so basic and yet powerful words. There are many powerful scenes, especially the very extended hanging scene - it's extraordinary that people could just walk past Solomon as if nothing happened. Such cold blooded behaviour is incompatible with humanity."12 Years a Slave" is a very powerful film. The use of silence and the sparing use of music augmented the emotions, giving viewers time to ponder on the atrocities of the past.

","An unflinching Steve McQueen directs this Oscar winning Best Motion Picture, based on the autobiography of Solomon Northup. A born free black man, Northup(Chiwetel Ejiofor), a skilled violinist was lured to the nation's capital in 1841 under the guise of work. He is duped and drugged and sold to a slave trader. Northup is forced to answer to another name and appear to be uneducated in order to survive the cruelty of a series of plantations in Louisiana for 12 years.His first owner, William Ford(Benedict Cumberbatch), was somewhat sympathetic and impressed by his new slave's limited intelligence and ability to play the fiddle. But Ford could not protect him from the cruelty of a sadistic overseer(Paul Dano). He is dangled for hours from a tree, while plantation life goes on all around him.Surviving, Northup is sent to another owner, Edwin Epps(Michael Fassbender), who egotistically spouts his own rendition of scripture supported by damaging whip lashes. Epps did not hide the fact he had sexual desires for a young slave, Patsy(Lupita Nyong'o); but his violent jealousy is trumped by his wife(Sarah Paulson), who has power of her own due to her personal wealth. A chance meeting with a Canadian abolitionist(Brad Pitt), will restore some dignity and hope, allowing Northup to end his extraordinary odyssey and return to his home in Saratoga, New York.Director McQueen will share various accolades with screenwriter John Ridley. Ejiofor truly owns the movie with his ability to convey despair, grit, determination, caution, pain and reserved dignity. And the lovely Miss Nyong'o will be honored with the Best Supporting Actress statue. Then there is Hans Zimmer's outstanding score. Also in the cast: Dwight Henry, Paul Giamatti, Alfre Woodard, Bryan Batt, Bill Camp and Christopher Berry. Be very aware of the R rating for violence, cruelty, nudity, disturbing images and brief sexual sequences. The 133 minutes running time is hardly noticed for this proves to be an impeccable viewing experience."
"12 Years a Slave","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2024544/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt/","10"," Provides A Brutal Look On The Evils Of Slavery ","Chiwetel Ejiofor stars in this movie entitled,"12 Years A Slave" as Solomon Northup, a New York State citizen who was kidnapped and made to work on a plantation as a slave in New Orleans in the 1800's. It was based on his memoir that has the same title of the movie and apparently it was stated that he worked for 12 years as a slave before he was released. This movie has been honored with numerous Oscar nominations that includes the screenplay written by John Ridley and its director Steve McQueen aside from that of Best Actor for Ejiofor and winning the Best Picture during the year it was released.Solomon Northup is a free African-American man working as a violinist, who lives with his wife, Anne Hampton, and two children in Saratoga Springs, New York.But in 1841,he was two men, Brown and Hamilton, offer him a two-week job as a musician if he will travel to Washington, D.C., with them. Once there, they drugged him and sold him as a slave to New Orleans along with others who have been captured. A slave trader named Freeman gives Northup the identity of "Platt", a runaway slave from Georgia and sells him to plantation owner William Ford. The movie presents the evils of slavery and the experiences Northup had in the next 12 years until he was released and regained his freedom.The film won the Best Picture as stated earlier in the review.It greatly deserves this honor as it marvelously and excellently provides a brutal look at the evils of slavery during its existence in American history.Also,it was unsentimental and it clearly portrays bluntly how slavery could affect an individual.This is a powerful and compelling that one would definitely appreciate as the viewer gets to see the horrific experiences of Northup and the other slaves during the 1800's. In summary,it provides credence and great cinema translation of Northup's memoir. It is a film that viewers of great movies that would surely enjoy."
"The Bucket List","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0825232/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt/","10"," Going in style. ","Two men, Edward (Jack Nicholson) and Carter (Morgan Freeman) are terminally ill from cancer. Both are essentially waiting to die. However, instead of just waiting for the inevitable, they come up with a plan...to create a bucket list AND do as much of it as they can before they can't. And, because Edward is mega-rich and has no family, he offers to take Carter along and include his list among the activities they'll do. But their globe-trotting adventure, while exciting, isn't quite as smooth as they'd planned. See the film and find out why.The main reason to watch this movie is to see the acting. After all, Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicholson are amazing actors and seeing them here is quite nice...and touching. The other reason is for the cinematography...the film is filled with gorgeous locations and looks simply incredible. And, of course, there's the story....which is touching and makes you think.This film is not an easy one to watch. For me, having been a cancer survivor, seeing how realistically it's portrayed in the film is a bit jarring....as Nicholson actually had his head shaved for this. It's also not going to be easy for anyone who's had someone close to them die from cancer...it's bound to bring back a lot of memories and pain. I mention all this because I think you should be aware of all this before you choose to see the film.. Now I am NOT saying you shouldn't...I'm just telling you to be prepared.By the way, I like the idea of a bucket list. But I also like the idea of NOT waiting until you are on death's door to do it like they did in the film. Do it as soon as you can....don't delay until you cannot complete your list. At age 50, I started....and have done an amazing number of once in a lifetime experiences. Don't wait too long."
"The Bucket List","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0825232/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt/","9"," Just wonderful ","I saw The Bucket List as I like Rob Reiner's movies a lot and I love Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman. Also because of the subject matter, which I think is something that a lot of cancer-sufferers or those who lost a family member or friend to it can relate to, having had a close friend(much older) who died four years ago after a very long illness I certainly did.I thought The Bucket List was wonderful. It isn't for me among Reiner's best not like Stand By Me, Misery and This is Spinal Tap, however it is nowhere near the disaster North was. The film is beautifully filmed and the scenery is striking. The soundtrack also adds to the poignancy, the film is exceptionally well written having some humorous moments as well as a number of genuinely touching ones without falling into the trap of cloying over-sentimentality.The story is well paced, without dragging too much or feeling too rushed, and is often very heartfelt. Reiner's direction is excellent, likewise with the performances of Nicholson and Freeman(they work so well together) and a surprisingly good performance from Sean Hayes(not that he's bad usually, I know him for comedy mostly and to see him have a more understated role than usual surprised me).Overall, a wonderful film that touched and warmed my heart. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
"The Bucket List","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0825232/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt/","8", Sad, Sad ","Bucket List, The (2007) * 1/2 (out of 4) Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman learn that they're both going to die of cancer so they set out on a trip to see and do everything they've wanted to in life. As I type this little review I've been out of the theater for about ten minutes and I must admit that my blood is boiling in anger. This is an incredibly bad, worthless, mean spirited and downright tasteless movie that really, really rubbed me the wrong way. The first forty-five minutes we see the two legends on screen bleeding, puking and slowly dying. Is this a good way to start a comedy? Seeing this stuff gets one in a rather depressed mood and at the same time we have childish acts going on, which are meant to make us laugh but all these jokes did was come off very distasteful to me. When the road trip/buddy picture starts the material was just weak and not very funny. We of course then come to the forced ending, which begs us to cry but by this point I was wanting out of the theater as quick as I could get out. This movie jerks the viewer around so much that it's rather shocking to see the talent involved. If it weren't for the two stars then i'd probably be ripping this film a lot more but I'll be respectful to them and say I hope this isn't their last film. Nicholson is all over the place and really delivers one of the worst performances I've seen from him since his pre fame era. Freeman seems to be sleepwalking through the role but I suspect both actors knew this material was weak and were doing whatever they could to try and save it. Freeman plays the wise, quiet guy and Nicholson goes over the top to try a milk any laugh that he can get out of the script. It just doesn't work. A really big misfire as far as I'm concerned."

Lo and behold he's forced to stay with working class mechanic Carter Chambers (Morgan Freeman) when he's diagnosed with cancer.Nicholson is playing to his strengths as the cavalier commanding boss. Freeman plays the sweet workingman with the brains of a professor. They bond over their difficult cancer treatments. When Cole is given 6 months, the pair escape to do their bucket lists.The veteran actors bring a history of living to these roles. Rob Reiner is able to wring out a couple of great performances from these geezers. They have great chemistry together. He's ying to his yang. The pontificating can get a little long winded, and the stories can be too sentimental. You got to go with it and accept the melodrama."
"The Bucket List","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0825232/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt/","9"," You Only Get One Chance ","As I get older, I realize that there is a limit to what I can do. I've done lots of traveling and had many experiences. For me, some superficial thing like skydiving is not in the cards. Let's face it. Do we have the endurance to go out like a bright candle in the wind? I liked the comment someone made earlier about the journey being more important than the result. The friendship between these two men, whether they accomplished all those bucket list things or not, is what the film is about. I also had trouble with the wife being left behind like so much baggage, and will have to think more about that. But as time draws to a close for the men, they gave it their best shot. Would that their best shot wasn't so much of the dramatic and more of the personal. Still, if you want to see a couple of pros really do their things, watch Freeman and Nicholson at their respective bests."
"The Bucket List","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0825232/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt/","5"," Maybe not one of the movies to watch before you die ","One of the criticisms of three time Oscar winner Jack Nicholson is that he always displays his Jack mannerisms in movies. Well he certainly lays it on thick here. You can have fun to see what bits Jack stole from one of his previous movies. When he fires a big gun and falls back is reminiscent from a similar scene in Batman. In fact Jack has a tattoo done which looks like his Joker.Nicholson plays a bad tempered, abrasive billionaire Edward Cole. A self made man who built a chain of hospitals with at least two people in a room philosophy. When he gets diagnosed of terminal cancer he shares a room in his own hospital with car mechanic and quiz enthusiast Carter Chambers (Morgan Freeman) who also has terminal cancer.In between the chemotherapy and the puking the two men bond and decide to go out on a high. They have a bucket list of things to do before they die.This is where it becomes handy that one of the characters is a billionaire to make the bucket list a reality. In real life you would not get affordable travel insurance to leave the country, never mind do dangerous stunts such as sky diving or speedcar racing when you have terminal cancer.Although the film is directed by Rob Reiner it is clear that both the stars did not even go to some of the exotic locations shown here such as the pyramids. It has all been green screened.Freeman lends the film his dulcet tones to provide the sentimental narration. The star power makes the film watchable even though it is all a bit daft and mawkish. After all Chambers abandons his wife and family to set off with a total stranger in the belief that he brings some peace, understanding and hope to Cole."

While the plot seems totally far fetched and Nicholson seems to have thrown some unnecessary vulgarity in there for the shear heck of it, the acting overcomes that as they grab your hearts. This is a two character story with only a few other characters thrown in as minor support (most notably Beverly Todd as Freeman's concerned wife), so as a "Buddy" movie, it works. Like the later day pairings of Matthau and Lemmon, it is a sentimental journey where two outstanding performers take center stage, whether climbing to the top of a pyramid, explore race car driving and sky diving, They hit the ignition heading towards death, enjoying every step of the way as they reach their final destination. Nicholson's humanity comes out in the conclusion in a realistic manner that shows the character's salvation and hidden humanity. But the quiet well-mannered dignity of Morgan's character is the outstanding performance and heart and soul of the film."

The contrast between the two lead characters offers very beautiful moments with witty and spirituous dialogs alternating with funny and dramatic scenes. This is one of those movies that bring happiness to the viewer in spite of the unpleasant theme illness and death. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Antes de Partir" ("Before Leaving")"

Furthermore let's say you've never heard of the two leading actors before and you don't know what you're in for exactly. If that is indeed the case, then you can call yourself lucky! You're gonna like this movie a lot more, just because of those facts ...Now to the others. The majority who actually do know Mr. Jack N. and Mr. Morgan F. Normally you can say, put those two in a movie and nothing can go wrong. Well indeed this movie does not stink (the lead actors alone are the guarantee for that), but it's not great either.While you can cheer the filmmakers for putting to older men in the lead(s) and counter the "let's cast the cover-magazine top model" thing that goes on, it's not enough to justify everything.Unfortunately the movie does not know, if it is a comedy or a drama. And that shows in many scenes. The fact that the trailer indicated it's more a comedy, doesn't help either.A shame then, because I liked the idea and I hoped and wished for something better. You can still watch the movie and be somewhat entertained, but with those "ingredients" you'll be excused if you thought it'd be a lot better!"

You put Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman together and the resulting picture is going to offer SOME kind of take away. I think they had their say here pretty effectively - we all have our dreams and aspirations, and the years fly by pretty quickly until one realizes that those same dreams fly by just as fast. Every once in a while it's not so bad to run up against one of those speed bumps in the middle of life to jog your consciousness about what really matters. If this picture is one of those speed bumps, that's not so bad. And seriously, without it, how would you ever have found out about Kopi Luwak?"

Well, I liked it. True, there's a predictable plot with the occasional treacly moment, but I liked how it portrayed these two men living their final months to the fullest by traveling around the world. Jack Nicholson always knows how to project just the right amount of sarcasm to make his role a cool one.OK, so maybe it is becoming a clich to have Morgan Freeman narrate movies, but this one does a good job showing how both his character and Nicholson's use the trip to eventually make peace with their families. Among other things, I could relate to the scenes where Freeman watches "Jeopardy!"; I also like to shout out the answers as I watch it.Overall, I would say that this is not a great movie - far from the best film of Nicholson, Freeman or Reiner - but that it goes to show that all three still have what it takes to create a worthwhile piece of cinema. I recommend it. And I now have a hankering to go to some of those places...although I'm not so sure about skydiving."
"The Bucket List","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0825232/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt/","5"," The Bucket List ","From director Rob Reiner (Stand by Me, When Harry Met Sally, Misery), this sounded like a quite bleak but at the same time quite an interesting comedy, and I certainly wanted to see the two lead stars together. Basically Carter Chambers (Morgan Freeman) is a great cultural intellect, married for forty-five years with wife Virginia (Beverly Todd), with two songs and one daughter, and he is placed in hospital being treated for terminal cancer. There he meets and shares his room with bitter billionaire Edward Cole (Jack Nicholson), who happens to own hospitals, he has had many divorces and has a missing daughter. In the days they spend in the hospital room together they get to know more about each other and become surprisingly close, and then Edward finds the list Carter threw in the bin. It is a "bucket list", everything he has ever wanted to do before he kicks the bucket, and seeing how Edward has been given at least six months to live, he suggests to Carter to actually do these things. So with the help of Edward's fortune, the pair travel the world to see the sights, sky dive, speed race in specific cars, and much more besides. For Carter though this list isn't all the enjoyable stuff to do before dying, it is finding closure and redemption, such as helping Edward's long lost daughter. Suddenly after a break-up by the two friends, Carter suffers a seizure and is rushed to hospital, with the cancer spreading to his brain, and he needs a possibly fatal operation, one that costs him his life. Edward carries out Carter's last wish to reconnect with the long lost daughter, and then he carries out his funeral before being cremated, and Edward's ashes join Carter's at the top of a snowy mountain, where the last item is crossed off of the bucket list. Also starring Sean Hayes as Thomas, Alfonso Freeman, Morgan's son as Roger Chambers, Rowena King as prostitute Angelica and Rob Morrow as Dr. Hollins. I can agree with the critics that this is filled with quite a lot of predictable moments, and the sentimental element is one of the most common things to expect, but with Nicholson and Freeman on screen together playing very engaging characters you can't go wrong. Good!"
"The Bucket List","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0825232/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt/","4"," Prepare Your Handkerchiefs. ","I missed the first part of this movie so these observations should be thought of as qualified. I'm only making them because the structure, the whole pattern of the movie is so familiar that I think I could have written the first half hour myself. Anyone could.Rob Reiner, the director, is nothing if not consistent. Probably his most effective movie -- not necessarily the most entertaining -- was "Misery." I loved the scenes of conflict between Kathy Bates and James Caan. Not so much the bit with the sledge hammer, although that was handled skillfully, but the scene in which Bates heaps her calumny on Caan for demanding ordinary typing paper instead of non-corrasable bond. "Anything ELSE, Mister MAN?" Loved it.But Reiner is a commercially oriented director. If his work has a stamp of originality it's his opposition to authoritarianism. But always, in the end, no matter how implausibly, the ending must be cathartic.Two older guys get their pink slips from the doctors. Jack Nicholson is a one-percenter, a take-charge guy who runs a business and has a turbulent past. He's reckless, almost to the point of being dangerous. Morgan Freeman is more ordinary, with a loving wife, naturally depressed at his impending doom.The two men get together and draw up a list of things they feel they should do before they kick it -- sky diving, etc. They escape from the hospital with Freeman tagging along a little reluctantly. Morgan Freeman is a superb actor and so is Nicholson, but their age has reduced them to these predictable roles. Freeman is no longer the savvy, menacing pimp of "Street Smart," but by now he's got the role of the moral friend down pat. And he handles it extremely well, as he did in the stupidly title "Se7en." Nicholson has clearly lost the oomph of his earlier days but can still pull off an emotional scene with panache.The ending, by the law of financial necessity, tugs are your heart strings. As in "Grumpy Old Men," which did well enough at the box office to generate a sequel, somebody must die. But not before a lengthy, heartfelt, and thoughtful speech to his companion. A lot of stuff about faith and religion -- but no PARTICULAR religion because we don't want to offend the Sufi Moslems in the audience. I mean, Holy Outhouse Mouse, what if the dying partner prattled on about converting to Judaism or becoming a Tibetan monk! Anyway, you can see why he has to die. He has to die so that the surviving partner can give the eulogy, drawing out the tear-laden ending even farther. I don't know how the writers missed the opportunity to have the second partner slowly expire (after a heart-warming peroration) so that somebody else could give still another eulogy. How about if the guy giving the SECOND eulogy were also to expire, so that another friend could give a THIRD eulogy? How about an unending iteration of eulogies? One of them at least ought to be good enough to put both Lincoln and Pericles to shame."
"The Bucket List","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0825232/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt/","1"," It feels too soon for either Nicholson or Freeman to bottom out in an old fogy comedy... ","Two cancer patients--a scabrous hospital tycoon and a low-keyed car mechanic with an encyclopedic mind--become friends while laid-up, later embarking on a personal journey together to try new things before death comes calling. Wanly-drawn 'serious comedy' with the buffoonish notion that skydiving and race car-driving are what dying men want to do in their last days. It's important to note that Jack Nicholson's character is exceedingly rich, and is willing to foot the bill for the trip, making any connection with reality a pipe-dream. This may, in fact, be one of Nicholson's very worst performances; he's still shouting at the top of his lungs, but this time only Morgan Freeman is listening. Freeman comes off better, and some of the early scenes have promise, but the whole thing collapses once the two men leave the hospital. Freeman's wife, the proverbial third-wheel, berates her husband for neglecting his family, and she has a point...practically the only point in evidence. * from ****"

"The Bucket List","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0825232/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt/","8", Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote. "," A fine story, and Nicholson and Freeman are superb. ","Update: I saw it again today, 18 months after my first viewing. The movie is almost as fresh, and I came away with an even better opinion of it. I went into this viewing a bit apprehensive, thinking that a movie about two men marking items off their "bucket list" wouldn't make much of a movie. I was very pleasantly surprised that it is much more than that, and a genuine look at "what is the meaning of life?" The two lead characters could hardly be more different. Jack Nicholson is super-rich but lonely Edward Cole. He buys hospitals and makes them run efficiently and for a profit. He was married 4 times. The problem was, he enjoyed being married, and he also enjoyed being single, and he could not enjoy both of them at the same time. Even in his advanced years he cannot turn down the opportunity for a quick romantic encounter.Morgan Freeman is mechanic Carter Chambers. But Carter is super intelligent and knows more things than just about anyone. He wanted to be a History Professor, but he put his ambitions on hold 45 years earlier when he found out that his wife was pregnant for their first son. They are still married, have a large extended family, and Carter kept working as a mechanic to support his family and allow his children to have a better life.When they both get sick about the same time, and are forced to share a hospital room, they become unlikely friends. Both are diagnosed with different, terminal illnesses, so Edward attempts to convince Carter that they need to achieve their "bucket list", things they wanted to do before they kick the bucket, a project Carter had initiated when he was a young man. As Edward says, "All I have is money, the cost doesn't mean anything to me, let's do it."Sean Hayes is good as Matthew, Edward's perfectly efficient personal assistant. But Edward always calls him "Thomas" because Matthew sounds too Biblical. Beverly Todd is good as Carter's wife Virginia. And, in a blast from the past, Rob Morrow (Dr. Joel in 'Northern Exposure') is Dr. Hollins, treating Edward.As the story unfolds and they travel the world in Edward's private Learjet, the two men begin to have an impact on the other, helping to realize important things about themselves and their lives. My personal "meaning of life" has always been "Be sure to give back more than you receive", and the message in this movie is consistent with that.In the end, Edward was able to cross off his list, "Kiss the most beautiful girl in the world." One of Carter's grown sons was played by Alfonso Freeman, who in fact is one of Morgan Freeman's grown sons. Aligned with the theme of this movie, Alfonso did not meet is father until he was in his 40s! SPOILERS: The "most beautiful girl" was his granddaughter whom he had never seen. Inspired by Carter, Edward looked up his estranged daughter and met his granddaughter in the process."
"The Bucket List","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0825232/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt/","6"," probably better than it has any right to be, mostly due to its star power ","The Bucket List only mildly calls into the A-list of Hollywood screenwriters Justin Zackham, and it only slightly elevates Rob Reiner as a director. He's had a slump as a director for what seems like the better part of fifteen years (oddly enough the last time the co-lead of this film, Jack Nicholson, appeared veraciously in A Few Good Men, was then) when before that he had one of the strongest careers of any Hollywood director. With the Bucket List he's made a film that's respectable, entertaining for its time being, and about as deep as a kiddie pool. It's nowhere near as bad as North or Rumor Has it, to be sure. But there could be some tweaking to the Zackham script, little things that could make it stand out just a bit more in dealing with aspects of the drama- what could be really dark and biting to level off with the cynical, jab-in-the-ribs sense of humor to it. What we're given, basically, is two old guys who are out to 'find themselves' in their time of dying. Ho-ho! OK, to be fair, it is a major credit to the stars that this even works as well as it does. One is an auto mechanic (Morgan Freeman) and the other a billionaire (Nicholson), and the two meet as sharing the same room, undergoing immense cancer treatments. Instead of undergoing "experimental" treatments after each finding out they'll be dead in at longest a year, Freeman's Carter has a hypothetical list of things he'd like to do before he dies. With Edward (Nicholson), he'll do it because, of course, Edward is wealthy enough to go the limit. It's interesting then to follow along these two figures for the simple fact that they are played by two of the best leading men of their generation. Strangely, however, if anyone could be said to have the edge over the other (all the more strangely because of how much I love the latter), Freeman did more with his part than Nicholson with his. This goes without saying Zackham doesn't reveal too much about Edward until late in the game, and only provides enough in the meantime for Jack to be "Jack" that we all know and love- perhaps, sad to say, too much so- while Freeman plays it touchingly, making the most out of a more well-rounded character with a few very good scenes (i.e. him at the bar in China).It should be way too schmaltzy to recommend, and if you do want the kind of studio movie-making that tries its absolute hardest to tug ever so hard at your heartstrings The Bucket List it certainly is that. But what offsets what could be a totally painful ordeal with such ideal stars. But Zackham, at the end of it all, does give enough fun lines and dialog exchanges and things for Nicholson and Freeman to do that one is distracted by the fact that Reiner as a director provides typical and dull imagery to the proceedings, only wisely enough giving the breathing room for the actors in some scenes. It's cheerful to see the bickering before sky-diving or the machismo flaring up during the car race, and it's insightful to see when the two just have a quieter scene like in front of the pyramids. It's a pithy romp about men being men dying of cancer. It's neither Nicholson or Freeman's best day as real masters of the acting craft.

What a joy seeing two veteran Oscar-winning pros, Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman, on screen together! Their characters, Ed Cole and Carter Chambers, are two middle-aged men who suffer cancer at approximately the same time and bond sharing a hospital room (at the building Cole owns). The movie picks up when they see the world together. Also loved Sean Hayes as Nicholson's assistant Thomas (actually Matthew but Jack's character thinks that's too biblical) and Beverly Todd as Freeman's wife, Virginia. Didn't recognize Rob Morrow as the doctor which is ironic since I watched him for years on "Northern Exposure"! Corny and maybe contrived in spots but for the most part this was a heartfelt and occasionally humorous movie. So on that note, I recommend Rob Reiner's The Bucket List. P.S. Alfonso Freeman, Morgan's son, plays his son here. And the grandson of legendary director Frank Capra, Frank Capra III, is a co-producer and first assistant director here."

Like Richie Cunningham, he was a character we were taught to like through weekly contact in a culturally suggestive context. Then he went out and made films, and at first they were spectacularly good. Not good in a dramatic or cinematic sense so much as the way in which they got the balance right with humor and storytelling. They don't have the same power now, but a couple of those films from the 80s were ripe, perfect gems.And then society folded itself into more complex ledges from which to look at itself, and Carl's son remained frozen where he was. In retrospect, he was frozen where his dad was. I can think of nothing more damning to say of a success.Well, he isn't a success any more. His notions about what's between real truth and ideal perspective are so far off, the effect is to remind us that society is crumbling. There really are people who cling to the thin notions this film builds on. Except there isn't much building; its straight out of the bottle.Its all tired. One good director too tired to learn the new world. One great actor who gave up long ago and now merely borrows from his past. Another actor who never had it, and admits that he is too lazy to do anything but be the same nice guy and narrate himself through a role. The story is a thin one: redemption.Freeman's character was almost written interestingly, his estrangement from his family a matter of unappreciated sacrifice. But its only written into the side. There's no real redemption here, because there are no real characters, only tired actors. Since we know they are not redeemed, cannot be, the project dies.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life."

The Bucket List is one such film. Its message is simple, its filming style equally so.

"A Beautiful Mind","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0268978/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt/","8"," Moving but overrated... ",""A Beautiful Mind" is a film about the mathematician John Nash. It is very cleverly written and directed, as about mid-way through the film you learn something very, very interesting about the film. I'd say more, but I don't want to ruin it--especially since the film makers did such a great job in presenting Nash's mental illness--something he's struggled with for many years.I enjoyed "A Beautiful Mind". It was a lovely semi-fictional biography of the life of a brilliant mathematician. But, as I just said, it's SEMI-fictional--meaning a lot of the film just never occurred and the story of the man's life was often sanitized. The result is a very uplifting film...but one that is also a bit phony. And, as a retired history teacher, I hate this about the film. Additionally, I think the 2002 Oscars was a rather poor year, as although the film did win the Best Picture award, the competition wasn't particularly strong. As a result of all these factors, I think the film is overrated. Does that mean you should not watch it? Certainly not. Just understand that Hollywood often gets it wrong--and they did here. And, incidentally, another thing that is just plain wrong was Russell Crowe's accent. I don't know where he was supposed to be from, but it was no where near West Virginia."
"A Beautiful Mind","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0268978/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt/","7"," Admirable and extremely well made, if just missing the mark of a "great" film ","'A Beautiful Mind' had a lot going for it. An intriguing story based on an interesting man, a great cast full of talented actors, the involvement of James Horner and Roger Deakins (perhaps one of the best modern cinematographers in the business) and Ron Howard as director (a very competent director with some great films under his belt, directing always with a lot of quality and polish if not always distinction).Finally seeing it, always wanting to but never quite having the time, 'A Beautiful Mind' was to me a good, often very good, film, if not quite great. Of its four Oscar wins, Connelly and adapted screenplay (on the most part) were worthy wins, though there were better contenders in the Best Picture and Director categories, 'Fellowship of the Ring' for Best Picture and David Lynch for 'Mulholland Drive' for director. Again, from personal opinion, 'A Beautiful Mind's' Oscar nominations were worthier of wins generally, especially Russell Crowe for Best Picture, make-up and the film editing, cinematography also should have been under serious consideration.There are a few things that stop 'A Beautiful Mind' from being great. Pacing can be messy, feeling rushed in some spots and then dragging in others. Admittedly though there were other places where it was perfect.Do agree with the portrayal of schizophrenia being problematic, it is a sensitive and courageous subject to address but those with schizophrenia and mental illness in general will find problems with how it's portrayed. It is a complex and often frightening illness, that the film tries to take seriously and sensitively, but it just felt too clean and like it was being careful not to offend but ended up being too careful. Other aspects are heavy-handed.The espionage subplot was intriguing mostly and gave some powerful conflict, at the same time parts not quite gelling with the rest of the film and feeling a little confused.However, 'A Beautiful Mind' for want of a better word looks absolutely beautiful. The cinematography with the vibrant colours and seamless fluidity was one of the best of its year, and the period detail remarkably evocative and a joy to look at. James Horner's score has garnered mixed views, mostly leaning on the positive, personally though it added a lot to the emotional power of the film, swelled thrillingly and was beautifully and cleverly orchestrated, didn't think it was melodramatic at all.'A Beautiful Mind's' adapted screenplay really makes one think while also capturing a wide range of emotions, more than making up for the lack of accuracy. The story is compelling on the most part with a spot on portrayal of mathematics, something that was praised by the maths community at the time including John Nash. It is very moving and uplifting, many scenes dealt with powerfully.Ron Howard's direction is some of the best he's done. As ever from him it is rich in quality and polish but it also is some of his most distinguished and shows that he can direct with distinction (even if he doesn't always elsewhere.Can't praise the cast enough, along with the visuals it is the best aspect of the film. It is impossible to find fault with the powerhouse and perhaps career best performance of Russell Crowe, while Jennifer Connelly is touching in a loyal and sympathetically written role (even if not as challenging as a few of her other roles such as in 'Requiem for a Dream'.Ed Harris is chillingly malevolent, while the rarely less than game Paul Bettany and Adam Goldberg charm and Judd Hirsch and Christopher Plummer also not putting a foot wrong.In conclusion, admirable and extremely well made, directed and acted with a sizeable range of emotions, if missing the mark of being a "great" film instead of a good and often very good film and not doing enough justice to a great man and his life. The divisiveness is understandable. 7/10 Bethany Cox"
"A Beautiful Mind","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0268978/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt/","6"," An interesting portrayal ","An interesting real-life biopic of mathematic genius John Nash, a man who won the Nobel prize but whose genius cost him his sanity. This is handled in a mature and sensitive way by Ron Howard, although it does veer into sentimentality in the typical Hollywood way and it does have a maudlin feel to it at times. Nash's story is an engaging one and he's certainly an interesting figure, tragic in many respects; Russell Crowe's casting is miles away from the macho persona he's best known for but he's surprisingly sensitive in the part. My favourite element is the handling of Nash's mental health issues, which are portrayed in an exciting, thriller-like way."
"A Beautiful Mind","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0268978/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt/","8"," Russell Crowe proves his acting versatility ","This movie starts in 1947 Princeton where John Nash (Russell Crowe) is trying to start his career. He is not impressed with anybody else there, and searches for an original idea. He is awkward and very peculiar. Then one night at a bar, a tall blonde and her friends walk in. It gives him an idea to overturn Adam Smith's theory. This allows him a placement in the Wheeler Labs in MIT. Years later working at MIT, he meets student Alicia (Jennifer Connelly) who would eventually become his wife, and the mysterious William Parcher (Ed Harris) from the DOD.Russell Crowe has been a leading man for awhile but this one proves once and for all his versatility. He is amazing throughout giving a praise worthy performance. Jennifer Connelly makes a great entrance as she shows her brains as well as her beauty. Director Ron Howard is spot on with this movie. He allows Crowe the space to lead. It's a very human character. It's the best picture Oscar winner for a good reason."
"A Beautiful Mind","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0268978/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt/","9"," A great character study. ","Ron Howard is certainly a prize. There is such a danger when one plays with the audience's sense of reality, that things will become so confusing as to destroy any consistent engagement. The story of John Nash is remarkable. First of all, we have this brilliant man, this genius. He carries on daily discourse and is a success in every endeavor. However, underlying everything is the hallucinatory world of his disease. How do you respond to the correct reality when there are so many. How do you go on when you know that some of the people you speak with aren't real; that some of the issues dominating your life are objects of paranoia and fear. Howard and Crowe pull this off in full view of the audience. When the movie is over, we understand. Then there is the fact that there are people who wake up every morning and face the type of day that this man does. If he were a raving lunatic it would be one thing. But he continues to make his way through life. Those around him are constantly off balance because they have to recognize that what he says may have not foundation. You look for the evidence, not the word. The direction takes us on a journey that hasn't been done before."
"A Beautiful Mind","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0268978/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt/","4"," Number crunching ","I first watched this film when it had an advanced preview before its wide release. I liked the film but it did not feel it was a Best Picture Oscar winner and I believe screenwriter Akiva Goldsman is a hack of the worst kind. Well he did write Batman & Robin and here explains 'Game Theory' in terms of picking women up at bars which should had been enough to disqualify him for an Oscar win.Over the years the film's disparity with actual true events has been an issue with a lot of people. The trouble is nearly all films tend to be fictionalised for dramatic effect and A Beautiful Mind I guess is no better or worse but to me felt like a film loosely based on some true facts.I recently re-watched the film and planned to review it. The death of John and Alicia Nash in a traffic accident focused my mind on the review.What I took away from my reviewing of A Beautiful Mind was Nash as played by Russell Crowe being surprised by the varied use of the Game Theory principles in the world of commerce. It makes the hackneyed attempt to explain this theory by Goldsman make it look even more inept. I actually find myself thinking of how Game Theory applies in real life with things like sport rights television auctions.Once upon a time one channel would buy up exclusive rights to soccer. A winner take all attitude which presumably led to underhand tactics such as bribery.Now you have packages sold to various TV channels, which means several channels in one country will show live soccer at different times and days with another channel having highlights and the soccer authorities maximising their revenue. The poor punter gets even more poorer though having to pay more in subscription payments!On the weekend that Nash died I even thought if Game Theory could apply in things like peace talks. Were the South African Truth and Reconciliation hearings just another application of Game Theory put in practice?A Beautiful Mind kind of overlooks the most important part Nash work and really places it as a footnote.What we have is Russell Crowe playing the most muscular, dull/shy Ivy league mathematician you will ever get to meet in a film whose depiction of mental illness borrows heavily from the hit movie released several years earlier, The Sixth Sense.You kind of lulled into a false sense of security before you are hit in the gut with a sucker punch, but eh, this is a film of a man who suffered from mental illness. I saw the punch coming.You then see Nash regaining his self, his worth and his wife. He returns to academia and gains academic acceptance with a Noble prize.The film is watchable, there are some nice flourishes put in by Ron Howard the director but it feels less substantial than its critical acclaim suggests which includes an Oscar for best picture.A Beautiful Mind is a picture of a man where they give you the biography but miss out on his thinking."
"A Beautiful Mind","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0268978/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt/","8", Not perfect but a typically polished and professional story that is well told ","As a young man, John Nash is antisocial, arrogant but quite the mathematical genius. After months of failing to live up to expectation due to focusing on trying to find formula within the mundane. However a major finding brings him to the attention of the Government and sees him set up within a secretive department looking to crack the code that will lead them to a Russian bomb hidden somewhere within the US. Starting as just a series of problems, John's involvement deepens as the Russians move to stop the code breakers and only John's handler Parcher can protect him. Meanwhile the secrets start to affect John's personal life.Despite all the hype and awards I didn't feel that fussed about seeing this film and just decided to wait for television to bring it to me for free. Having finally seen it I must admit that, while not being anything brilliant, it is certainly a very professional and engaging product despite some big flaws. The story is based on reality (if you pardon the irony of that) and it doesn't matter too much if it skims over some issues and omits some very well-publicised aspects of Nash's life. The story is well written and is the better for focusing on the confusion within Nash between reality and imagined because it does help move the film forward all the time. Conversely the weakest moments are in the rather mawkish and sentimental moments within reality fortunately these are not that often and generally the film moves forward well and I did find myself quite engaged by it.Howard's direction is up to his usual standard, by which I mean that it is polished and professional even if it does lack anything in the way of flair or unique talent. Crowe is very strong though. Much better than the ego and the headlines would suggest, here he delivers a performance that convincingly changes across the film and does the tricky thing of making the audience feel and understand a character in a way that was very difficult to pull off. Connelly is nearly as strong in a smaller role and Ed Harris has fun with a powerful character who noticeably lifts the pace when he is on screen. Bettany is his usual self and good value for it and support is generally good from Plummer, Lucas, Goldberg and a few others.Overall a very polished drama but one that is engaging for the majority. The pace is generally good despite sometimes being a bit too sentimental and laboured, and the delivery generally pulls off the difficult task of putting us into Nash's world and allowing us to feel for him and understand him."
"A Beautiful Mind","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0268978/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt/","8"," "I can work it all out. All I need is time." ","You'll recall the scene in the movie when John Nash (Russell Crowe) is given an initial tour of Wheeler Labs, and he questions the presence of Big Brother watching from an elevated catwalk above the main floor. A hint to the viewer that what Nash is experiencing occurs later in the picture when William Parcher (Ed Harris) meets Nash for the first time, and refers to himself as 'Big Brother'. If in fact Parcher was a real person, it's doubtful that anyone at Wheeler would have revealed Nash's observation to him. That's what struck me the first time I saw this film and then again when I watched it once more this morning.Well, like a lot of movies based on a true story that I initially find compelling and worthy of the highest rating here on IMDb, I'm left frustratingly disappointed that the screenplay distorts the facts in order to give the most appealing impression possible to the viewer. The main one here was Nash's relationship with wife Alicia, portrayed by Jennifer Connelly. Their first marriage only survived for three years before his schizophrenia drove them apart, resentful over the fact that she had him involuntarily committed. Their romantic relationship then rekindled after he won the Nobel Prize, and well after his mental illness had subsided.What I liked about Crowe's portrayal of Nash was the way he came to grips with his delusions and later treated them with a dose of good humor - "There's no point in being nuts if you can't have a little fun" is what he stated to his friend Sol (Adam Goldberg) when he came to visit. Later on, reinstated as a teaching professor at Princeton, he self assuredly asked a student to verify the presence of a 'new person' he hadn't seen before. Those subtle instances helped reestablish Nash as someone who recognized that he was mentally ill, and that he needed to control his health with the proper medication.For anyone dealing with mental illness within their own family, I think this film can be an eye opener about the fear and hopelessness that the sick person experiences. I state that from a personal perspective having observed now adult children going through the pain and embarrassment of delusional fantasies that at times became downright scary. In that regard, the movie presents a reasonable perspective that illnesses like schizophrenia can be treated with the proper attention, a dedicated medical provider, and the correctly prescribed medication. I've seen it happen more than once."
"A Beautiful Mind","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0268978/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt/","7"," Russell Crowe Can Act? ","After a brilliant but asocial mathematician (Russell Crowe) accepts secret work in cryptography, his life takes a turn for the nightmarish.I was sold when Nash began expounding on Adam Smith, and how everyone acting in their own self-interest works best for all. Effectively, he made a good argument for price fixing... only applied to dating. His thoughts on game theory are pretty incredible.The story gets more interesting as Nash gets more mentally ill. It is in many ways a precursor to "The Imitation Game" (2014), and both are excellent films about mathematicians. Maybe not a great double feature, but excellent for comparison."
"A Beautiful Mind","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0268978/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt/","8"," a beautiful movie ","Prior to "A Beautiful Mind" coming out, I had never heard of John Nash. Then, this movie blew me away. While most critics panned it, the viewer gets completely absorbed by every performance. Russell Crowe does an excellent job as Nash, starting out with his days as a student at Princeton. As the movie progresses, we see his schizophrenia evolve. His wife Alicia (Jennifer Connelly) is virtually the only person who can understand him."A Beautiful Mind" is one of those movies where you are surprised as you learn various things about the characters. Also, maybe the movie's timing might have helped it. After September 11, 2001, we needed something to show us that human nature is not inherently evil. This movie, released a few months later, did a great job reminding us of that. All in all, I consider it very appropriate that this movie finally got Ron Howard a Best Picture winner (plus a Best Director Oscar). Never preachy or sappy, "A Beautiful Mind" is a beautiful movie, and Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly probably played their best roles ever."
"A Beautiful Mind","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0268978/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt/","6"," A Beautiful Mind ","First time I saw the film I thought it was brilliant, seeing it a second time I can understand reasons the critics give it three stars, but it is still very enjoyable, from Oscar winning, and BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated director Ron Howard (Splash, The Da Vinci Code). Basically, John Nash (BAFTA winning, and Oscar nominated Russell Crowe, he lost to Denzel Washington in Training Day) is a maths genius at Prinecton University who can solve complicated equations, codes and theories. He can't find good use for his skills, so he becomes a teacher, and he falls for one of his students, Alicia Nash (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Jennifer Connelly), who he also marries and has a child with. He is met by William Parcher (Ed Harris) who gets him working for the government breaking Soviet codes and getting involved in a big conspiracy plot. Alicia becomes concerned for John though and calls Dr. Rosen (Christopher Plummer) to have a talk with him, and that is when we the audience, and soon John himself, realises he has paranoid schizophrenia. So John knows that Parcher, his university roommate Charles Herman (Paul Bettany) and his niece are all unreal people who only he can see, and he really struggles to get on with them in his life, causing terrible distress for Alicia. As the years go by he has learnt to ignore them, he returns to Princeton, and his academic success wins him the Nobel Prize for economics. Also starring Adam Goldberg as Sol, Judd Hirsch as Helinger, Josh Lucas as Hansen, Anthony Rapp as Bender and Austin Pendleton as Thomas King. Crowe does very well as the lead character, Connelly of course steals the show with her award-winning performance, and the support of Harris and Bettany are good, it is a film that desires people to take it seriously, but still very worthwhile. It won the Oscars for Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published, and Best Picture, and it was nominated for Best Editing, Best Makeup, Best Music, Original Score for James Horner, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Film, and it won the Golden Globes for Best Screenplay, and Best Motion Picture - Drama, and it was nominated for Best Original Score. Russell Crowe was number 26 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Paul Bettany was number 40 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, and the film was number 93 on 100 Years, 100 Cheers. Good!"
"A Beautiful Mind","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0268978/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt/","9"," Crowe Does It Again! ","The more I watch Russell Crowe, the more I am becoming a big fan of his acting talent. Here again, he demonstrates his skills in a role that had me spellbound. Of course, mentally-ill people are usually fascinating. Look how popular the cable television show "Monk" has become.Crowe's character, mathematician John Nash, is not nearly as eccentric as "Monk," but his schizophrenia makes for a fascinating portrait of a very troubled man. This is another of those Ron Howard based-on-a-true-story films, so don't take everything here as gospel truth....because it ain't so. (One example: in real life, Nash's wife was anything but as supportive as Jennifer Connelly was portrayed here.)The first time I saw this film I was disappointed. Maybe I expected more, maybe I felt the story was unfair to the viewer and I felt like this was just one more attempt at Liberal Hollywood to make fun of those in the 1950s who were opposed to Communism. Well, on the second viewing, just a few weeks ago, I didn't have a problem with any of those things, just enjoying the performances and the classy-looking cinematography, thanks to one of the best cameramen in the business, Roger Deakins. I'm not always a fan of director Ron Howard, but his films are usually interesting and pleasing to the eye. He and Crowe seem to be a good pair, too, as witnessed by 2005's "Cinderella Man."For those who enjoy a cerebral thriller, this is a very intriguing film. Ed Harris, Paul Bettany, Adam Goldberg, Judd Hirsch, Josh Lucas and Anthony Rapp all deliver solid supporting help and, if you haven't seen this, this story will deliver a big surprise. If you know the ending, a second viewing is even more interesting as you trace Nash's actions from the beginning."
"A Beautiful Mind","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0268978/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt/","6"," Not bad ","For generations people on the street have believed that "genius is linked to insanity" and for generations psychiatrists have denied that there was any connection. John Nash is one of the reasons the belief is popular. He suffered from paranoid schizophrenia. Unlike major mood disorders (depression, mania) it tends not to come and go -- just to come and hang around. It's a devastating disease, affecting as it does the very organ that makes us what we are. And the side effects of treatment are not to be lightly dismissed.John Nash was a very lucky guy. His search for patterns is rather typical, but his finding REAL ones, that is patterns that exist outside his own mind, is unusual. The surprising thing about his case is not that he recovered but that over the years he managed to climb out of the abyss and find a position with which he felt comfortable. Insofar as this is a success story, it's pretty unusual.Ron Howard belongs to a group of relatively young directors -- Penny Marshall, James Brooks, Rob Reiner are some others -- that tend to take on stories that aren't excessively demanding or quirky. There may be troubles, but the endings are uplifting or heartwarming. This is that kind of story. It follows the trajectory we associate with sports biographies. Hero shows early promise, is struck down by demons during his career, overcomes demons and is apotheosized. That's pretty much the case here. Nash's winning the Nobel is kind of like Redford hitting that final game-saving home run in "The Natural." Like Einstein, Nash was awarded the prize for work he'd done earlier in his life. Math and physics are tricky fields. If you haven't made it by the time you're thirty, you're out of the game.But if the story isn't especially uncommon some other things about the movie are. The integration of Nash's hallucinations with his "real" experiences. This is always tough to do on screen. The fantasy figures in "I Never Promised You a Rose Garden" are both frighteningly unreal and obvious. But here the viewer doesn't find out until the movie is half over that some of the characters he's gotten to know are productions of Nash's mind. And they're warm and comforting too, we can can understand their appeal. Once or twice they are a bit "overlogical" too. When his wife is trying to leave him, Nash hallucinates a little girl he'd first seen years ago, realizes that she hasn't grown any older, and that she therefore isn't real. Hallucinations don't work in such a reasonable manner. That's the kind of insight that a screenwriter might dream up. The movie also is a bit weak in conveying the kind of deterioration in personal care that accompanies schizophrenia. Most patients aren't pretty. They are suffering and it shows in their bad teeth, their mismatched clothes, and carelessly groomed hair.Still, within these limits, the movie is pretty good, the acting especially. It's easy to gain praise for playing the role of a deviant. You can win awards for it (cf., "Charlie," "Rain Man," et al.) But for the first time, Russell Crowe does a fine job of suggesting a genuine personality behind that dimly comprehending physical bulk. He actually comes up with a real performance as the young Nash. And it only improves as he gets older. One of the long-term effects of antipsychotic drugs is a set of twitchy movements called tardive dyskinesia. A good example of this is given after his return to Princeton, when he waddles along the campus and some kids mimic him from behind and laugh. (Ron Howard had the good taste not to turn incidents like this into moments of heartbreaking, tearjerking, hankywetting, blubbering, lachrymos pathos. Some directors would have done exactly that.)There is also the case of Jennifer Connoly. (Wow.) She's hardly recognizable as the innocent, open-lipped waif that she was in, say, "Hot Spot." She's a full-blown woman now, her face filled out and her jaw somewhat hardened, although she has the same girlish voice. Like Brooke Shields she has changed over the years from an adolescent of Kewpie-doll beauty whom any normal man would want to squeeze and bite into a more mature but still strikingly beautiful creature. It's hard to tell whether she is much of an actress. She hasn't had any truly challenging roles. Her movements are languid. They flow like silk. That could be a limitation.Well, see this movie. You may think you've had it bad, but Nash had it worse. For most of us, alas, there is not much of a Prize at the end."
"A Beautiful Mind","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0268978/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt/","7"," Though designed to be prestigious, the beauty does manage to come through ","Academy Award winner for Best Picture begins at Princeton, 1947, where mathematician John Nash (played by Russell Crowe) is flailing away at an economics theory while all his male classmates just want to get laid (the film equates the average Princeton male to the type of guys usually found on TV's "Happy Days"). Five years later, Nash is working with the Pentagon on numerical formation patterns and appears to be pulled into a conspiracy plot to thwart the Russians from detonating their H-Bomb on American soil. It isn't surprising that "A Beautiful Mind" won the Oscar; it has been designed specifically for prestige (i.e., awards). However, it's a sentimental, dramatic package which gives its time-worn movie theme--mental illness--a few new twists courtesy screenwriter Akiva Goldsman, adapting Sylvia Nasar's biography of John Forbes Nash Jr. (the Academy normally frowns upon edgy concepts, yet this one has an old-fashioned set-up, which they welcome, plus a lead performance preconceived to be a triumph). After a rocky first hour, the picture does improve. Howard methodically sets up the plot mechanisms, but gives us a fascinating main character who is disconnected, a failure at social interaction, and a really bad first date. Nash's future-wife (Jennifer Connelly) isn't particularly intriguing or enchanting (she has dim thoughts, such as "God must be a painter, why else would there be so many colors?"). Still, by the second act, Nash's personal crisis has become more clear to us, more involving and gripping, and Crowe isn't so much deliberately one-note as he is intensely focused (the actorly tics come later...and, when they do, they are almost endearing). The film has that slick look of "grand entertainment" that makes critics bow their heads, yet there are indeed miraculous moments: Nash neglecting to take his medicine and discovering an entire covert operation going down in his backyard shed; Nash, recuperating, riding his bicycle in an infinity pattern, scribbling numbers in the air with his finger. The mental institution stuff is the cinematic equivalent of treading water (and wastes Christopher Plummer as a doctor), but the last half of the film is quite good: a brilliant but disturbed professor working his damnedest to overcome his demons, helped along by a loving woman and receiving the kind of respect he never dreamed of. Howard isn't always graceful or sensitive (especially in the electric shock sequence), but he does resurrect a tired genre and ultimately makes it a moving experience. *** from ****"
"A Beautiful Mind","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0268978/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt/","8", Wonderful and classy film, a must-see on DVD, in my book a "10". ","First I want to comment on some of the unworthy criticism regarding the "accuracy" of this film. The writer and director state plainly that this is a semi-fictional story using the essential "architecture" of mathematician John Nash's life, namely his genius, his schizophrenia, his relationship with Alicia, and his winning the Nobel prize. It was NOT intended to be a complete biographical sketch. Plus, since much of Nash's work with the government was top-secret, all that had to be fabricated for the film. As were many of the characters, the delusions, the code-breaking simulations, the speech upon receiving the award. They sought to take a very captivation story of a genius who overcame a debilitating illness, with the help of a special companion, to survive and win a most high honor, and they have done it very well. It deserves "Best Picture" and Opie (I mean, Ron Howard) deserves "Best Director." Second, I want to comment about the acting. Russell Crowe, as difficult as he may be at times in public, is THE consummate actor working today. Just to see what he does with this role of John Nash, to see how he captures the character, how he evolves as the film unfolds, is worth a viewing all on its own. Without getting into the politics of The Academy, nor criticizing anyone else's performance, Russell Crow deserves "Best Actor" for his role in "A Beautiful Mind." As well as he is regarded, I still think his work is under-appreciated by most. I found myself forgetting that I was seeing an actor, that's how good he is, and that seldom happens with me. All the others are good in this film, but Crowe is the sole reason for its greatness.And third, anyone still watching movies like this at home on VHS are missing so much. This DVD, two disks actually, is one of the very best I have seen. Not only are the sound and picture just perfect, disk one allows you to play the film with either the director's or the writer's commentary. Both are among the most interesting of any commentaries, adding real value to understanding some of the finer points of the film. After I saw the whole film, I went back and re-played certain scenes with each commentary turned on, and essentially doubled my enjoyment of the whole movie.Disk one also has some production notes and deleted scenes which are interesting. But disk two has a wealth of extras for those who like to study the whole creative process of movie-making. Included are the choice of the writer, a taped interview with John Nash where he tries to explain his prize-winning theory to Ron Howard. Scoring, special effects, etc, the whole process. I own the DVD."
"A Beautiful Mind","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0268978/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt/","8"," A Splendid job turned in by Crowe and Howard ","Ron Howard brings forth one of his best and most serious films to date, A Beautiful Mind. It examines a mathematical wizard named John Forbes Nash Jr. who created a discovery in game theory that is still used today for a number of things. But the film isn't so much about math (what film is?) as it is about the man's struggles with a disease in his mind that drives him to madness yet somehow is able to try and fight it to the best of his abilities, which aren't always as high as they could be. This man is played by Russell Crowe who gives another top shelve performance to add with The Insider, L.A. Confidential and Romper Stomper (Gladiator I don't really count as a top shelve performance), and he plays Mr. Nash so well it doesn't need to be thought that he's immitating him as much as being him. Crowe's Nash starts off in the film at Princeton university where he wants to distinguish himself with an original idea and soon comes up with one that defies 150 years of mathematical practice. Things look good, especially since he starts dating a graduate student (Jennifer Connelly in an Oscar caliber performance to be sure) who is smitten with him. But then things start to get troublesome- Nash is asked by a member of the defense depot to break codes that could be in newspapers, magazines, etc to help out the government. Soon he feels paranoid the Russians are after him, and this leads him into a mental hospital (under Christopher Plummer's care) where he learns the entire consipracy is in his head (schitzophrenia). Then the plot thickens as Nash battles with his disease, medication or not.Sometimes it's almost too much, but Howard delivers overall a great and compelling tale throughout nevertheless and Crowe shines (the rest of the cast, real or not, are also quite credible) with all the talent he has. Grade: A+ or A."

Played admirably by Russell Crowe, this guy really has some serious hangups.Married to his former student,played by supporting actress Oscar winner Jennifer Connelly, the professor goes through some rough stages, and even as the movie ends there are still problems with his mental condition.Crowe is absolutely phenomenal. His poor off screen behavior led to his losing this Oscar.The film conveniently doesn't mention that Nash had a history of anti-semitism.

"A Beautiful Mind","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0268978/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt/","8"," You Do the Math ","By the time Russell Crowe (as John Nash) married Jennifer Connelly (as Alicia), I had serious concerns about "A Beautiful Mind". My first question revolved around Mr. Crowe's Princeton roommate, Paul Bettany (as Charles). I could not understand why Mr. Bettany did not pal around with the college bar crowd. Crowe was there, with a group of other students, but no mixing with Bettany. Why? Obviously, Bettany loved to imbibe; so, he should have been the life of the party, I thought. With that question nagging me, I continued to have questions. Like was up with the two men at the later party? I wondered Then, the final straw - Crowe uses his secret "code" to open a security gate; and, the gate swings open without closing behind him. This was not a very secure gate. Anyone wanting to gain admittance would only have to wait for Crowe to open it up, and walk in after him (if not climb in ahead of him). And, why wasn't Bettany at the Crowe's wedding? Just when I was wondering how to get in touch with director Ron Howard, the truth dawned on me. I was expecting a more traditional film. A couple of surreal moments should have tipped me off; for example, Crowe's barroom deduction concerning the students' chances of "picking up" a blonde women. Still, I didn't fully appreciate what was going on. Was the rollicking car chase with Ed Harris (as Parcher) supposed to be an illusion? Then, I wondered about the characters "Charles" and "Marcee". I understood "Parcher" as a manifestation of "cold war" paranoia. But, I do not understand what, precisely, "Charles" and "Marcee" reveal about the title character, other than a propensity for creating illusions. The three imaginary characters are the most important in Nash's life - maybe if I knew what they were around for, they'd go away. Eventually, the film confirms suspicions. I can almost see clearly now.******** A Beautiful Mind (2001) Ron Howard ~ Russell Crowe, Jennifer Connelly, Paul Bettany"

"A Beautiful Mind","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0268978/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt/","8", Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote. "," Not Beautifully Mined ","Spoilers herein.So frustrating. Once again we have an inept film about mathematics. Hard to understand: film is visceral, drawing from visually-based insights as abstractions of reality. That also describes the most exciting kind of mathematics.The magic of the Lord of the Rings books wasn't in the story, but in the creation of an alternative world, complete with cosmology. The film lacks that inner reality and instead focuses on the story, basically one escape after another. But it is rousing good fun on that level. And so we have here. As with `Lord,' `Mind' knows where all the emotional strings are and pulls enough of them in the right order that we get successfully manipulated. But this film misses the opportunity of a lifetime to merge the images of math and film.There are three good opportunities here, all missed:The Nash Story Part 1: Mathematics is a matter of invention more than discovery. A clever mathematician can shape abstractions that influence all thought that follows. It is as close to God as one can get, and since most of the world is imaginary, one can argue that God will be bested at some point -- if it hasn't already occurred. There are conflicting factors involved: you need to be novel, but it must bind to some part of the world that exists. The unfamiliar made familiar; which can be done through `proofs' which is a way of presenting the new in such a way that everyone believes the world was made that way all along.Which means you have to be extraordinarily clever in approaching a problem from an odd angle and finding the linkage. Nash was the best mind of the century in this first (challenging both Einstein and Von Neumann!). That's saying a whole lot. It means you have to have an intense focus that you maintain uninterrupted for months. The very idea exhausts. Nash had this in spades, perhaps his most remarkable quality because it was something he taught himself to do. Finally, mathematics is a verbal art, constructed in narratives with colleagues, not intrinsically in funny symbols as cartoons and movies would have it.So think of this: you must talk with peers using a common vocabulary; but you must not in order to stay important and novel. You must shape the new in small terms, but have a global focus, holding mental orgasms for months. The tension between reaching far into the cosmos and keeping it in a conversation must have been immense. The book on which this film is based focuses on the social devolution of Nash, but the more interesting side is where his unanchored voyages took him. The film didn't mine this lode. In reality, Nash was not incompetent with soliciting sex: in fact he was very smooth and conducted multiple simultaneous bisexual affairs. That was part of the focused exercise to relate to the `world as-is.' Where he was incompetent was in mapping his visions to our lesser reality.The Nash Story 2: Nash's madness was almost certainly caused by his `breaking' his mind by straying too far from reality to get outside this large problem he was working. The conspiracies came not from cold war silliness but something far deeper: Phil Dick science fiction and Kabbalah. Not stupid numbers but topologies (forms). Not codes but manifold patterns in higher spaces. Literally extraterrestrial voices. By the way: Alicia was as crazy, but I suppose since she had an uninteresting mind, it is not worth watching.The most powerful scene (in the book at least) is when Nash and poet Robert Lowell were in the same `hospital.' Lowell entered Nash's room and mind daily and held forth on both for visitors. `Every word was his best friend.' Quite possibly the century's most imaginative and literate minds melded. I would have loved to have been there. (In fact I was in a thin way. I took the class Nash taught right after he was first committed -- his acolyte emulated his manner.)The Nash Story 3 is the story about the Nobel. Uncle Alfie didn't like mathematicians (read `Jews') so refused to establish a prize in math. The `economics' was an independent prize grafted onto the Nobels as an `almost' Nobel. Most scientists are uncomfortable with economics being treated like physics because it is more obviously a constructed reality. Nash's prize prompted a debate within the Nobel community that destroyed the economics prize and is eating away at whether there is anything left but math when you skim more than superficially. It is one of the most profound institutional self-examinations ever. The film didn't mine this lode either.All missed opportunities. Wouldn't you like to have been transported rather than merely made to cry?What we get instead is a powerful actor and a competent director. Crowe's trick is to project his character not only into the space around him but into the space of the following scene -- largely by physical motion, usually involving the forehead. Good. But the mannerisms are not those of a mathematician in the Wiener tradition. The accent is not accurate, just an excuse to give new rhythms to the bland lines. The effect of the madness is not true, reflecting prior movies more than reality.Howard's directing is completely without risk, art, interest. The one effect he tries is a bunch of fiddling with glass: shots through windows, often with (irrelevant) mathematical doodles. These are amateurish because the film has no inner cosmology within which one can register the metaphor. Compare this with the use of glass in `Spy Game.' MIT has a specific, abstract feel that is very easy to capture, but it somehow eluded the location scout.See it. Enjoy it. But weep for the `lesser mortals' who fabricated it and mind the opportunities they missed."
"A Beautiful Mind","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0268978/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt/","8"," John Nash, schizophrenic genius. ","John Nash is something of a mathematical wizard. Constantly searching for something with which to make his name, he finds his calling by code breaking for the government. But with that comes a sense of paranoia and pretty soon John is sliding desperately into schizophrenia.There is a school of thought that says any decent film about the mentally ill or afflicted is a sure fire way to attract the awards givers. Personally it bothers me that it bothers me that people view these films in this demeaning manner. If a story is worth telling then lets get it out there for all to see. Would the cinema world and all those stuffy film lovers really be happy if film makers didn't tell these remarkable stories? A Beautiful Mind is one such picture that divides opinions, although exemplary made and well put together, it doesn't adhere quite to the facts of Nash's life-it's an interpretation that smooths out the drama by way of delivering a safe and watchable biography. It was nominated for eight Academy Awards, winning four for Best Film, Best Director {Ron Howard}, Best Supporting Actress {Jennifer Connelly} and Best Adapted Screenplay {Akiva Goldsman adapting from the book by Sylvia Nash}. Yet as great as that roll call is, the big surprise is the omission of a win for Russell Crowe in the Best Actor category. For as tidy and engrossing as the film is, and it is folks, it's because of the big Kiwi that the film breaks free of your standard emotional heart tugger. It's a superlative performance from Crowe and him not winning is probably more to do with his much publicised dust up at the BAFTAS a few weeks before the Oscar ceremony: than his undoubted acting ability.The film as a whole should not be viewed as a representation of John Nash's life, many important things from Sylvia Nash's book have been omitted. But crucially it's important to note that in making this film, the makers have brought Nobel Prize winner Nash to the public's attention, whilst simultaneously giving awareness to the sadness of those suffering with schizophrenia. OK, so it's far from perfect in its portrayal of Nash the man, but ultimately the cinematic world is a far better place when the likes of A Beautiful Mind are being made and the film lovers are flocking to see it. And then some. 8/10"

"A Beautiful Mind","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0268978/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt/","6"," Well Made But Lacks Integrity ","!!!!! SPOILERS !!!!!!Ron Howard's A BEAUTIFUL MIND shares something in common with SLEEPERS , PAPILLION and THE EXCORCISM OF EMILY ROSE in that it claims to be a true story but when you stop to examine the truth you realise that it's not really a true story at all . Perhaps I'm being unfair in comparing it to the aforementioned because in reality the story is similar to Oliver Stone's adaptation of MIDNIGHT EXPRESS in that the source material is based upon a real character but the film invents it's own version of reality Professor John Nash was a mathematical genius but he was also a bi-sexual and a rabid anti- Semite , you wouldn't know this from seeing Akiva Goldsman screenplay where he's deeply in love with Alicia . I guess centering a story around a romantic subplot adds to the film's commercial appeal , never let truth get in the way of good box office . Unfortunately the producers decide to introduce an espionage subplot where it's revealed later on is part of a schizophrenic delusion suffered by Nash . This subplot is very insulting to anyone with any knowledge or experience of schizophrenia because the victim wouldn't suffer the type of delusions seen here . He would suffer from things like abstract signals where the television would try to contact him etc , a schizophrenic wouldn't find himself meeting mysterious men in black or finding himself with a room mate who is part of his imagination etc There are somethings that make Howard's film worth seeing , things like Crowe's performance which might have won him an Oscar if it wasn't down to Academy politics . Connelly's award for best supporting actress was well deserved as was James Horner's nomination for score though perhaps Ed Harris might be upset about not being nominated for best supporting actor . I have to be honest and say that despite director Ron Howard and writer Akiva Goldsman making an interesting movie about mathematics neither of them deserved the Oscar that year . Best director and best adapted screenplay should have gone to FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING along with the Oscar for best picture And remember if you want to know about the real John Nash please read Sylvia Nasar's biography and ignore this Hollywood version"
"A Beautiful Mind","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0268978/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt/","9"," A crazy genius ","Ron Howard has given us a film that's so different from the formula-oriented fare we receive from Hollywood, that this film, although studio born and bred, plays very much as an independent film. The madness of John Nash is approached by the director, and the writer, Akiva Goldsman, with great honesty and restraint. The production has a look that tells us we are seeing the events in the life of this crazy mathematician as it really happened. Nothing seems to be out of place here with the right touch of atmospheric detail in showing the past, when Mr. Nash went from being an up and coming star in Princeton to his being selected for the Nobel prize in 1994, with enough time going into the schizophrenia that almost ruined his academic life, as well as his own marriage.Russell Crowe plays this tormented soul with utter understanding of the man he is portraying. At no time does he strike a false note or gets too carried away with his own acting. That shows a firm hand by Mr. Howard, whose command seems to be behind every shot of this film. Ed Harris is one of the best actors around and let no one tell you otherwise. He expresses so much with the simplest gestures any actor can make. His kind of acting is seamless from film to film. Here he gives a great and understated performance as the man in John Nash's nightmares and make-believe world.The biggest surprise though, is Jennifer Connelly. She demonstrates here as well as in previous work, mainly her previous work in Requiem of a Dream, that she is in a league of her own. She's that rare breed of actresses that go from film to film acting in roles that she disappears into without any fanfare or hype. Congratulations to Mr. Howard for this film."
"Black Swan","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0947798/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt/","9"," I can't believe the work that Natalie Portman put into this film and it's easy to see why she received the Oscar. ","By now, Natalie Portman has already won the Oscar for Best Actress for this film. And, because my oldest daughter adored this film and strongly recommended I see it (WITHOUT her due to the content of the film!), I decide to see it and am glad that I did. Natalie Portman's commitment to this film is incredible. Seeing the weight that she lost, the ballet moves she worked on and the wonderful acting, it's very obvious why she got the award.As for the film itself, I have got a STRONG warning! Before you consider watching the film think twice. The film is at times VERY adult--very adult. Even though there is no nudity per se, there sure is a lot of very graphic content and simulated sex--such that I could understand my daughter not wanting to see this movie with her dad!! Because there are so many other reviews at this point, I'll wrap it up quickly by saying that the film has a wonderful script for two main reasons. First, it's highly original--and I love originality. Second, from a psychological point of view, there are many possible interpretations and it's a great portrait of madness. At the very least, the leading lady is suffering from a SEVERE anxiety disorder as well as schizophrenia--a very, very bad combination to say the least! But I also love how, because the film is often shown from her point of view, you never are sure what is real and what is not--even when the film concludes. You are left wondering exactly what happened and what didn't--and that ambiguity might annoy some, but I appreciated this--mostly because most films explain EVERYTHING and assume the audience is too dumb to try to sort it out for themselves. An intelligently written, directed and brilliantly acted film. Exceptional."
"Black Swan","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0947798/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt/","9"," Beautiful, tragic, haunting and nightmarish ","I personally do not think this movie the best movie of 2010, I did prefer The King's Speech and The Social Network. But overall, Black Swan is a very, very good film.Albeit one with cracks. While the film succeeds as a character study, with a compelling lead character, there are some occasional logic and originality lapses, not in the script though as the script is very original that still holds the level of intensity in the slower parts, and with exception of Nina and perhaps Lily some of the characters could have done with more depth.Those flaws aside, I loved it. But I can understand why people mayn't like it, I especially have a good friend who found it ham-fisted and found it left a bad taste in her mouth, it is often very adult and graphic with some sexual content. Anyone expecting Swan Lake are better off finding a video production or buying a ticket to somewhere like the Royal Ballet, this is not Swan Lake but a melodramatic and psychological character study revolving around a ballerina and the production of that particular ballet.I remember reading that Darcy Bussell(who I respect) criticised the movie for an inaccurate portrayal of ballerinas or somewhat. I am not saying she is wrong, but I think it depends on the ballerina.Even with any problems the film has, it is beautiful, tragic, haunting and nightmarish not to mention somewhat thought-provoking. The camera work with its contrasting black and whites to create contrasting moods is great, complete with stunning costumes, scenery and sets. The choreography is good and you do feel the sweat that the performers exude when performing, but I would have liked more close-ups of it perhaps.The music is haunting and melancholic and the snippets of the Tchaikovsky ballet that you hear throughout are a delight to hear, but again it could have been more, and the finale is dark and exhilarating. The acting is mostly very good. Vincent Cassel is appropriately slimy, Barbara Hershey is terrific as the controlling mother and Mila Kunis is surprisingly wonderful in her meatiest role yet. But what made Black Swan are Darren Aranofsky's bravura direction and the mesmerising titular performance of Natalie Portman.In conclusion, a very good film. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
"Black Swan","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0947798/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt/","9"," Losing Yourself In The Darkness Of The Part ","First off let no one think that if they see Black Swan from 2010 that earned Natalie Portman a Best Actress Oscar that they are looking at a remake of the Tyrone Power swashbuckling classic. Instead this film which has a setting in a ballet company is an interesting combination of plot themes from A Double Life and All About Eve.Company choreographer Victor Cassel chooses promising newcomer Natalie Portman to be the lead in his new production of Swan Lake to succeed his long time star Winona Ryder who is not taking her forced retirement easy. Portman has been Ryder's Eve Harrington, but Portman also has an Eve in her life as well, the younger and talented Mila Kunis. A lot of fine roles for women in this film.Portman is no doubt talented, but she's dealing with a lot of issues of paranoia, a lot of it instilled by her mother Barbara Hershey. She starts losing herself in the dark complexities of the Black Swan as surely as Ronald Colman did with Othello in A Double Life. How it all works out for all the women you have to see Black Swan.And you'll like what you see. It's hard to miss the elements in those classics that I've cited in Black Swan. But if you're going to borrow, borrow from the best. And since an Oscar came Ronald Colman's way and one of her 10 nominations came Bette Davis's way, Natalie Portman sure had a substantial role that she played beautifully.The real surprise for most viewers I think will be Mila Kunis who played the vapid Jackie on That Seventies Show. Kunis provided one of the great lines from television in that show when she stated that no one would deter her from her career goal to be Dallas Cowboys Cheerleader. She should have gotten some Oscar recognition herself for the Eve Harrington type role she plays here.Black Swan is the best film about ballet since the Anne Bancroft/Shirley MacLane classic The Turning Point from the Seventies. Try to see this one by all means."
"Black Swan","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0947798/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt/","8", Incredibly Effective Sexual-Thriller ","Black Swan (2010) **** (out of 4) Brilliant sexual-thriller about dancer Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman) who must put up with her over demanding mother (Barbara Hershey) while at the same time preparing herself for the breakthrough role in Swan Lake. Slowly she begins to lose focus of what's going on due to the director (Vincent Cassel) of the show pushing her too hard and another girl (Mila Kunis) who might want to steal the part. BLACK SWAN, the latest film from Aronofsky, comes as a true tour-de-force and I really can't think of a better structured thriller in the past several decades. I'm sure had Hitchcock himself lived long enough to use the visual medium available today as well as the sexuality that you can get away with today then even he would have been impressed by the end result here. This is an extremely sexually charged movie yet it doesn't contain a single frame of nudity. Aronofsky has pulled off something rather remarkable because the film is like a big puzzle where if one small piece wasn't in the right place then everything around it would just crumble. A lot of credit must go to the director who wants against paints a visual nightmare but also the cast members who are downright eerie in how great they are. What really worked so well here is that you never quite know if what you're seeing is real or not. You enter one reality only to come out in a dream and then possibly continue to be in this dream for the rest of the picture. The way Aronofsky pulls this off is like watching a master working a piano because the director clearly has the audience in his hands and doesn't let them go.As with his previous film THE WRESTLER, it's fair to say that this movie shows what countless others movies had in that it's about jealousy, fear and of course the hard work a professional must do in order to be perfect at their craft. What separates this film is the hellish vision from Aronofsky who uses all sorts of horror elements a lot better than the majority of films that actually try to call themselves a part of that genre. The torments that stalk Nina range from haunting visions to self-mutilation and the pain she feels is easily felt by the viewer. The director keeps the events in the film happening so fast that you can't help but feel like Nina as everything starts to spin out of control and Hell itself finally comes crashing down. The visual look of the film is superb as it ranges from some dark stuff like neo-realism to a beautiful ballet piece at the end. Portman delivers without question the greatest work of her career, which is saying quite a bit as she's always been very reliable no matter what she's doing. The obsession that her character struggles with is beautiful put to film by Portman and you can't help but feel as if you're watching a real dancer and of course someone who really is losing their mind. Hershey will certainly be seen by many as a villain but I loved the way the actress played it. She's not a cold-blooded snake of a villain but instead someone who tries to do good but by trying too hard they become bad. Kunis is so seduction in her part that she's the perfect opposite for Portman and you can't help but believe and feel the two's relationship as the movie goes along. Cassel also turns in a marvelous performance as does Winona Ryder in her small role as the former dancer who is on her way out. BLACK SWAN is a masterpiece of sexual tension and psychological fear. It's a hard film to describe and I'm sure you could show it to a hundred different people and they could all give you a different option of what the film is and what it was trying to do. The film is a real work of art and something that once again proves that Aronofsky is someone to keep an eye on."
"Black Swan","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0947798/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt/","9"," Aronofsky wins again ","Darren Aronofsky is certainly a talented director. PI was an intriguing debut, REQUIEM FOR A DREAM capitalised on that promise with astonishing clarity, THE FOUNTAIN was deeply flawed, but THE WRESTLER was back on track, a heartfelt, faux documentary-cum-character study of a broken man. The good news is that BLACK SWAN is another winner, a creepy and intriguing little movie that's all about the mystery.Although the film is ostensibly about ballet, in reality this is one of those 'slowly losing their mind' type films a la THE MACHINIST. The type of film where the protagonist is plagued by weird visions, delusions and nightmare, a generally subtle effort punctuated by grisly little moments of wince-inducing violence. The screenplay is intelligent and mature, focusing on the characters throughout, and the movie is equally viewable in both the dialogue and dance sequences.I've never liked Natalie Portman, but it's a credit to Aronofsky that she's captivating here and precisely chosen as the porcelain figure leading the show. There are some fine supporting parts as well, particularly from a spiky Mila Kunis, a suave Vincent Cassel (seriously, this man can do no wrong) and a where's-she-been? Winona Ryder. BLACK SWAN is a familiar, if great little movie and well worth a watch for film fans in that it portrays a gripping journey into the dark reaches of the human psyche."
"Black Swan","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0947798/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt/","8"," Amazing Natalie Portman performance ","Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman) is a New York City ballerina living with her overbearing mother (Barbara Hershey). The prima ballerina Beth MacIntyre (Winona Ryder) is being replaced for the opening production of Swan Lake. Nina is the favorite, but new dancer Lily (Mila Kunis) is impressive as well. Nina fits the role of the beautiful, fearful, fragile White Swan perfectly, but she can't get the Black Swan role right unlike Lily. She's obsessed with her deteriorating body as her paranoid mind collapses.This is a great performance from Natalie Portman. There's a sense of chaos and insanity falling down on her. It definitely has the sensibility of director Darren Aronofsky. Although I do wonder where he's going with this movie at times. It has a realism and a horror feel to the movie. Portman's body slowly turns into a horror show is reminiscent of Jeff Goldblum picking apart his body in 'The Fly'. Mila Kunis is playing a pretty interesting mean girl, or is it all in Nina's head. That's the beauty of this movie. It plays not just with Nina's mind, but the audience's mind."

It hones in on the fragility of an artist and lays open wounds that are hard to witness. Natalie Portman's character is driven but vulnerable and s set up to succumb to her art. Of course, rivalry is a given, and her rival does everything she can to put the screws to her. Unfortunately, the questioning of her own talent is going to show at some point. I can't say I enjoyed this movie. I realize that obsession is often a strength with artists, but it can also be all consuming. This film is about as dark as it can be but it puts a stranglehold on the viewers."

","Young girls who have dreams of going into the professional world of ballet, especially in New York City or other locations where major companies are well regarded, should not look to this film for guidance because it is a disturbing view of the tortures and torments that can be faced in one's mind, in one's soul and in one's body.You know from the moment that Natalie Portman walks into the dressing room at Lincoln Center for a rehearsal that these women are cutthroat in spite of their graciousness on stage. They are hatefully gossiping about the prize dancer of the company who is seemingly getting past her prime. This takes the horror of the Moira Shearer character from "The Red Shoes" and turns it into a satanic nightmare for the fragile heroine Portman plays.With a Mama Rose like mother (a frightening Barbara Hershey), Portman is already on the verge of a breakdown so you see it progress to something darker as the film progresses. A crude director (Vincent Cassel), an untrustworthy but sweet costar (Mina Kunis), a star aging out of the business (Winona Ryder) abusing her and Portman's own mind stand up to destroy her as this film takes steps into a darkness that indicates that some movie makers have become soulless in their efforts to create "art".Yes, the entertainment world is cutthroat, and that includes something as seemingly gentle as ballet. There certainly is a correlation between the world of dance and classical music and the world of horror, but the film's themes become pervertadly so certain visuals come along and bring in minor players for no reason so that the script can drop crude references that do nothing to advance the story.It is a film that some people may appreciate for its psychological themes, but I don't think that some of the disgusting dialog in the script (especially by the Lilith like Klunis) have any other point than to corrupt the minds of impressionable audiences. This really becomes a chore to watch as the pornographic insinuations in the script take over. If I began to think that the way that the young women speak in this are how they act backstage in any type of theater, I would have second thoughts about going back. In that sense, this film made me more angry than enlightened and artistically enhanced, and that made me despise it all the more."
"Black Swan","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0947798/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt/","7"," Obsession for Perfection and Madness ","In New York, the twenty-eight year-old Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman) is a dedicated and perfectionist ballerina of the ballet company that lives with her controller mother and former ballerina Erica Sayers (Barbara Hershey). The director Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel) decides to renovate the company for the next season that will open with the Swan Lake with a new face and retires the prima ballerina Beth MacIntyre (Winona Ryder). Nina is his first option to perform The Swan Queen, perfect for the role of the White Swan, but too restrained to perform the Black Swan. Nina feels threatened by the newcomer Lily (Mila Kunis), who can perfectly perform the Black Swan, and is stressed with the situation. When Nina has a nervous breakdown, she gets in contact with her dark side and has constant nightmarish daydreams."Black Swan" is a beautiful but predictable film of Darren Aronofsky, with a cinematography that gives a nightmarish environment to the story that is too dark for a drama and too dramatic for a horror movie. Natalie Portman has a great performance but her character is too naive and with lack of confidence for a New Yorker indicated to be the prima ballerina of a ballet company. The theme is a variation of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde with the case of split personality but the film does not justify the hype around it. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "Cisne Negro" ("Black Swan")"
"Black Swan","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0947798/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt/","8", Engaging psychological horror despite not being as "high-brow" as the ballet frame suggests ","Esteemed IMDb writer Theo Robertson messaged me the other day about this film and, while I skimmed it for fear of having him influence me in terms of his opinion, I did read that several older people had walked out of this film, seemingly having expected some sort of high-brow film with its roots in ballet. One can understand why because with all the award buzz and the superficial subject matter (ballet) combined with the actress and of course the previous work of the director, this must surely be an intelligent piece to be "appreciated" and "considered". What one wouldn't expect would be a film that, with a bit more gore, could easily be just another trashy horror/thriller that is released on video and has plenty of sex, violence and jump scares to it.Well, got news for you, this is what Black Swan is albeit a superior example of the genre. Essentially our lead character struggles to get in touch with her dark side when she wins the lead in Swan Lake, gradually losing touch with reality and/or being hunted by those around her who wish her harm. This manifests itself through some painful scenes of self-harm, imagined doppelgangers, intense sexual discovery, shadowy figures and a domineering mother who keeps her controlling menace under a veil of vulnerability that only falls here or there. It is trashy stuff in a way but it is done very well so that it produces this genre material but does so in a way that feels slightly classy while also engaging more than it would thanks to a brilliant turn by Portman.And she is brilliant. I understand the mother because of how well Portman plays this is not a character she has worked on for a few months, this feels like a product of years under the influence of this mother. She is nervous to her core, frustrated by her own inability to be this "thing" that she has spent her life not being wild, loose, imperfect. Portman nails it and while I don't think it is a brilliant film, her performance is little less than brilliant. In support Hersey is equally as good with less time to do it. The flickers across her face say so much and I was impressed that with so little I was able to understand roughly what had happened in the previous 20 years. Cassel is simplistic but effective in his predatory director turn. Kunis is unbelievably sexual and again she helps the lead role by showing us everything that Nina struggles to find in herself. Ryder is solid in a smaller role. Aronofsky's direction is strong but particularly impressive is the cinematography the camera flows so well around the scenes (and yet appears in no mirrors). I think he knows he is making a horror movie so, although he embraces the ballet, he doesn't avoid the shock or the build of the horror.Some have embraced this film as art and a thing of beauty while others have come away disappointed because that is what they expected it to be but didn't find it. However Black Swan is an effective psychological horror movie that just happens to be set in the world of ballet. As such it is very much a genre movie even if the director etc lift it to feel like more. In particular Portman makes the film I cannot think I have seen her better and her Oscar (can there be doubt?) will be deserved."
"Black Swan","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0947798/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt/","10"," Goose (bumps) ","For 2011, the movie I'm most looking forward to is "Pirates 4" (and "Your Highness"). For 2010 it was "Inception" and "Wall Street 2". And while Inception did match my expectation, Wall Street wasn't quite as good as I hoped for (though it's not a bad movie either). And while I do know of quite a lot of movies that will come out in 2011, there is a chance, that there will be a movie there, that will catch me by surprise ... like Black Swan did in 2010.I am a fan of Aranofsky and I liked his other movies too. But I would never have guessed that Black Swan would have me caught up like it did. It is not a horror movie in a pure sense, but it does have quite a lot of moments of tension. And there is a sequence towards the end of the movie, that had me at the edge of my seat. Plus the goosebumps I am mentioning in the summary line (and the theater was heated!).While "true" horror movies can make you "jump out of your seat", by a music cue, this really did have a strong vibe in the entire sequence. Of course boiling it down to just that (great) sequence would do injustice to the rest of the movie. And the great acting at hand. While the story is not new, the sound design, the editing, the framing, the acting and everything that got put into this movie, works excellent in favor of it.If you had asked me in early December, I would have said Inception is my movie of the year 2010. But then I got the chance to watch Black Swan and I am truly amazed by this. Just talking about it, excites me and that has not happened in a long time. The Golden Globe Natalie Portman received is more than well deserved and only Fincher could have beaten Aranofsky (very clever script and a well earned Globe for Sorkin too). Seems like he (Aranofsky) has Midas touch then ..."
"Black Swan","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0947798/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt/","8"," "Ready to be thrown to the wolves?" ","Knowing only that this movie was about an aspiring ballerina vying for a role in "Swan Lake", I wasn't prepared for a largely dark tale about said ballerina's severe issues with inferiority and the self mutilation that came from the challenge of competition. That theme was further reinforced by the dancer she replaced, Beth Macintyre (Winona Ryder), who virtually committed suicide, even if she didn't die walking out into the middle of city traffic. What a mess these people were. At virtually all times, the picture is an intense psychological thriller that eventually descends into horror when Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman) succumbs to her delusions and her mind begins to slip away under the stress of performing. That she quite literally becomes the Black Swan of the title by committing suicide to achieve her career zenith makes for a stunning finale, and the cheers of the crowd may have just as well heralded Portman's Oscar Win for Best Actress among a respectable field at the 2011 Awards. For potential viewers, be aware of more than a share of shocking scenes, with one in particular approaching, if not actually achieving, a level of undisguised pornography."
"Black Swan","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0947798/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt/","8"," A Bit Over-hyped, But Still a Solid Film ","A ballerina (Natalie Portman) finally gets the big break in Swan Lake as the swan queen. But she starts having mental breaks where her personality shifts more from the white swan to the black swan.The way this film has been hyped as an Oscar film is unfortunate. I just do not see that level of power here. Natalie Portman (playing Nina Sayers) is deserved of a best actress nomination and probably a win, and deserves one for her devotion to the role and the injuries she took during training and filming.Winona Ryder absolutely deserves a supporting actress nomination for her role as Beth Macintyre, and perhaps even the win. Ryder had her glory days in the early and mid-1990s, but I do not think she was ever taken seriously as an actress. While her part in this film is small, I think it is her best work to date.Mila Kunis plays Lily the understudy. I have a personal love of Kunis, and think she is gorgeous. How strong her acting is, I do not know, and I hate to say it, but she may have been the weak point of the entire film and one of the reasons I cannot see giving it a "best picture" nomination. How she is getting supporting actress nominations from various organizations is beyond me.Director Darren Aronofsky has a respectable career, starting with such critical successes as "Pi" and "Requiem for a Dream". Both of these films I feel is better than "Black Swan". Some people love "The Fountain" while others find it pretentious. I lean more towards the latter. And even here, with "Swan", I think he borders on the pretentious. There is a fine line between making art and making high-minded bull, and this film teeters on that line.Although I do not think it is as great as some see it, at least I do not hold some sort of intestinal hatred for it like Steve Erickson, the critic for "Gay City", does. He says the film has "over-the-top combinations of bombastic music, shakycam, and quick editing" with "all the soul of a Skinemax exercise". He finds the film "not very enjoyable to watch", in part because "Aronofsky has no gift for eroticism" and "seems to see sex as a necessary but degrading part of human experience." Erickson is quite wrong, but this becomes obvious the moment he admits that he finds "Requiem" to be "irritating" and never saw it all the way through. What sort of critic can judge a director whose works he has no stomach for?If you do not see this film, I do not think you are missing out. However, it has some strong points and anyone who is a fan of Aronofsky really needs to check this out. That, or if you want to see an emaciated Portman being a sexual creature... but if that is all you watch it for, you are missing the point."
"Black Swan","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0947798/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt/","8"," madness to Chaikovsky ","If Darren Aronofsky's "Black Swan" doesn't haunt you, then nothing will. Natalie Portman plays Nina, a young woman training for a role in a production of Pyotr Chaikovsky's "Swan Lake". She gets the role of the White Swan, but the intense pressure on her, along with the presence of another ballerina (Mila Kunis) who Nina suspects is trying to usurp the role, sends Nina into complete madness.The scenes of dancers gracefully performing ballet is the perfect contrast to intense scenes showing Nina's breakdown. Some of the scenes made me squirm (and I'm usually someone who can take anything in a movie). Much of the movie is shot with a hand-held camera, heightening the tension. Much like he did with "Pi" and "Requiem for a Dream", Aronofsky does a perfect job showing a disturbing descent into insanity.I saw a production of "Swan Lake" in the Mariinsky Theater while I was in St. Petersburg. I recognized the theme song from somewhere else (I don't remember where). That has to be the most haunting piece of music ever written. Having watched "Black Swan", I'm now wondering what was going on behind the production that I saw! Anyway, this is definitely one that I recommend. I didn't see every movie from 2010, so I can't say for certain whether or not Natalie Portman's performance was the best from that year, but she was definitely up there.In conclusion, be suspicious the next time that you see a member of the genus Cygnus.Also starring Vincent Cassel, Barbara Hershey, Winona Ryder and Benjamin Millepied."
"Black Swan","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0947798/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt/","8"," Black Swan ","From Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated director Darren Aronofsky (Requiem for a Dream, The Wrestler), I saw the review of the film just an hour before seeing it on Film 2011 with Claudia Winkleman, it certainly looked the part. Basically ballet artistic director Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel) announces that the New York ballet company he helps run is going to do the production of Swan Lake for the new season, and with the retirement of original ballet star Beth Macintyre (Winona Ryder) means there will be auditions for a replacement lead. The role requires the female performer to play both the part of the innocent White Swan and the deceptive Black Swan, and beautiful twenty-something Nina Sayers (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Natalie Portman) is initially the first choice, certainly for the White Swan. Struggling to convince Leroy that she can play both parts, he has his eye on her competition, beautiful twenty-something new dancer Lily (Family Guy's Golden Globe nominated Mila Kunis) who nails the Black Swan perfectly. Initially Nina and Lily start off as good friends, hanging out together and of course rehearsing for the big production, with Nina as the White Swan and Lily as the Black Swan, Nina even has a fantasy about her in a dream. Slowly though Nina may be losing her mind, as she struggles to perfect get anywhere with Leroy, Lily steals her thunder, and her former ballerina mother Erica (BAFTA nominated Barbara Hershey) suffocatingly controls her. Her distinction between nightmarish fantasy and reality is rapidly disappearing as her skin develops strange bloody marks and scratches, her sky and innocent attitude turns into fiery anger, and she may be turning into the Black Swan she should for the production. Nina may have established herself as the new star for the show, but her darker side has really broadened, and it causes real problems when it eventually comes to the production to go on stage. Nina pulls off being the White Swan in the first act, but one flaw causes her to retreat to her dressing room, where Lily comes in, they fight, and she supposedly stabs her to death with a piece of broken mirror glass, and hides the body. Returning to the stage, this time as the Black Swan, her dark side finally breaks out to the point where she turns into the Black Swan she has "become", in her mind anyway, and she gets a standing ovation from the audience. Before the finale she is shocked to Nina come to her dressing room and congratulate her, she had another hallucination, and it was in fact herself she stabbed, being the White Swan of her, but covers it up and carry on. The last scene of the production sees Nina, as the White Swan, kill herself by throwing herself off a cliff, i.e. off a high stand onto a mat, ending with huge applause, and that is when everyone sees the blood, and she lies dying smiling that she was "perfect". Also starring Benjamin Millepied as David, Ksenia Solo as Veronica, Kristina Anapau as Galina and Mark Margolis as Mr. Fithian. Portman I have often found a mixed actress, with naff films like the Star Wars prequels, not bad films like V for Vendetta, and good films like Closer in her repertoire, I was hoping she would one day do something great, and hear she certainly does. Portman is mesmerising as the extremely troubled ballerina, and she deifnately deserved all the awards, Kunis is really good as her slightly toxic friend, and Hershey is terrific as the dominating mother, and Aronofsky brings back the disturbing he has before. The story is one of the most inventive in the world of ballet, an art form that normally doesn't interest me much, I could say the lesbian moment is great, but seriously, the film is filled with extraordinarily hypnotic moments, most actually quite terrifying and sinister, a must see psychological thriller. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Cinematography and Best Editing, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Film, Best Special Visual Effects, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Editing, Best Make Up/Hair, Best Production Design, Best Original Screenplay and Best Sound, and was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama. Very good!"

","This may be one of the most deliberately confusing movies ever made. Somebody started off with an interesting variation on an old idea. Let's have a very talented person go nuts while achieving stardom and then die after much suffering and one absolutely perfect performance.Instead of the rock scene or movie stardom -- among the more common venues -- we'll set it in the ballet arena. That's full of egotists, isn't it? Kind of like opera? It's a reasonable enough premise. Being a ballet dancer is no easy job. It requires infinite practice, precision, devotion, competitiveness, and a physical fitness rivaling that of a championship boxer. Enough to drive anybody nuts.Then it must have occurred to someone that a movie about a young woman, Portman, who becomes a star at the price of her own sanity is going to have an audience of about ten people, not including the producers and their mothers. Who's going to watch a movie about going for the perfect saute fouette? So they juiced it up using two techniques, both of which manage to scrap any pretensions to seriousness that the original idea might have had.The film has all the clichs of any other straight-to-DVD horror movie. There is the oppressive and demanding mother, Barbara Hershey, from "Carrie." There is the "friend" who may or may not be angling for the role of prima ballerina. The dance director, Cassel, is an untrustworthy heterosexual, and if I remember you'll find the same figure in "The Red Shoes". There's no one else of importance in the movie. Cassel is staging "Swan Lake" and he sees in Portman a very good white swan full of the usual virtues but not her evil twin, the black swan. Portman can't seem to let her passions loose so Cassel gives her helpful instruction like, "Go home and touch yourself." (She can't do it because she's interrupted by the image of her overbearing mother.) Later, Cassel takes Portman aside, begins smooching her fiercely and feeling her up until she begins to respond. At this point he pushes her away and says, "See? I'm seducing you when it is you who should be seducing me." The fool. There isn't a single person who listens sympathetically to Portman. Even her affable understudy, Mila Kunis, may have ulterior motives for trying to get Portman to loosen up, have a few drinks, do a Lude or two.But it's very difficult to tell whether Kunis is a real friend or not because Portman is cracking up and the viewer, like Portman, is unable to distinguish hallucinations from reality. The Jungian shadow is always nudging its way into her life. Does Portman really kill Kunis? If so, she does it in a formulaic and unrealistic way, copped from innumerable other horror movies. She grabs a piece of broken mirror and shoves it into Kunis's belly. As usual, the point pierces the stomach and leaves the hand clutching the glass unmolested. You can't help wincing when you see something as dumb as this. It's like the scene in which two guys are fighting and one knocks the other out by bumping heads. Newton's third law is herewith repealed.And the hallucinations, which seem to involve everything in and around Portman, gives the computer-generated image guys an excuse to go berserk. For no reason at all, while Portman is alone, both her legs snap into the shape of chicken legs with the knees backwards. I guess nobody could think of where to take that dismal picture so it fades to black. I mean, what are they going to have her do, sit down in a chair? Through all this mishigas, the camera never leaves Portman alone long enough to take a breather. She's a beautiful young woman, though her voice comes out in her few lines as a kind of hoarse squeak. But, really, she's in just about every frame and almost always in close up. If she runs down a hall, the camera wobbles along, a foot behind her head. Talk about oppression! It isn't that horror movies are in themselves bad. It all depends on how they're done. Hell, Val Lewton turned out some psychological horror movies at RKO in the early 40s that were masterful, and on a budget that wouldn't sustain a normal person for a year, and barely keep a gerbil alive. This one had genuine potential. It did not actually need CGIs that turn Portman's hands and forearms into bloated, gangrenous limbs. Acute schizophrenia can be rendered in subtle ways too. See Roman Polanski's "Repulsion." I, for one, am beginning to regret CGI was ever invented. Useful for dinosaurs and UFOs, yes, but they're becoming an excuse for not thinking enough about the plots themselves. When your mind becomes blank, you just have somebody's face fall off. Pfui."
"Black Swan","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0947798/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt/","9"," A disturbing paranoid thriller ","Nina is one of the best ballerinas in the company so it is understandable that she hopes to be selected to dance the part of the Swan Queen in an upcoming performance of Swan Lake. Director Thomas Leroy has told her that she is perfect for the role of the innocent White Swan; the problem is it is a duel role that also involves playing the seductive Black Swan and he believes she just can't let herself go in the way that part demands. She is further stressed because rival dancer Lily seems perfect for the Black Swan. As the pressure builds Nina starts to lose her grip on reality in a way that could ultimately lead to her self-destruction.If you sit down to watch this expecting a delightful film about the world of ballet you are in for the shock of a life time there may be plenty of dancing but this is very much a paranoid thriller about somebody losing their grip on reality in a way that is sometimes highly sexual and at others quite gruesome certainly it is one of the more disturbing films that I've seen. We see the world as Nina sees it so like her we frequently see things that aren't really happening and it isn't until later that we learn whether what we saw was real. This sense of paranoia is further enhanced by the way the camera almost constantly follows Nina around. Natalie Portman is brilliant as Nina; I'm not surprised that she won an Academy Award for her performance here. Mila Kunis also puts in an excellent performance as Lily and Vincent Cassel is good as the somewhat domineering director. The film's director, Darren Aronofsky does a great job keeping the sense of paranoia high until it peaks during the finale."

What makes the film so impressive is not so much the storythe descent into insanity has been tackled many times beforebut rather the complexity and skillfulness of Aranofsky's direction, and the sheer power of Natalie Portman's tour-de-force performance as Nina, the frigid dancer who struggles to let go of her inhibitions to perfect the part of the Black Swan.Aranofsky's visuals are absolutely stunning, each meticulously choreographed scene executed with style and precision, the dizzying camera-work putting the viewer on the stage amidst the twirling dancers. Portman has never been better, utterly convincing as a fragile artist whose quest for perfection takes a terrible toll on her sanity. Her dancing is absolutely breath-taking, while her sexier momentsa sneaky spot of masturbation and an oral sex scene with fellow ballet star Lily (Mila Kunis) reveal an actress willing to take considerable risks to nail her role (while giving her straight male/gay female fans something to fantasise about for years to come)."

Director Darren Aronofsky is known for his dark bravado and penchant for ugly physicality; he's an often-brilliant filmmaker who burrows himself into the twisted, downward spiral of a hopeless human condition, taking the audience with him as his prisoners. But here, what with an already-thin screenplay to work from, Aronofsky weakens the picture with his onslaught of visual tricks and shocks. There's certainly potential in the narrative, however the schizoid psycho-drama (which Aronofsky was no doubt attracted to) takes over in ludicrous fashion. Portman wretches and cries and snips her fingernails down to bloodied nubs--it's an exhausting tour-de-force--yet her strongest personality moment is a subtle one (having drinks with the lascivious Mila Kunis in a bar). Written by Mark Heyman, Andrs Heinz, and John McLaughlin, from Heinz' original treatment, the picture is a horrific potboiler; it looks good, and gets off to a very strong start, but dissipates due to the general overkill. The finale is a grand-scale build-up to nothing, with confusing behind-the-stage action and interrelationships, while the actors themselves come off looking rather silly. ** from ****"

It helps that she has a mother, Barbara Hershey as Erica Sayers, a former dancer herself who still treats her daughter with the control that you might for a 10-year-old.Nina is in the ballet company that will kick off the season with a performance of Swan lake, and the director is looking for the dancer who can pull off both roles, that of the white swan and that of her nemesis, the black swan. (I am not a ballet fan, this is my simple understanding from viewing the movie.) Nina wants this role badly, but the director keeps telling her that she is too "controlled", trying too hard to be too precise instead of being more "real." Nina rarely smiles, it never seems like she is enjoying herself, at anything, at any time.A new dancer from San Francisco shows up, Mila Kunis as Lily. It begins to look like Lily is competition for the role and Nina begins to become paranoid about her. Frenchman Vincent Cassel is good as Thomas Leroy, the director. Winona Ryder has a rather small role, as Beth Macintyre the former star now on her way out.The DVD has interesting extras. Even though Portman has studied dance for most of her life, a professional ballerina was used for many of the performance scenes, and "face replacement" was used to make it look like Portman was dancing.SPOILERS FOLLOW: As we view the movie we see some strange things, and in the end most of them turn out to be products of Nina's imagination, generated by her illness. She imagines an evening where Lily comes home with her, spends the night, and they have lesbian sex. She imagines another where Leroy tries to seduce her. And another where she kills Lily and drags her body into the shower of her dressing room. We see her looking into a mirror, black feather stubs are growing on her back, she pulls one out. (She is becoming, emotionally, the black swan.) In the very end, Nina turns loose, gives a good performance, but when she falls into the mattress behind the prop, as the dead white swan, we see she really is bleeding, she has stabbed herself and will die. But she smiled and said the performance "was perfect", she gave her life in her misguided search for perfection in the routine."
"Black Swan","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0947798/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt/","10"," Natalie Portman certainly did a compelling enough job to earn all those awards for Black Swan ","Just watched this movie on a Netflix disc. It features Natalie Portman in her Oscar-winning performance as a ballerina who seems to be lost in her role as the Black Swan. Mila Kunis plays her rival...or is she? Barbara Hershey is her mother, Winona Ryder an aged ballerina who resents being cast aside, and Vincent Cassel as the teacher who can be pretty controlling but still inspirational. Director Darren Aronofsky provides such haunting images concerning the transformation of the Portman character that you wonder if she's truly mad before coming to a definite conclusion. I'd say this was quite a beautifully realized dream-like drama that holds on to you till the very end. So on that note, Black Swan comes highly recommended."
"Black Swan","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0947798/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt/","5"," Black Swan-The Dark Side of Dancing **1/2 ","Remember when Ronald Colman copped an Oscar for going berserk as a Shakespearian actor in 1947's "A Double Life?" Natalie Portman is about to do the same as a ballerina going off the wall in "Black Swan."The ballet scene, especially the showing of Swan Lake is beautifully staged. Did anyone see the similarity between her Natalie's movie mother and Anne Bancroft in "The Turning Point?" Both gave up ballerina careers to pursue families. Of course, this 'Swan' is certainly no 'Turning Point' either.As the conflicted ballet star, Portman turns in a credible performance which will probably be honored on Oscar night, Feb. 27th.As viewers, we are ourselves conflicted. What did ballet director, an excellent Vincent Cassel, and fellow ballerina and rival, Mila Kunis both do to add to Portman's madness? Kunis, at the beginning of the film, acts as though she is a young tough right out of the gangs in "West Side Story." Cassel, as the driving choreographer, is excellent in the role.Portman's downhill descent into madness occurs too quickly. True, that Cassel wanted her to be more devilish in the twin role of the evil Black Swan. It's as if Portman has become the Norma Desmond of ballet. She was certainly ready for her final take, no matter how tragic that was."

"," An exotic look at an unintentional self transformation ","This film is about a ballerina who takes on a role in Swan Lake. She transform from an innocent and perfectionist woman to an evil and self destructive woman.Darren Aronofsky's films are usually not easy to digest, so I find "Black Swan" surprisingly easy to understand. It details Nina's path of transformation as she prepares for her role that requires her to perform out of her character. The imagery and paranoia are very well done; it may be weird and disturbing at times, but compared to Aronofsky's previous work, it is already very mainstream. It successfully portraying Nina's mind as fragile and unstable. The film is captivating, engrossing and manages to keep me interested throughout. Natalie Portman's Oscar buzz is well deserved, and the performance of Mila Kunis is also worth mentioning. In short, "Black Swan" is an exotic look at unintentional self transformation. You either get it and like it, or you don't."
"Black Swan","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0947798/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt/","8"," The darker side of ballet. ","No way to get around it; a well choreographed mess. A stark melodrama about a very serious and ambitious New York City ballet dancer Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman)landing the dream position of a dancer's lifetime...that of the lead in "Swan Lake". The dance director Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel)has a delicate concept of the lead being a sharp balance between the white and black swan; and he knows his former prima ballerina Beth Macintyre (Winona Ryder)is too old for the part. Nina has proved to be solid, hard working and self absorbed in her own perfection. Can she even pull off being the "Swan Queen"? She is driven and manipulated by her mother Erica (Barbara Hershey); but even worse is her own neurotic vision of body image. A beautiful new dancer, Lily (Mila Kunis)joins the dance troupe and impresses Thomas and has Nina obsessing her as a major rival trying to take her new found prominence . Nina searches for absolute perfection and begins her battle with paranoia and delusion. She seems coerced in getting in touch with her darker side via a sexual relationship with Lily...imagined or not it builds self confidence with a deeper descent in mental collapse.Kudos to director Darren Aronofsky for this psychological thriller. In spite of Kunis all but stealing the show; Portman dances away with the Academy Award. Also in the cast: Benjamin Millepied, Kristina Anapau, Ksenia Solo, Sergio Torrado and Mark Margolis. Rated R for the very sensual scenes between Portman and Kunis. (And I am not one to complain)."
