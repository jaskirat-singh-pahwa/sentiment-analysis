"The world loves it, though I still think the original Iron Man, Thor and Captain America were my favorites. ,At this point, The Avengers has made around 100 trillion dollars (or so)--and so its obvious that people love the film. My own daughter went to the premier in New York and then went to it on opening night in general release--and was mad I didnt take her with me tonight to see it! Obviously, she loved the film as well. As for me, I liked it but didnt quite share the overall exuberance for the film. Mind you, I liked it--but I think I preferred the earlier films before the Avengers team was formed. There was a certain charm that I didnt quite see recaptured in the film. Now the film is good--its just that what I like in these other films I would have liked more of in The Avengers. Specifically, the movie could have used a bit more humor and a bit more character development. When I read the IMDb trivia, it seems that originally the film had about 30 more minutes--all showing Steve Rogers (Captain America) trying to adjust to his new life. I would have LOVED seeing all this--and less of the HUGE battle at the end of the film. For me, it just felt numbing after a while and I would have liked more of the characters when they werent fighting. Again, however, I DID like the film....but the earlier Marvel/Disney films I liked just a bit better. Just my two cents worth...",negative
"Not 100% perfect but still an outstanding film in so many ways ,Superhero films are always fun to watch when they are done right, and while to some degree it is understandable why people wouldnt be totally enamoured with it(as seen in a lot of the negative comments, a lot of them being condescending though- enough with the ignorant conspiracy theories already!- and some not even worthy of being called reviews) Avengers Assemble for me was an example of a fun and intelligent superhero film that was done right. True, the story is formulaic but not to the extent that was too distracting. In fact my only two complaint was to do with one performances that didnt quite work personally. And that was Jeremy Renner who was rather on the dull side as Hawkeye, whose character development did seem a little rushed and underwritten, that Hawkeye has inner demons is made very clear but it could have come through more strongly. However the rest of the performances were great, a big shout out going to Tom Hiddleston who is serpentine personified as Loki, though Robert Downey Jnrs charismatic Iron Man, Samuel L. Jacksons no-nonsense Nick Fury, Mark Ruffalos very confident Hulk(he doesnt make you miss Eric Bana or Ed Norton), Chris Hemsworths dynamic and not wimpy Thor(if he was I put it down to his hidden demons character development) and Chris Evans modest, heartfelt Captain America were equally great. Scarlett Johansson convinces mostly too, Black Widows back story is intriguing and Johansson is wonderful when she acts fearless but when in her emotional, imploring moments her acting is rather forced and out of character for Black Widow. For a film with as many characters as seen here, Avengers Assemble still makes a vast majority of them very interesting(only Hawkeye really disappointed), in character and not one-sided and all of them have their turn to shine. It didnt feel to me like a film that tried to cram in too many heroes all at once for the sake of it. The film is very slickly made with astounding special effects and dazzlingly executed stunt-work. Alan Silvestris score pulsates with power and the action sequences are exciting. The story may be formulaic and standard good-and-evil but is crisply paced and intelligently handled with just the right blend of humour, pathos and action with not one component over-shadowing the others. What was really enjoyable especially was the toe-to-toe with Thor and Iron Man and Hulk. What was really remarkable was the script, filled with thoughtful exposition and snappy banter that stayed true to The Avengers while also with Joss Whedons own style that was apparent in a lot of his other work. Overall, Avengers Assemble may not be 100% perfect or among the best ever but it is still an outstanding film with a lot to love about it, and no this is not coming from a fake account or a plant, just someone who can be hard to please who genuinely enjoyed it. 9/10 Bethany Cox",positive
"A Gem of an Action Movie ,The Avengers (2012) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Nick Fury brings together Iron Man, the Incredible Hulk, Captain America, Hawkeye and Black Widow to join forces and do battle against an enemy that threatens global security in this rather amazing comic book adaptation. Ill be honest and admit that comic book movies arent my #1 type of film and it wasnt until just a month before THE AVENGERS opened that I bothered to check out the casts supporting movies. I enjoyed the two IRON MAN movies, thought THOR was very good, THE INCREDIBLE HULK was entertaining and I found CAPTAIN America to be decent but no matter what I felt about those films it couldnt prepare me for how much I enjoyed this one. Director Joss Whedon has created something incredibly special and you really cant help but think hes raised the super hero bar so high that many future films are going to have problems reaching it. When bringing all of these characters together, the filmmakers could have taken an easy route and just give us mindless action but that wasnt the case here as Whedon really delivered a deep but easy to follow story and he knew how to have fun with it. The constant banter between the superheroes could have led to some very unfunny moments but the screenplay was so smart in allowing each of their personalities to come through and then added the fun of taking those personalities and throw them at one another. This banter really turned into something incredibly funny and allowed for some great one-liners as well as some terrific action. When it comes to these type of movies I usually complain about a couple things. One is the obvious CGI but that wasnt a problem here because it just looked so realistic that it never took you out of the story and instead it put you more directly into it. Another thing I usually complain about in recent mainstream movies are the expanded running times. THE AVENGERS clocks in at 142-minutes, which made me nervous going in but it turns out that this film proves long running times are okay as long as you have enough to support it and this movie does. In fact, the long running time felt extremely short as the film flies by without any problems. Say what you will about comic adaptations but theres no question that THE AVENGERS is first rate entertainment thanks in large part to the great direction, the detailed writing and each of the performers fitting their roles and bringing them to life. This here is without question a complete success so future comic movie makers had better step their game up.",positive
"Wanted to hate it, ended up loving it ,Im not really a comic book fan, so after hearing the constant hype about this film for a couple of years I really wasnt too fussed when it finally appeared on TV. I went into it expecting not to like it much, and indeed the first hour seemed to me middling at best: some mildly lame comedy, a whole lot of posturing, and a silly storyline involving silly characters.Then things changed. They started to pick up, and the action started hitting home. Then all hell broke loose with a climax that felt like it lasted a whole hour, an hour packed with kaiju-style mayhem as New York found itself subjected to an alien invasion. And I was wowed. Never before has it been possible to depict such constant, wide-scale mayhem, but with the improvement of CGI technology its finally up there on screen with all of its glory.And yes, I ended up liking MARVELS AVENGERS ASSEMBLE. Whats not to like, really? The whole feel is kept light and there are so many larger-than-life characters that you end up having a ball with it regardless. Mark Ruffalos Hulk is my favourite character by far - Ruffalo is far better suited to the role than Eric Bana or Edward Norton - but Chris Evanss Captain America comes a close second. Sure, I see this film for what it is: a mindless piece of crowd-pleasing, overblown CGI mayhem, replete with a silly, buffoonish bad guy - but at the same time I cant help but getting caught up for the ride.",positive
"Avengers vs TDKR ,Nick Fury brings together Earths mightiest heroes to stop Loki who is unleashing an alien invasion.Robert Downey Jr. makes this good and Joss Whedon makes this great. Downey has already shown that hes a movie star. He could power a whole franchise all by himself but the Avengers is more than just a one man team. This is a quintessential Joss Whedon Scooby gang, and hes great at the snappy dialog and friend-hate comradry. This is a whole team of heroes working together.Because of its timing, this will be compared to The Dark Knight Rises. Most seems to give TDKR more credit because of its darker grittier tone. Both are great but I like Avengers better. Honestly, TDKR is inferior to TDK. There are logic problems with TDKR. There are too many comic-book moves in that film. Its melodramatic in its emotionally manipulations. The Avengers is simply better written. Its dialog is better. It may be simplistic but its more fun.",positive
"Im Too Old for This! ,Im swearing off super-hero movies. Ive become abundantly aware that there are legions of fans out there who cant wait to see what Hollywood is doing with the classic comic book characters. But after three Iron Men and now this, I see a sameness in them all, and Im not equipped properly to enjoy them as I should. Im still rating this pretty high because it is amazing to look at, the special effects are beyond belief, and some of the characters have some dimension. That said, I think I would need a manual to really get the true impact of each character, what his or her powers are, and how they fit together. There is always some evildoing bad guy who has some history with the others. This is what makes comics what they are (I read lots of comics as a kid, so I do understand the milieu). When you get right down to it, however, they seem to rely mostly on beating each other over the head with whatever is handy. Its like watching professional wrestling which is sort of comic bookish in its own way. Its a cast of characters what represent simple things, both good and evil. Ill leave these to the kids and continue to watch movies with complex characters and clever story lines.",negative
"New York Geography ,To love movies is to enjoy good movies, no matter how you define them. If there are good movies, there are bad movies. While some people claim to hate CGI, there are those of us who consider it another tool to make a movie, but think it can be misused.I like a lot of superhero movies. I have been enjoying most of the Marvel Studio movies, but some are better than others. It turns out I like the big fight sequence in the first Avengers movie because it clearly takes place around Grand Central. I can relate to it, since I am a native New Yorker. I take pleasure in seeing how the Helmsley Palace tunnels are used, and the Pershing Overpass. The Spiderman movie with the elevated train along Canal Street annoyed me.There are lots of movies that use movie geography that makes no sense and they dont all use CGI. There was a Michael Keaton vehicle about twenty years ago called THE HARD WAY which annoyed me with its nonsensical geography. The problem is not CGI; Its using CGI or other techniques to enable bad scripts.",negative
"A success yes, but not really on a groundbreaking level ,Here we have The Avengers, the five-year-old movie from 2012 that was really breaking all box office records back 5 years ago. The director and co-writer was Joss Whedon, at that point mostly known for Buffy and Toy Story, the film that brought him an Oscar nomination. But now, this one here is certainly his career-defining work. The era of superhero blockbuster films had already started back then and RDJs Iron Man franchise was going well enough for using his popularity to bring up a Marvel superhero all-stars film. Thor and Captain America of course have their own films now too. But back to this one here. Hiddleston was still doing a good job and Loki as a villain definitely does not get old too quickly. Some great potential this character has. Not a surprise at all, Whedon was also going for comedy next to the fantasy, drama and action sequences. Most of it was working out well like the restaurant scene at the very end. The only parts I did not like from the comedy perspective were probably the Tony Stark one-liner moments, but thats also subjective.This film was nominated for its special effects for a BAFTA and an Oscar and lost both times to Life of Pi. Of course, fitting the box office success, it received many other honors during the award season back then. At slightly over 140 minutes, it is a really long watch indeed and I think there were enough insignificant moments to stay under the 2-hour-mark. But I still take it as it is as there wasnt a great deal of dragging which is certainly a success for its duration. Back to the villain, Loki may have been the primary antagonist here, but there is a lot more conflict in here, most of all the Avengers managing to grow into a team that manages to hold their egos back a bit for the greater cause. Its a long way to that. And when its finally done, Loki reappears by opening the gates to hell or the gates to the other end of the universe as they were saying. So what was the best thing here? Yes it may be the special effects work indeed as they helped the film nicely to overcome a few lengths. And I am not talking about the spectacular stuff like the explosions here, but also for example about the more subtle effects like what Iron Man sees written in his mask.So yeah, overall I think this was a good watch. Everybody will have their favorites from the cast, but as the film is so long, every bigger character gets his solid deal of screen time. For me, these would be Jackson, Renner and ScarJo of course, even if I must admit that SLJs character did not do a whole lot for me in here. Its a film you want to watch when you are in for some pointless fun. Its of course not a realistic movie at all from start to finish, but its still a success and not just in quality, but also definitely from the commercial perspective. No surprise number 3 is coming out soon. Still the IMDb and RT ratings may be a bit too high to be honest. Nonetheless, if you are not one of the million people who have seen and rated this blockbuster here on IMDb, it really is high time to finally go check it out. Today was the second (or third) time I watched it and I think it does not lose any of its appeal on rewatch. Go for it, especially if you like Marvel films. I give this first (new) Avengers film a thumbs-up. The character are really interesting and fun to watch, not just during their introduction in the first 45 minutes.",negative
"Avengers Assemble at once ,It takes effort and skill to pull off a project like this.Twenty years ago Marvel had comic characters that translated into poor films while DC had Batman and Superman movies.Now Marvel Films have a juggernaut. They released their second tier superheroes (Thor, Captain America) to great acclaim and it all lead up to The Avengers film where the characters of the Marvel cinema universe converged.Iron Man as portrayed by Robert Downey jr is the main man with his witty one liners and conflicting with the more straight up Captain America. There is a lot of substance with Mark Ruffalos Dr Banner keeping his alter ego monster at bay.Joss Whedon as co writer and director balances action, adventure and laughs.Each of the character gets his time in the sun, Loki is the malevolent presence.No wonder the film was a behemoth at the box office.",positive
"Excellent Adventure ,Loki (Tom Hiddleston), the stepbrother of Thor (Chris Hemsworth), teams- up with the Chitauri Army and uses the Tesseract power to travel from Asgard to Earth to plot the invasion of Earth by the Chitauri and become the king of Earth.The director of the agency S.H.I.E.L.D Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) sets in motion the project The Avengers, joining Tony Stark a.k.a. the Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.); Steve Rogers, a.k.a. Captain America (Chris Evans); Bruce Banner, a.k.a. The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo); Thor; Natasha Romanoff, a.k.a. Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson); and Clint Barton, a.k.a. Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), to save the world from the powerful Loki and the alien invasion.The Avengers is one of the best adventures that I have recently seen and a dream for fans of comic books, joining the MARVEL heroes in a witty story. The special effects are state-of-art and instead of writing a long review, I suggest the reader to watch this highly entertaining movie. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): Os Vingadores (The Avengers)",positive
"Consistently enjoyable effects and noise with the right amount of fun mixed in ,You could be forgiven for approaching this film with trepidation for many reasons. The most obvious is that it is a big superhero summer blockbuster film a type of film that is popular but all too often disappointing (indeed an accusation that could be levelled at films featuring characters in this film). Secondly though, a common problem with all the various character films leading up to this joint effort is that they generally struggled to make all the characters fit and you had the constant feeling that all the positioning and introductions were hurting the individual tales just for the sake of this joint one; so I did wonder how it was going to cope with all these characters running around in one place.Ironically enough though, the character balancing turns out to not be a massive problem in this case and I think it is partly because they do all exist as equals within the same plot lines, rather than being forced onto others. The plot is suitably overblown and involves an intergalactic threat rather than a man-made one; again this concerned me at first because I didnt particularly care for Thor and I did get the feeling that this would be more of the same, with gods and mythical creatures running around. To a point this was the case here because to the casual viewer (which I am), these aliens arent really known or understood but the film does make it work because it allows it to be just about serious enough to avoid spoof but at the same time generating sufficient fun so that you go along with it. In some ways it is the polar opposite of the other big superhero franchise out this summer (Batman) because where one aims for darkness and introspection, Avengers really has no interest and instead focuses on delivering fun and action in an easily accessible and enjoyable package.And this it does. Across all the characters we have good humour and banter which never undermines the action but rather adds to it, giving it a sense of fun that engages and helpfully prevents you questioning the detail too much or having things like specific comic banter stand out against the serious nature of the action. There are lots of nice comic touches and lines but for me Hulk randomly punching Thor was the high point (with the puny god moment being a very close second). The cast go with it and I liked that everyone did work together without any one specific character hogging too much of the screen. Downey Jr is fun as normal and he works well with Evans, who I thought was better here than he was in his own film. Likewise Hemsworth benefits from a bit of decent humour and fun (two things lacking in his own film) and Ruffalo makes for a good Hulk, again though he is helped by the lack of having to carry a whole film. Johansson and Renner are good in support and the rest of the cast features good turns from many familiar faces, none of whom get in the way but all contribute to the fun.It is easy to turn your nose up at Avengers because it is basically an effects-driven summer blockbuster about superheroes, nothing something that always delivers, but to do so would be to ignore the fact that there are good and bad examples of this and that The Avengers is one of the good ones. Colourful, busy, fun and generally very entertaining it delivers everything it sets out to do and I found it very enjoyable for this.",positive
"If they cant save the box office, they sure as hell will avenge it ,Im still having my fingers crossed that the Avengers will overtake Avatar as the most successful movie ever (until another movie burst and takes over that is). It would be such a great success and I would be so happy for Joss Wheddon. A real nerd amongst filmmakers he has made it big time. As we speak Avengers has broken quite a few records already and it is on a good roll. And all that is more than deserved. While I dont think it is necessary to have watched the other Marvel movies so far (especially not the different Hulks), the Avengers will make you want to watch more (look at your local video store for confirmation!).All the characters are here and have their moments. Maybe Thor is the one that gets a bit shorthanded time wise. But then again, he is god, so he wouldnt care anyway. Mark Ruffalo is winning (as a Charlie Sheen would say) with his performance as Hulk/Bruce Banner. Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man is entertaining as ever. And even if some claim that Captain America is not needed, I think he brings Gravitas and is more than valuable to counter the jokes of an Iron Man and bring some much needed bonding to the whole Crew. Chris Evans is perfect for that role.The movie has been criticized for the weak villain. I think that does injustice to the movie. While the characters (bar Hulk?) have been introduced to you, this still is a forming of a group. It is more about the Avengers, than it is about any villain. And I dont think Tom H. Loki is that weak (even if Hulk does disagree).I watched the movie twice now and I enjoyed it both times. Time flies by and you dont realize how fast 150 minutes can go by. I like the fact, that Joss does not treat the viewer as if he were stupid. So maybe some will not get the joke/bet between Capt. Americas character and Sam Jacksons character (though I reckon it wont be many), but I loved that the movie did not make a big deal out of it.Since this is a Marvel movie, you should know by now that there is a tag scene coming at the end. A friend of mine knew immediately what (or rather who) we saw there. Youll find the answer on the internet. That scene came in between the credits. There is another scene after the credits which as of yet, was not shown in Europe, but will hopefully make its way onto a digital release (DVD, Blu Ray or whatever comes next). Im so looking forward to it ... oh and the 3D is nice, but its the story/characters and everything else that will sell you to the movie ...",positive
"The world has gotten stranger than you even know. ,Well how do I put this across so it doesnt sound like Im trying to trash the movie? Ive been around since Stan Lee created Spider-Man, and some of the other Marvel super-heroes were around even before I was born. So I grew up at a time when the technology wasnt up to the task of putting what we see in todays Avengers on the big screen. With that said, it looks like what we have here is all sizzle and no steak. The CGI and special effects components of this flick makes it an all time blockbuster spectacle, so if thats what youre all about, you wont be disappointed. However if youre looking for a story with nuanced characters and an intriguing plot, youve come to the wrong movie. This is all about wringing out as much action and adrenaline pumping machismo that any fanboy could possibly ask for. So on that score it works, but I need something more, even in a super-hero movie.With that out of the way, there were some genuinely funny moments in the picture that added the slightest dimension to the principal characters. Of all the players, Robert Downey Jr. probably brings the greatest sense of professionalism to his portrayal of Iron Man. Hes out there, hes serious when he has to be, and hes a wise guy when the situation warrants. As for the the CGI Hulk - who ever thought hed wind up being the comedic sidekick in a story like this? He had at least two stellar moments that brought my theater to life, the rag doll whipping on old Loki (Tom Hiddleston), and the sidearm swat to Thor (Chris Hemsworth) that was so outrageous it just brought the house down.Apart from some of the witty comic book dialog, the rest was all relentless and gratuitously destructive special effects, exceptionally well done of course, but gosh, how much can a city take? Which by the way, is never dealt with as part of the aftermath of a super-hero barrage when a cosmic power like Loki comes to town. How about a film where citizen action groups bring charges against Iron Man, Thor and Hulk for destroying their city? Just kidding - how are you going to get them to court? Say, I know Stan Lee missed a cameo or two along the way in these Marvel flicks, so I was glad to see he showed up here, even though it was probably his quickest one ever. If you blinked you missed it during the cable news roundup following the final battle. Its going to be a sad day when Lee wont be around any more to make these appearances.And now for my final rant - as I write this, The Avengers has, in just two days, made it to #31 on IMDbs list of Top 250 Films. My post will be #495, so in less than a full weekend, movie goers have vaulted this film to a rating right up there in between Its a Wonderful Life and Sunset Boulevard. Doesnt it seem like theres something wrong with this picture? Personally, if I were making the rules, Id allow all the reviews in the world right out of the gate for a new release, but withhold ratings on a picture for at least a year or two after its come out. OK, maybe six months. I think that would take some of the distortion out of the rating system, and someone like Joss Whedon wouldnt have to go around being embarrassed by comparisons to truly great films.Back to The Avengers - stick around for the closing credits for a preview of the next mind blowing Avengers flick. You know theyll be there because Nick Fury said so. THANOS!!! You think they can destroy more property than you saw done in this film? Id bet on it.",negative
"Great Movie... But Not That Great ,Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) of S.H.I.E.L.D. brings together a team of super humans to form The Avengers to help save the Earth from Loki and his army.I want to first address the IMDb rating on this film. Currently, it sits at an 8.3 and is said to be the 140th greatest film of all time. Now, no matter how good you think it is, does anyone seriously believe it is one of the greatest films ever made? I mean, really? I grew up reading comic books, so the films are a bit of a different experience for me than they are for others. I think the movies have the comic fans as their biggest base, which is good, because otherwise several references and foreshadowings are going to be missed. If you do not know who Hawkeye is, for example, it may cause you to wonder why a government agent is jumping around and shooting off strange arrows.My biggest concern was: how do you make a movie about a team where the individuals have such strong personalities? Particularly the Hulk, who is not a team player. This was addressed.",negative
