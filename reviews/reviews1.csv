People go missing during this time. Strange things happen to them as eventually they arrive at THE STAIRS!!!.The characters for the most part were decent.

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10083174/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","2"," A very generic creature film and I don't recommend this one in particular. ","A watered down supernatural horror movie and I have seen loads of these types in the past and most of them superior to this one.This one seems to be directed by a novice. The actors are all bland - no one actually shines in the acting department.The special-effects in this movie are below mediocre - don't expect any SFX wizardry. Indeed I find movies I that have seen twenty years before have better special effects. In this light I am saddened by the loss of the great SFX legend: Stan Winston(1946-2008) whose alien queen sequence is legendary.The plot of this film concerns a young boy who is taken for a hunting trip by his grandfather. Soon deep into the woods, the boy discovers a mysterious stairway that leads nowhere and suddenly is attacked by an unknown creature and dragged away, his screams alert his grandpa who comes to his aid but is unable to rescue him.Years go by and a new group of people come to this exact spot and once again the events of the past unfold.Sloppy direction, mediocre camerawork and background sound-effects, backed by amateurish acting make this one a very dull and predictable movie to sit through.Some better movies to see: Mutant 1984, C. H. U. D. 1984, Troll 1986, Pumpkinhead 1988, Leviathan 1989, Tremors 1990, Split Second 1992.These are just a few movies, there are so many more that I can't write down all of them. Cheers!"

When it first started with the grandpa and boy I could tell it was gonna be one of those cheesy acted movies. But then cut to 20 years later and the real cast comes in and it seemed to pick up and possibly become a fun and only slightly cheesy movie. Nope. Aside from a few funny moments before the first scare, that is really all it offered. Then comes the "scary' barefoot girl. And the witch huts. And the weird creepy guy in the woods. I was interested until this point. Except THESE WERE NEVER EXPLAINED!!!!! Huge flaw, as what was even the point?!?!? Because then the movie took a whole other direction, it's like they weren't sure what they wanted to do with the plot. The funniest and best character died first, and then the movie got super cheesy again. With the forced dialogue and cringy acting. The lighting in the woods was terrible. It was basically daylight all around them in the middle of the night. Then out of nowhere they try and force this emotional scene with the main guy about his brother, all while hiding from a monster in an RV and speaking at FULL VOLUME the whole time. Like they can't even speak in hushed tones while they are hiding?? :D :D I could not even take it seriously at this point. Not to mention the kid has zero reaction when he finds out he has been missing for 20 years, hasn't aged a day, and this was his old childhood friend all grown up. Right, and why did they monster need to break out of the door that the people shut, when it was HIS lair? It wasn't even locked, and he was literally just out ten minutes ago killing the other guy. And another thing, does the door open inward or outward, because it kept changing. Also, the kid said there were a bunch of monsters, so why did the stairs catch on fire when that ONE monster was set on fire? I could forgive the acting and dialogue a little if there weren't so many glaring plot holes and things that just made no sense. That's just bad writing."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10083640/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," Fun and Non-sense both in Limit.. Bhoot Police is neither haunting nor too funny but never becomes a headache. ","Bhoot Police (2021) : Movie Review -Like some industry people have said themselves, 'Horror-Comedy is a risky genre'. No matter if 'Stree' has opened doors for this genre even for family audience who never turned up to watch Horror flicks in theatres but for this one film they broke that tradition. The major reason was the Humour that film carried, it was organic and hilarious so it worked big time. After Stree, some filmmakers have been internationally making films in this genre thinking that they might create another Stree but they failed to understand that it's not that easy. Recently, 'Roohi' came out as a big disappointment and then people really understood the value of Stree and whether or not any film can match its level (the same director is bringing Bhediya so I'm hopeful), that we will see in future. For now, Bhoot Police is a decent Timepass. Neither damn too funny nor haunting but somehow manages to hold the audience and their interest in this knavish ride.The film is about Two brothers whose job is to hunt and eradicate ghosts for money and they are assigned a project in a remote village where once their father freed people from the ferocious ghost called 'Kichkandi'. I liked these names you know, there is something about these names which Bonafides the values of horror material. 'Kichkandi', 'Vibhooti', 'Chiraunji' and 'Ulatt Baba, it all sounds funny. Though, these characters have lose corners while looking at sensibile side of their roles. The female side is a complete disappointment. Yami Gautam and Jacqueline Fernandez's Characters fails to find that tunning needed for the narrative and both became predictable very soon.Acting wise, there is nothing much in the film. Arjun Kapoor as Honest tantrik may look better sometimes but rest of the time he's strictly average alongside Saif who is damn funny occasionally. Yami still seems to be acting but Jacqueline as an actor is terrible in every single frame. God knows when she will learn proper dialogue delivery. The supporting cast is okay but could have been better. Bhoot Police has some dialogues scoring laughter, and such that are inspired from social media and politicians memes. The screenplay is not boring and that i think is enough when there was nothing much in the script to interest you.Pawan Kriplani hasn't been able to crack perfect formula of Horror-comedy but thankfully he hasn't done horrible mistakes. This could be a lesson for him and other filmmakers who are making or will be making films on same theme. Bhoot Police could have had better climax if the writer hadn't opted for outdated theories and if the director was smart enough to avoid loopes. Nevertheless, it can be viewed once by all kind of audience, doesn't matter even if you don't like it, you won't have a headache.RATING - 5/10*"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10083640/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","2"," Avoid this ghostbuster!! ","Bhoot Police review :A desi Ghostbusters type movie and a supposed horror comedy; Bhoot Police neither scares nor tickles your funny bone. At most, it makes you angry at the slip shod plot, drab screenplay and a rather uninspiring performance from the entire cast. Director Pavan Kirpalani, who made Ragini MMS (2011) and Phobia (2016) earlier, goes horribly wrong this time.If the idea was to make another 'Stree' (2018), sorry to say but Bhoot Police doesn't grab your attention for even a minute from start to finish. In fact, the first five minutes itself make you realise that this is going to be one bore of an endeavor. Saif and Arjun are ineffective. Yami appears lost. Jacqueline looks sexy and still can't act saala. As for Rajpal Yadav and Javed Jaffrey, I sincerely hope that it was the lure of a fat fee which made them sign up for such thankless roles!!Without wasting any more time and effort, I end my rant review with an AVOID warning.Regards, Sumeet Nadkarni."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10083640/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Decent Watch ","Review By Kamal KBhoot Police' is first and foremost a children's horror film. There is no gore, barely any swearing or skin and it is quite light-hearted. And the best part it has a good storyline to keep any adult interested. Such a good storyline in fact, that the film feels completely mismanaged.This scriptwriter and the director manages to mess up the film so much that even some of the good performances seem quite gaudy. Still, we do get a couple of decent performances on screen. Saif Ali Khan is the standout among the lot. You can actually see the actor trying to carry the film through his acting - which is unfortunate because the story of 'Bhoot Police' is actually good. We usually see Saif as the logical lead character, or notorious villain on-screen nowadays but after a long time we finally get to see a funny Saif Ali Khan portrayal onscreen. He does a good job most of the time.Overall, 'Bhoot Police' is a decent one-time watch. While the dialogue and direction can get tedious at times, the story and Saif Ali Khan's acting make up for it."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10083640/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Marginally Better than Roohi! ","Since the astonishing success of 'Stree'; Bollywood has been busy churning out even more Horror Comedies. Merely cashing in on their popularity among the masses. Unfortunately, not all achieved the same heights. Following my discouraging session with 'Roohi'; I had gone in with zero expectations out this time.But unlike last time, I quite enjoyed this ride!Don't get me wrong, it's in no way a great execution nor it comes any close to being anything substantial for that matter; yet in the grand scheme of things, this does propose a unanimous nobility of pure pastime. Irrespective of its cheesiness or the melodrama; some aspects did function well.For instance, the dialogues are hilarious, and may as well be the strongest suit down here. In conjunction with the palpable chemistry between Saif & Arjun; Let's just say I adored this Elder Brother-Younger Brother dynamic.Technically it's a fine display too. The locations are eerily beautiful and it certainly adds up to the film's all-around spookiness. The score might not be one of its brighter sides, but does a pretty good job nonetheless! No major complaints whatsoever.At the same time, my biggest gripe would be the countless possibilities that have been utterly squandered. The core narrative has had a tremendous potential to go much further but it could not. All due to the incompetencies sported by the Writers as well as the Director himself.Even though I still believe they should be lauded for their honest efforts as Horror Comedies are still in their infancy in India and as well as in Bollywood so these are nothing but all stepping stones heading in the right direction."

The younger Chiraunji is mighty serious about his knowledge and the inheritance ofca special bound handbook of ghost busting from their father that he hopes he can put to use somewhere. But Vibhuti has no faith in this mumbo jumbo and uses the business purely for commercial purposes - he believes that most of their clients make ghosts a vehicle for achieving some objective, and he has been able to prove himself to his younger brother more often than not. Inspector Chhedilal (Javed Jaffrey) has been hot on their trails because he thinks that the two brothers (and their late father) are unscrupulous and earn money by conning people.The services of the two brothers are contracted by Maya (Yami Gautam) who invites them to her tea estate, which she claims is spooked by a Kichkandi (please Google if you don't know what it is), and the maleficent soul has scared half the village out of its mind. Vibhuti obviously finds it a goldmine of an idea to make money, whilst Chiraunji believes that this will perhaps test his skills. The brothers arrive at the village and start working towards unearthing the facts and busting the myths. In the process, both the brothers learn about their strengths, weaknesses and also develop a mutual respect.Bhoot Police is just uncannily funny and could easily pass off as a comical adventure, until some paranormal developments are discovered when it takes the turn for the serious. Even though the end is serious, director Pawan Kripalani manages to inject some humour into it. Saif is the life of the movie and pulls off a hoot, Arjun Kapoor having played his alter ego makes an impact. Yami Gautam and Javed Jaffrey are their usual selves. It's Jacqueline Fernandes who once again gets on to your nerves and you wish that someone can just wipe her away from the screen, the plot and the film. Bhoot Police is a one time watch if you have 128 minutes to spare and enjoy sitcoms with a spooky twist."

The laugh out loud moments are however, very few and far between and except for Saif, the supporting cast rarely join in on the fun.Jaqueline Fernandez was given an intelligent role for a change and the actress has reveled in it, delivering her sarcastic, deadpan lines with elan. Arjun Kapoor and Yami Gautam couldn't perform much given their poorly written roles with director Pawan Kirpalini never devoting much time and effort into character development.One could forgive the thin script and the cliches if the so-called horror comedy delivered the laughs and the jump scares, but 'Bhoot Police' unfortunately fails on both fronts. Despite Saif Ali Khan being in top form, the writing wears too thin for the film to entertain audiences throughout.Not recommended!"

","BHOOT POLICE is the story of two tantriks who discover themselves when trying to ward off an evil spirit. Vibhooti (Saif Ali Khan) and Chiraunji (Arjun Kapoor) are brothers who pretend to be ghostbusters. They are the sons of the famed Ullat Baba (Saurabh Sachdeva) who died when Chiraunji was just 5 years old. Vibhooti doesn't believe in the existence of ghosts and spirits. Till now, they have encountered several instances where there were no evil spirits. But instead of telling their clients the truth, Vibhooti and Chiraunji would pretend to eradicate the ghost from their lives and take a fat fee in return. Vibhooti, however, believes that ghosts exist and is waiting for an opportunity to teach an evil spirit a lesson.He opportunity arrives at their doorstep when they meet Maya (Yami Gautam). She runs the Silawar Tea Factory and owns a sprawling estate. She lives here with her sister Kanika (Jacqueline Fernandez). Yami tells Vibhooti and Chiraunji that she and the tea factory labourers have experienced the presence of a ghost (aka kichkandi) in the estate. A similar spirit was seen at their place 27 years back and it was Ullat Baba who had trapped it in a pot and kept it in a safe place in a forest. At the estate, Vibhooti, who still doesn't feel there's any ghost in the estate, challenges the kichkandi.BHOOT POLICE focuses on ghostbusters and that gives a unique touch. Pavan Kirpalani, Pooja Ladha Surti and Sumit Batheja's screenplay (additional screenplay by Anuvab Pal and Devashish Makhija) is entertaining. The characters are very well fleshed out and the balance between horror and comedy is well maintained.Saif Ali Khan is the best performer in the film. He slips into the part of the wicked tantric effortlessly and adds to the madness. Arjun Kapoor is sincere. His role doesn't allow him to contribute to the laughter quotient. But he seems apt for the part and looks quite better than his other film appearances off late. Yami Gautam is excellent and goes on another level in the pre-climax. Jacqueline Fernandez is a scrap, she doesn't even know how to act. Jaaved Jaaferi fails to raise laughs. Saurabh Sachdeva and Girish Kulkarni (Santu the monk) are there for just a scene and deliver worthy performances. Late Amit Mistry (Hari Kumar) has a substantial role and is entertaining. Jamie Lever and Rupesh Tillu leave a mark, especially the former. Yashaswini Dayama (Guddi) is too good. Rajpal Yadav (Goggle Baba) is wasted. The kid actor playing Titli is adorable.On the whole, BHOOT POLICE has a weak first half but the post-interval portions are quite entertaining and thrilling. The combo of horror, comedy and emotion makes for a perfect weekend watch."

It could actually breathe some new life in the tired Bollywood Horror genre, which is none.Full credit to the director too."

","#sanjuzzreviews A conman (Saif) and his brother Arjun kapoor go about displaying their non existent skills as tantric's conning people of their hard earned money. What happens when they come across a case where they have to deal with a real ghost (Kichkandi) forms the rest of the plot.Saif and Arjun Kapoor are good with some genuine laughter invoking moments in the film . But most of these are covered in the trailer itself & these moments are far too less when compared with a film like Stree or Go Goa Gone .. needed more of these to make an impact. Yami Gautam is good as the owner of the tea estate which is haunted by the Kichkandi. Jacqueline Fernandes as her sister looks pretty and isn't bad either.A scary ambience is created with a good background score & VFX. There is also a twist in the tale which is interesting.Mixing comedy with horror is always difficult and this is where the film falls short. Putting comedy when a genuinely horror invoking scene is about to unfold, dilutes impact of the horror and makes the comedy look like buffoonery. An opportunity missed as I loved the concept and this could have been a great franchise like Ghost Busters for Indian audiences.A decent one time watch for people who like the horror-comedy genre. The film is not as bad as Roohi & Durgamati... yet lacks the finesse of Stree and Go Goa Gone...adios "

","Story is nothing new it is quite similar to Laxmi that released last year.However, the place where this film scores better than Laxmi is that the comedy in this film genuinely works out in places (if not everywhere). And to my absolute surprise....no unneccesary songs in between except the title track that plays only at the end credits so kudos to the makers there.But being a horror comedy, there is more of comedy and less or zero horror except for one or two jumpscares. KichKandi looks like a ghost version of Groot! XD.Performace wise - 1. Saif is the best and brings in the maximum laughs. 2. Arjun is okayish but comedy films dont suit him at all. 3. Yami is good. 4. Jaq is wasted .To add salt to wound in the wasted category, you have Javed Jaffri and Rajpal Yadav in small roles and I can now say with a really painful heart that these two epic comedians cant make you laugh anymore. Even in the smallest given role, Rajpal miserabely fails to make you laugh while Javed only made me laugh in that "Burping" scene.Overall, a one time watch time pass that actually can be watched with family but go in with zero expectations."

Decent bgm.Supporting cast:rajpal yadav and javed jaffrey could hv been utilized more. Wanted to see more from them honestly. Amit mistry is brilliant. It just hurts me knowing that we won't see him again on the screen. Such a big loss for the film fraternity. His comic timing is excellent.SAIF ALI KHAN: this man is something else. U give him quirky, goofy roles n he just thrives tenfold. Such an actor. His comic timing is impeccable. He elevates the product to a whole new level.Writing and execution: the writing at places is smart and spectacular. Some quirky references which will make u chuckle and laugh. But its the execution which could hv been better. A bit more nuance and detailing could hv made it even better.Horror and comedy: the horror does manage to frighten u but those scenes are too less. The comedy works really well. U won't laugh out loud hysterically but saif would make u laugh nevertheless.Overall, it is not that bad as the reviewers and mainly critics are telling. U can definitely watch it and enjoy it. Irate it 7 out of 10."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10083640/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," It's an entertaining film. ","I was quite skeptical going into the film because of the not so great reviews it received from the critics, so while watching the film, I kept waiting for the moment where I would say to myself that it was a mistake to watch this, but that moment never came, because I found the movie to be quite an enjoyable ride. This whole idea of bringing together comedy and horror is a very good one, and I feel that more movies should be made on this theme. Saif Ali Khan has mastered the art of comedy by now, and he is in top form once again. Arjun Kapoor has truly made an effort to act in this film, which is commendable, but of course a better actor would have probably added way more depth to the role. The original choice to play Chiraunji was Ali Fazal, I wonder what made them replace him with Arjun Kapoor. Jacqueline Fernandez's only job in all her films is to look stunningly beautiful in every single frame, and she has done that very successfully in this film as well. I don't think any director selects Jacqueline for her acting skills. Yami Gautam on the other hand can definitely act and she has done a wonderful job in the film. Surprisingly there are no songs in the film, which was great but very unusual for a movie like this. Another good aspect of the film is the social commentary done throughout, like villagers being made to shout "Go Kichkandi Go" to scare away the ghost, like the event from real life where a group of people shouted "Go Corona Go" to defeat COVID-19. The first twist in the story is easy to see, but the second twist catches you completely off guard, and makes the film a little more endearing. Bhoot Police is an entertainment film that has mystery, drama, comedy and romance, and every once in a while, all of us hope that someone makes these kind of films, and I am really glad that a film like this got made."

The ghost walking on the walls, doing 'chakrasana' and puking is so overdone it's not even watchable anymore. It'd have been a far better movie if they stuck to the non-superstitious narrative.Special effects are hilarious. Cinematography is good."

The plot is about a young girl visiting a fertility clinic to help get pregnant. There is something more going on about the clinic and why her husband is obsessed with her going there. Or could she delusional.The films script and direction spent majority of the movie in the fertility clinic. Seeing Pierce Brosnan as the doctor and telling the main girl that everything is perfect and doing great as he checks her out. Thats where most of the film takes place.

But at least it always feels like it has the potential for something shocking to happen around the next corner.It's a reasonably strong cast for a movie like this. I'm so used to seeing Pierce Brosnan in safe movies that it was a little surprising to see his character doing some of the stuff he was here. Ilana Glazer in the lead role really impressed me. I've only known her from 'Broad City' before now, but she showed she definitely has the acting chops to take on a serious role.The ending of this movie is bananas. It's a lot of fun and was the pay-off the movie needed. I actually wanted more from the movie and to know what was going to happen next when the credits rolled. This is one of those stories where it doesn't hit you immediately just how dark what is going on actually is. I enjoyed 'False Positive'.

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10096842/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","2"," mother! Load ","IN BRIEF: A horror of a film.JIM'S REVIEW: (NOT RECOMMENDED) False Positive is a loopy and uninspired horror film about infertility and "mommy brains", a phrase I never heard of, but everyone else in this movie has, since they banter the term regularly throughout the movie. The film is a very bad re-working of Rosemary's Baby without the supernatural ties or the class.Lucy and Adrian Martin (Ilana Glaser and Justin Theroux) have been desperately trying to have a child to no avail. After Adrian urges his wife to use the services of his mentor and eminent fertility doctor, Dr. John Hindle (Pierce Brosnan), they score a triple run on their first time at bat. But as Lucy contends with her pregnancy complications, be they real or imagined, strange events continually occur, none of which are ever fully explained. Are things being created in her "mommy brain", or are others conspiring around her? She'll find out in nine months. As for moviegoers, you never do with this muddled far-fetched screenplay.There is no logic or suspense in this foreboding tale, just lots of dopey nightmarish sequences, cheesy CGI that are downright silly, and a blood-spattered Grand Guignol climax that implodes every scene before it. Mr. Lee's direction is consistently sub-par and he unsuccessfully relies on visual excesses and bloody gore effects to build tension. (Cinematographer Pawel Pogorzelski must have taken Mr. Lee's discussions with him about making a dark thriller far too literally, as many "atmospheric" scary scenes are dimly photographed which hides any possible action.)The screenplay by director/writer John Lee and its leading lady, Ms. Glaser, purport their film to be a disturbing psychological thriller, but everyone acts either so sinister or strangely proper that nothing makes any sense. Scares are at a minimum, unintentional laughs are more a-plenty.The actors (and the audience) deserve better, although Mr. Brosnan comes off unscathed as the good doctor, and Gretchen Mol as his loyal Stepford nurse provides some nicely underplayed menace. As the new parents, Mr. Theroux has no real character to play and doesn't, and as for Ms. Glaser, let's just say she's no Mia. Good grief, she's more Mamma Mia in her stilted acting choices.No, there is nothing really positive that I can say about the disappointing and absurd False Positive. Except to add: Prognosis negative...mommy brains and all!"

It has a vague "Rosemary's Baby" vibe to it but doesn't come close to being even half as good.Just spare yourself the headache and waste of time."

Her husband and his work was extremely boring and didn't contribute anything. And those other very rich pregnant women are so boring and irrelevant, too. And that midwife? Was she only a dream and why would she dream her as a mystical psychic and all? The nightmares she had was even worse. The doctor and his husband meet up at a hotel room to have sex. Then there's a safe of her husband and she found some documents and it turned out the doctor impregnated her and they had the twin boys instead of the girl. She killed the doctor and his loyal nurse who don't have a gag reflex (that's what she said) and went home covered in blood. She imagined throwing the boys out of the window and then she gave them to her husband and kicked them out of the house. And then took the dead fetus in her arms to breastfeed her and she hallucinated that she was alive. I don't know what this was all about. It was so disjointed and so anticlimactic that I stopped caring about anything happening. The ending was rather controversial though that she's breastfeeding a dead fetus and imagining throwing the baby boys out of the window and all."

The movie has its decent thrilling moments, but the lifeless script and bland performances damn the film. One of the weakest entries in A24 library."

A couple having trouble getting pregnant went to a famous doctor for a fertilization. However, paranoid came in as she doubted those surround her.This movie tried to have a female character going increasingly crazy and finally lost their mind. It's supposed to deliver the message in a disturbing way. I enjoyed this genre and recently watched First Reformed, Saint Maud, and Censor, and I loved all three. Unlike those three, False Positive barely gave me any of the anxiety and slow-burn suspense.There were many plot points in the movie that were nonsensical. The way where the main character became doubtful of the doctor was weird and sudden. The progression of the story felt off, and many scenes were introduced for disturbing sake, and not to actually have a meaning in the story. There were also some weird visuals that didn't amount to much.I was hoping that all this slow building up would lead to a disturbing revelation. And it did surprise me. However, the execution was pretty bad, and I didn't feel like the ending paid off all of the set up.Overall, a pretty boring and slow movie that tried to be disturbing but failed. 5.5/10."

At least this one had actors that were likeable in a sense. As a woman who has twins, this movie was more of a creepy one verses a horror. I think the thought of this happening to any woman would be a horror but they made this more on the creepy side. I read a review and went into the movie comparing it to Rosemary's Baby. I should have never done that because it was not like that at all. Kids were not evil, just Brosnan junior's, nothing evil there. It might had made for a better movie is the kids were evil but oh well. It was a slow paced drama, thriller, and would be creepy (Not scary) to watch if you have ever had babies before. I do hope Wendy was still alive and not just in the crazy lady's head. Also, after seeing Door in the Woods for the first time, this movie could possibly be above 6 for me.

Yes, it feels a lot like Rosemary's Baby through the meat of the film, but that means IT'S WORKING - a lot of horror films try that formula and can't pull it off. The intrigue is conjured properly - while some elements are predictable, there are enough twists and turns that at least a few of them are bound to take you by surprise. Some elements fall into realism, and some are far more outlandish, but they're all wildly entertaining.You've got to give it to Ilana Glazer for her sharp turn out of both the comedy genre and the tone of the character she is known for (Broad City). She co-wrote this and it seems reasonable to assume that at least some of the elements included must be based off of some of her own pregnancy fears (she was actually pregnant when they shot this), as absurdist as some of those fears may be (as many of our fears are). Her dramatic performance isn't always 100% believable, but she still carries the film very well all the way through. Pierce Brosnan's character is also especially hammy, humorous, and creepy all at once. I found much to laugh at within his dialogue and performance - very enjoyable.I figured that when iconic makeup FX artist Malina Stearns recommended this to me, I would be in for a treat. I didn't know what to expect from the film's conclusion but personally I was pleasantly surprised. If the only type of films you value are Oscar bait or stuff like Scorsese, you might hate this, but, if you're open to absurdism, B-movies, or I suppose if you're just a horror fanatic - I really think you're gonna get a kick out of this one. It has just enough unique elements, between it's bizarre visual segments, subtle humor, and occasional poetic moments, to stand out in the long run. Honestly, it's one of the best movies I have seen this year so far, if not the best."

I changed my mind...and since I only rate movies as 1, 5 or 10...I'll give this a 5, which I think is reasonable.So, if you believe this movie has captured what women go through during pregnancy. Please seek help and never have a baby. It's a horror flick, not a docudrama.With that out of the way, I thought the first two acts are mostly effective. I could sense A Cure for Wellness vibe, as I think anyone who enjoys horror flicks would. Also, the "twist" is easily guessed - of course the Doc has a "God complex," duh, all men have that complex, at least according to crybabies who dye their hair blue. Others see Rosemary's Baby - outside of the "everybody is in on it" angle, I don't see any other similarities. This isn't a supernatural movie.Since feminists love to believe everybody who doesn't believe like they do are being "gas lit," you're gonna love this. The gaslighting here is epic. Everybody is in on the scam...even her husband, who appears to bat for the other team (or maybe not, it's not clear if it's a Mommy Brain delusion or her husband is actually...you know.). Regardless, real or not, the goal is to keep his wife off-balance.I didn't hate this movie, the final confrontation was nice and gory...and, as a final twist...

Alot.What the movie settles for is the filmmakers' reliance of the artificial ambiguity of this "let's blame IVF baby brain" plot device for any attempt at suspense. It gets so muddled and tiresome that you won't care what's going on.At one point, there is a kiss that seems like an interesting part of the film. Nope.

This was that kind of movie. Actually the premise of this movie was quite promosing but poorly executed. I think it maybe would have a different result with a different director, that knows how to present a mystery movie without trying to force it too much.Home Sweet Home followed a house of four family members, each with their secrets. Another member of the family was a fugitive who lived in the basement of the house under the protection of the head of the family. The stories unfolded layer by layer, overlapped each others, so pay really close attention to the last 20 minutes, in order to avoid confusion.

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10098288/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," Roohi is nothing but a spoofy joke under the name of Horror-comedy. A wholesome disaster, exactly half of "Stree". ","Roohi (2021) : Movie Review :In 2018, Maddock Studios amd Director Amar Kaushik established an idea of Horror-comedy genre in bollywood with a blockbuster movie 'Stree' and since then there hasn't been any film going close to it. The same production house decided to convert it into an horror-universe and that's where the idea of Roohi was born with different parents, i mean different writers and director. Unfortunately, the idea is completely destroyed by the new guardians and the child is born lame this time. Roohi just didn't fail to understand the criteria of horror-comedy but also fails to deliver the content even in Horror and Comedy individual genres.Roohi is a story of an young girl named Roohi (Janhvi Kapoor) who is haunted by the ghost called Afza. The infamous duo of crime reporters played by Rajkummar Rao and Varun Sharma kidnaps Roohi to marry her with someone against her will, but then both of them falls in love with her from different point of view. This creates a confusing yet hilarious narrative which ends up on a pathetic note where neither one of them makes sense. Roohi falters in keeping the engaging elements alive because of outdated an forceful regional humour. The writing tries too hard to bring intentional laughter but fails miserably due to the poor structure of it.Performance wise, Janhvi Kapoor is the name who actually gets something in sense of acting because of the dual role she plays. She looks cute as Roohi and the exact same horrible in Afza's get up, so the variable nature makes her character interesting. Somehow the soulless construction and less dialogues reduces the quality of work which is highly disappointing. Talking about the crazy duo of Rajkummar and Varun, yes the chemistry and bromance is enjoyable at some occasions, thanks to the slapstick one liners but both of them don't actually get anything to showcase their acting talent. The supporting cast is strictly average, nothing to be mentioned here.Roohi is not a long film but it looks long because of boring narrative. The comedy factors aren't high and the horror show is poor as well. Most of the times it leaves audience in predictable situations therefore the excitement for the upcoming scene is never built. When something seems to feel interesting towards the end (of course because we realise that it is going to end soon), it shuffles the entire plot in completely different direction where the dead end is absolutely childish. Dialogues are over humourous with extra regional accent while some of them are not even understandable. Director Hardik Mehra picks a blunder to carry forward the excellency of 'Stree' but he forgets that it was directed by a sensible director like Amar Kaushik who knew exactly what to do with the script. The biggest difference between Roohi and Stree is the writer-director combo, and hopefully the makers would think about it with upcoming films in this horror-universe. Overall, Roohi is another disaster during the pandemic season and we certainly need a vaccine to survive the quality of bollywood movies.RATING - 4/10*"

","As the movie began, due to the poor response from critics I thought may be its because it shows women in poor light.As movie progressed I thought it may be because of unusual paranormal nature which even I believe Dr.'s handle better.It's a nice movie if one respect's riti-rivaj & partial account is taken like in fake locations and developed story line.Finally a mark deducted coz I feel if gay marriage was permitted than both men should have married and a story in that direction should have been developed."

","What had to be a Horror Comedy with the innate fusion of Social statements, turned out to be half-baked in every regard. Alongside occasional laughs and ingenuous moral stand underneath, "Roohi" may not be a total disaster yet it certainly is a big letdown.'From the Makers of Stree' well that tagline alone gives you a bucketload of promises and belief! Sadly, they were not in a position to deliver. Largely due to its shoddy writing and shallower character portrayals!The writing hasn't submitted enough conviction. A prolonged Screenplay doesn't help either. Pacing is indeed a key issue here as the duration of 134 minutes felt like more than necessary.Although, technically It's been an effective showing. A competent Cinematography together with an infallible Soundscore; favorably establishing the prerequisite ambiance!Moving onto the Performances...Rajkummar Rao, Varun Sharma; despite being two formidable talents, their individual enactments appeared as caricaturish and overstated. Now some would argue it was an obligation for the kind of Script they had; but still, things should have been handled in a better fashion. Janhvi Kapoor as Roohi did all she could. She's steadily improvising and I am genuinely glad for her.In conclusion, I'm mainly upset with its unforeseen downfall on the comedy front. Catching sight of all the promos and trailers in prior; I was seriously awaiting a mirthful ride. Sad to say, it just wasn't meant to be!"

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10098288/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Quirky, brisk, engaging and funny ","Bhawra (Rajkummar Rao) and Katanni (Varun Sharma) are employed by Mujeerabad Zalzala, a local newspaper run by Guniya Shakeel (Manav Vij), in Baagadpur, a town where "Pakdai Shaadi" is a popular event. Pakdai Shaadi is a marriage where a girl is kidnapped for purposes of forced marriage once she has been chosen by someone who wants to marry her. Shakeel is also one who operates an outfit of kidnappers for this strange practice. On one such contract, Shakeel instructs Bhawra and Katanni to kidnap Roohi (Janhvi Kapoor) - initially reluctant as it's not their profession, they set about the task and manage to kidnap Roohi. What they do not know is that it's a bad idea and they have got the raw end of the bargain, as Roohi is possessed by a spirit.Their nightmares begin as they lock up Roohi in an isolated cottage far away from Baagadpur, and her alter ego comes into being every now and then. Bhawra is scared out of his wits at the transformation of Roohi, but Katanni finds Roohi's alter ego, Afza (yes, Roohi-Afza, that's the lethal combination for your consumption) irresistible. When Afza goes dormant, Roohi is exhausted and repentant, which draws sympathy from Bhawra and he falls in love with her. So in a bizarre twist, Bhawra loves Roohi and Katanni loves Afza, leading to a few hilarious episodes involving the three. The rest of Roohi is about getting Afza to leave Roohi's body, exorcism and a climax that's unconventional.Roohi is not a sequel to Stree, but is made by the same team. Varun Sharma is certainly the trump card as his antics keep you constantly in splits. Rajkummar Rao pales in comparison to him. I must state here that both are fine actors and are currently at the risk of becoming typecast as they seem to be doing similar roes, with much aplomb. Jahnvi Kapoor as Roohi is sans makeup and appears scary as Afza - a few sequences are definitely chilling. Roohi does work as a horror comedy, but its unconventional end may be considered underwhelming by most, and gratifying by some others."

It's neither funny nor scary.To take the character of Varun Sharma is the most dumbest decision ever. It was meant for comedy but became a cringe. Rajkumar is okay, liked Jahnvi also specially the voice of the witch. Stree was something else, Roohi is nothing in front of stree.

Jhanvi is ok but the problem is she doesn't have the great looks of her Mom (Sridevi) or other actresses of today so fails to impress the audience. Advise to Rajkumar Rao, it's time to move on to other genres. Advise to Indian directors/producers stop pushing these unworthy star kids on the Indian audience, promote true talent."

","#sanjuzzreviews This horror-comedy from Maddock films tells the story of two protagonists, Rajkumar Rao and Varun Sharma who kidnap Janhavi kapoor (Roohi) without knowing that she is possessed by the spirit of a Chudail-Mudiya Pairi (a spirit with her legs turned inside out). There is a twist in the tale when both Rajkumar Rao & Varun Sharma fall in love with the girl. Rao with Roohi & Varun with the Chudail knowing fully well that only one can get her. Do they manage to get the chudail out of Roohi & somehow manage to live happily ever after forms the rest of the plot.Roohi was supposed to be a sequel to Stree, but doesnt live up to the expectations. The jugalbandi between Rao and Varun is great and there are a few scenes which genuinely invoke laughter. Janhavi doesnt have too many dialogues, but looks scary as the chudail-mudiya pairi.Cinematography too is good. The right ambience for a good horror film is created by shooting the scenes in a dense jungle to create a feeling of unease. The two songs Panghat and Nadiyon paar are well choreographed and lyrics are catchy too.However the script is weak & just when a great horror scene is about to unfold, comedy gate-crashes into it dissolving the complete essence of what would have been a terrifying scene. This happens time & again throughout the length of the film & the impact of both comedy & horror is lost.The concept of Mudiya Pairi is interesting and could have been more chilling with a tighter script. All in all, I had expected more from the makers after Stree. Not too bad, but it ain't great either...adios"

I did notice that the protagonist undergoes very little character development and somewhat like a Miyazaki protagonist basically gets to enjoy and adventure of being proven right.But it's still a vibrant and engaging story that doesn't really feel fresh enough to be a theatrical release but it enjoyable for any fan of the franchise even if they haven't seen the whole of the FiM era yet."

It will remind you of the original, but it's more modern. It is very entertaining and interesting. If you have watched the My Little Pony series before, you will enjoy this.The storyline follows Sunny (Vanessa Hudgens) who is an Earth pony and she meets a unicorn named Izzy (Kimiko Glenn). Unicorns, Earth ponies and Pegasi aren't friends anymore and it is unlikely to see them together. Sunny and Izzy realize that all the ponies don't have any magic and they need to find out why. They travel all through Equestria to find out how to get magic back for everyone.The songs in this film are very catchy and creative. My favorite song is "Glowin' Up'' performed by Sofia Carson, because it is upbeat, sets the mood and is a good song all around. The storyline is fun and shows us how the times are much more different than it was with the original ponies. My favorite character is Sunny, because she doesn't believe what others want her to believe and she never gives up. She grew up with people always telling her that the other ponies were bad, but she knows how to see the good in them, so she thinks differently. Also, when times get tough Sunny never gives up.The message of My Little Pony: A New Generation is friendship is magic. If you have been a My Little Pony fan since earlier shows, this message will pop right into your head. This is a great film to watch with the family. Is an awesome film to watch.I rate My Little Pony: A New Generation 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 6 to 11. You can watch this film on Netflix starting September 24, 2021.

Musica numbers are another good thing here and a huge evolution from G4, variety of instruments are played between every song and the characters singing voices fit well, giving good vibes; this alongside the voice cast, they do a great job specially for Izzy, Pipp and many other characters so you understand their personalities and attitudes.Everything good has something not so good, and this time is the predictive plot, is not really that bad but you can see how it will develop; basil MLP stuff that is not awfull to destroy the movie but it's there. There are also a few misteries that aren't solved through the story, but i guess if they do a show after this it may be solved; i don't know if that would happen.This movie fits right in for the old G4 fans and this will or may grew another Brony Gen that will create tons of content with our new characters; totally recomended."

There are complaints that it isn't more of the same. There are complaints that some aspects of the story remain a mystery. But it's the first episode of a new series. Of course there needs to be mystery. It didn't end with this, it just begins.What is the Earth Pony Magic implied by the rainbow hoof prints? What or who caused the divide in pony societies? Two questions to answer in an upcoming series.But taken simply as what it is, episode one, it's beautifully animated and deals with tricky social issues in a way that doesn't necessarily treat children like idiots. It's characters are archetypal but strong. At its core, the message is that ignorance and fear leads to segregation. That friendship and social harmony develops from understanding.There are going to be a lot of people downvoting this because the notion of friendship being a magic brought through understanding is "too political" and lambasting that this isn't MLP:FiM season one. But I think enough people are sensible enough to realise that at its heart, this new generation carries the same message.Looking forward to seeing where this new series goes."

Sadly this movie does not live up to the standard of humor or sophistication set by the Friendship Magic series. While a few references make it clear this movie wishes to benefit from the popularity of the TV series, it is essentially a complete re-imagining of this universe, but not for the better. While the TV series was creative in its stories and cleverly challenged harmful female stereotypes, male-dominated power structures and violence-based action in kids entertainment, this movie is cliched and reinforces certain harmful female stereotypes which we are surely past in this day and age, especially for showing to our kids. Specifically, the only good parental figures in this movie are male, the mothers are either missing or narcissistic, lying and manipulative, a trope which has become far too common in children's entertainment - seriously, what's going on here? Do the makers of all these shows despise their mothers? Kids are easily influenced. Being told the same story, over and over, is going to have an effect. Lets have a few different stories for our kids, please. At the very least it will make movies less predictable and more entertaining."

Lydia Berman is left an orphan after a Miscreant destroys a subway train. She gets bullied at school until Emily Stanton comes to her rescue. They break up as Emily is focused on following her parents' bio-engineering work to create superheroes out of regular folks. As adults, Lydia (Melissa McCarthy) is a blue collar dock worker still living in the old neighborhood while Emily (Octavia Spencer) is the head of a large bio-engineering company. William "The King" Stevens (Bobby Cannavale) is a power hungry politician. Laser (Pom Klementieff) and The Crab (Jason Bateman) are two of the Miscreants.This is getting panned and I know why. There are issues with the writing. Ben Falcone continues to be a problematic writer-director. Here's the thing. I like this cast. There are a couple of light chuckles. Mostly, I like these actors and I appreciate this cast of characters. The most important chemistry has to be Melissa and Octavia. One gets a sense of their friendship off the screen. It's a mistake to have the break up. They can still drift apart but they need to remain friends. So I'm glad that Emily readily accepts Lydia's surprise visit. The problem is that Emily is too much of a wet blanket. Also it makes no sense that she would take the invisibility treatment herself. It would be better for both of them to be accidentally infected with super-abilities. It all affects their chemistry in a negative way. They do still work but mostly due to their natural chemistry. Jason Bateman's Crab has the most potential and the weird sex game is probably where the movie generates its best comedy. In the end, I chuckled a little but this is not that good. Falcone's work continues to be flawed and the great cast struggles against it."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10121392/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," An out of place superhero comedy... ","Now, I have to admit that I was sort of dreading sitting down to watch the 2021 action comedy "Thunder Force" given the rather low rating the movie had managed to acquire here on IMDb. But still, I do like both Melissa McCarthy and Octavia Spencer in comedy movies, and since I hadn't already seen "Thunder Force", of course I sat down to watch it.And I must say that I am glad that I did, because I enjoyed this movie. It was a wonderful comedy with a spoofy superhero layer pulled over it, and it actually worked rather well. Now, writer and director Ben Falcone is getting some wind for his movies, but I think he actually makes adequate movies, and "Thunder Force" definitely was entertaining and enjoyable.At the risk of triggering a tsunami of anger, then let's just face it that both Melissa McCarthy and Octavia Spencer is not what you would think of first when you think superheroes. And that is what makes this movie work out so well, because they pulled it off so nicely and they made this movie their own. They both added so much charisma to the movie and really were excellently cast for the roles of Lydia Berman and Emily Stanton respectively.The storyline told in "Thunder Force" was a good one and it definitely provided me with proper entertainment from start to end. Normally I am not overly keen on superhero movies, but a spoof like this is something that appeals to me.However, when the movie was starting to bring up gender neutrality and lesbian relationships, I must admit that I had to sigh. Not that I have anything against such convictions or anything, but the whole thing of it permeating everything that comes out of Hollywood with its political correctness is just something that has become a tad too much. But luckily it was mere two scenes, so it wasn't something that had an impact on the movie.Aside from Melissa McCarthy and Octavia Spencer, then "Thunder Force" also have the likes of Jason Bateman, Bobby Cannavale, Kevin Dunn, Pom Klementieff and Ben Falcone on the cast list. So it is a rather good ensemble of actors and actresses that participate in the movie. I must say that I was especially entertained by Jason Bateman and his character in the movie.Visually then "Thunder Force" is a movie that easily stand aside movies from Marvel or D. C., yup. Yeah, I think so, because the special effects in the movie were really good, as were the visuals.If you want a superhero movie that doesn't take itself too seriously, and if you like spoofs, then you should definitely take the time to sit down and watch "Thunder Force". It was actually a rather enjoyable and amusing movie.My rating of "Thunder Force" lands on a six out of ten stars. This is definitely a movie that I would recommend watching."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10121392/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," Formulaic and Funny, if not Superly So ",""Thunder Force" appears already to be getting mostly panned, and its humor surely and understandably isn't to everyone's taste, which is fine, and, indeed, there's nothing especially novel about it. Melissa McCarthy's fat-and-stupid routine has been the modus operandi of Peter Griffin for nearly 20 years now, Eric Cartman for over 20 years, and Homer Simpson for over 30 years. Kevin James, Lou Costello if you want to go way back, and maybe some heavies in Keystone and other silent comedies before that. Often, as here, this character is put in a duo with a straight (wo)man of dissimilar qualities, so we get Olivia Spencer's wealthy genius and parent, and, physically, one character being black and the other white. And, the superhero framework is exceedingly generic. Estranged childhood pals (the smart and not a nerd--"there's a difference"--and the class clown protecting her from bullies), science-y mishap, training montage, typically-crazed boss villain, a literal time bomb, and the self-sacrificing white savior act.But, I found it funny enough. McCarthy really carries it, and her husband writer-director gives her plenty of room to do her usual schtick. Teaming up again with Jason Bateman, playing a crab-man this time, results in some of the most hilarious bits. Contrary to its otherwise formulaic nature, you don't get much of mutant sexual relations or stinky superhero costumes in MCU and DCEU burgers. Olivia Spencer gets sidekicked some here, but she plays the straight counterpoint well enough. Melissa Leo is mostly wasted, though.It's a lightweight and decidedly low-stakes superhero comedy overall, but I rather like that after seeing so many why-so-serious variations on the superheroic, end-of-the-world genre that seemingly occupies every other recent movie I see nowadays, whether the tear-jerking back in "Avengers: Endgame" (2019), the four-hours indulgence of "Zack Snyder's Justice League" (2021), or the muddled politics of the latest episode of the drawn-out streaming series "The Falcon and the Winter Soldier" I viewed before "Thunder Force." The supervillains here, by contrast, are well established before the heroines emerge, and they're just psychopathic criminals with no conspiratorial motive beyond accumulating political power--rather realistic except some of the villains have pincers for arms or shoot lightning out their body."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10121392/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," I Enjoyed It ","This film didn't seem to go down all that well with the critics, but then again I generally don't pay all that much attention to the critics. Well, okay, the average punters didn't seem to think all that much of this film as well, which is a shame because honestly, it wasn't all that bad. Sure, it isn't one of the greatest of films out there, and I certainly didn't find it all that funny, but it was still an enjoyable film to watch, and a nice way to kill a Sunday afternoon.It's sort of a superhero film, but it stars Melissa McCarthy, so you can probably guess that it is going to be a little more comedic than your typical superhero film (though many of the Marvel films of late have actually been quite funny). It's about these two girls who meet in highschool, one of them wants to become a geneticist and find a way to give people superhuman strength, while the other is basically a drop out that listens to a lot of heavy metal.Anyway, the Earth has been hit by radiation, and it have given psychopaths superpowers, which is pretty problematic because nobody else has them. This is why one of the girls wants to get into genetic research, namely because her parents were killed by one of these miscreants (as they are called), and she wants to continue from where they left off. However, in comes Lydia, who plays around with some knobs, and sits of a chair, and suddenly starts going through a process of giving her superhuman strength.It's fairly typical for a superhero film, though it is rather odd that there doesn't actually seem to be all that many super villains about - only two actually. Well, there is the guy with the crab claws, but he's not quite in the same league as the others. So, to fight these miscreants, they create the Thunder Force, a couple of ladies who also have superhuman powers.As I mentioned, I wouldn't consider it to be incredibly funny, but I've never found McCarthy to be all that funny anyway (though that is generally the case with most American Comedians - they just try too hard to be funny). However, it does have quite a nice feel about it, and I do rather appreciate how it tends to break the norms that you tend to get in Hollywood movies, especially around McCarthy. Look, it isn't going to win any awards, but it certainly isn't as bad as some people have made it out to be."

Do you need to make a movie which is supposed to be a comedy but add all that !@#$ language. This movie would have received a few extra stars from me, but they had to throw in all that language which made it impossible for the little ones to watch. There is no need for the language, it doesn't make the scenes funnier.The other problem with this movie is that while there are some funny scenes, there is no consistency with the characters. From start to finish you would expect to see a steady and normal growth of the characters, but that doesn't happen. It's because the writers or director felt the need to use Deus ex machina rather than put in some extra effort to have characters be themselves.When I see Deus ex machina being used, I know the writers are being lazy. There are several moments in this movie where the writers just said "we give up" and pushed a scene through like a bulldozer through a China shop.This is an OK movie, but it could have been better, way better. It seems they hinted at the end for having another movie, but let us hope they change directors and writers."

That said, I just couldn't generate any genuine hatred for it. It's essentially just a group of friends and family messing about.In a world where enhanced supervillains exist, two school friends drift apart. Decades later, Emily (Octavia Spencer) is a successful scientist working on a way to give powers to the right people, and fight back. Lydia (Melissa McCarthy) has been less successful, but wishes her friendship with Emily had been maintained. On the night of a school reunion, Lydia goes to see Emily at her lab and is accidentally injected with a serum that gives her superhuman strength and resilience. Emily had always planned to be a hero too, so takes the serum also and becomes invisible at will. The pair form a team, THUNDER FORCE, and start to fight back against the villainous forces.I mean, it's rubbish. It's full of performers who can do a lot better, who seemingly agreed to do this so they could hang around with their friends, which is fine. It's not funny or I should say, it's hardly ever funny - occasionally there's some business with Jason Bateman that made me chuckle. His crab based supporting villain turned love interest is, at least, knowing.There's a persuasive awkwardness to the whole endeavour though, never quite sure how deep into parody it's going - but again, I couldn't really come to actively hate it. It doesn't really care that deeply, and neither did I. Never again though."

","If your looking for a movie that does not tug at your heart, and just has fun with itself, then Thunder Force is that movie for you. Melissa McCarthy and Octavia Spencer have such awesome chemistry, and you can clearly see they are having fun making this.In a world populated by supervillains known has Miscreants, twohildhood friends(Melissa McCarthy and Octavia Spencer) developed there own superpowers and become the superhero team known has Thunder Force, in hopes to take them down.An amusing superhero comedy, never tries to be anything more then just a fun film. The rest of the cast do well also, really letting there comic appeal shine through, like Jason Bateman and Bobby Cannavale."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10121392/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","3"," A Bad Unfunny Comedy ","With the Coronavirus pandemic shutting Cinemas worldwide it seems like Netflix have become a force in terms of gaining the rights to films with big stars in it and Thunder Force is no different and I watched it today and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees two former friends both get superpowers and attempt to save Chicago from other superpowered beings.Main Character Melissa McCarthy and Octavia Spencer play the two leads here and its weird, I think both of them are pretty bad in this film but there is no denying they seems to be having fun together and it actually added a bit of energy and life to this pretty generic film. But on their own it doesn't work, Spencer isn't an actress that does comedy much and it clearly shows as she is quite stiff and rigid in her performance which is clearer due to the over the top performance by McCarthy. Now I know Melissa McCarthy can be funny, I have seen her do good work such as Spy and Can you ever forgive me? She just isn't funny here and she needs the right director and project to get that out of her and this film was not it.Supporting Characters Jason Bateman. That is it the best part of this film is Bateman, he plays a half man half crab and he is actually pretty funny. He just adds some quirkiness and ridiculousness of the right kind that really fits and it is just a shame that the others in the film just can't get the same quality out if them. There are some other decent actors such as Bobby Cannavale, Melissa Leo and Pom Klementieff but they are such dull characters and for me it is just a real waste of the talent that the film has and sometimes I wonder why bother casting these big name performers if you aren't going to give them interesting and funny material to work with.Story The story is absurd, but it doesn't embrace it enough. I want to see more superpowered beings for Thunder Force to go up against and it feels like the film either didn't have the budget or weren't creative enough to do that. The film tries to make you care about the characters but I really couldn't as apart from Bateman I just didn't care about the characters or their whole story because the film does nothing to make me care. This film also has something that happens in the last act that really annoyed me because it didn't feel earned and even though this is a comedy I feel like things should at least feel like they fit in the film we are watching.Script The one job of a comedy, make me laugh and this film really failed at that. I maybe smirked a few times but I never laughed as they is no clever comedy here, it is just the most basic of basic attempts to make you laugh and you can easily see right through it. Also the drama doesn't work, it has all been done before and this film isn't good enough for it to get me invested.Style When the action is happening there is no doubt that it can be fun to watch and fitting for a spoof of Superhero films. But I checked and the first time Thunder Force go on a mission is 45 mins into the film, that is unacceptable and by that point I had already clocked out of what the film was trying to achieve.Overall Overall, Thunder Force is a bad comedy. McCarthy is in another comedy stinker and I just think this film lacks any of the qualities that a good comedy needs and unless you love the two leads this is one to avoid."

I watched this a few days ago and while I can remember a chuckle or two and some mildly enjoyable superhero shenanigans, the rest of the movie is a complete blur of forgettable nothing.There's really nothing to recommend here unless you're just a huge McCarthy fan. If you're a fan of her whole thing, this might be a lot of fun for you but other than that I really can't see a whole lot to enjoy or take from this. It just kind of is."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10141026/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","2"," Fake/Biased Ratings, poor acting, amateurish production ","Looking at all the amazing ratings and the remarkable knowledge only insiders would know about this film, it is disappointing to see that the IMDB has now become a terrible source for true film ratings.Within the first 5 minutes of this film, it's clear that it's unfortunately an amateurish class project. There are some Indies which have done tremendous work but this one is just poorly constructed in so many ways and would have benefitted from screen testing with an actualudience.The film opens with an awkwardly acted scene where a mother and daughter are discussing someone of whom the daughter is upset about for reasons unknown. As mom leaves the house to get into her car, daughter is reviewing some writing, notices something, and runs to the front of the house to warn mom -- but her car blows up in an awful CGI fashion and immediately we see daughter lying on the ground, practically out cold. I understand budget limitations but this was so poorly constructed as if you're saying "audience, cut us some slack!"A man laughs in the distance and then enters the house in yet another awkward D-movie fashion moment lacking all continuity and suspense, and he's looking for someone in the house. Daughter is hiding and suspense scene of him looking is cut short quickly. Immediate cut to night time where daughter is sitting outside the house after this tragedy - as you'd expect after your mother was blown up in a car several hours earlier, LOL, with a notebook.... huh? On it, she then writes in big letters REVENGE!This is nigh unwatchable and the fake reviews are as annoying. I'll give it an extra star for the effort. I'll give it an extra star for trying to make a film on the low budget but the real problem isn't the money. A courtroom scene in a courtroom has a witness is not only exceedingly dark, but doesn't even use the courtroom properly which anyone watching Law & Order could figure out. The overacting is atrocious. That scene cuts to the next in a restaurant which goes from bright lighting to, again, a very darkly lit scene. I'm not sure how nobody noticed this.I'll describe the last scene 20 minutes in before I had to stop watching. It's supposedly the attorney speaking to a group of... thugs? Huh? Then one of them speaks up and wants to know if any of them should be taking orders from a guy with a "corny cartoon character's name". Who talks like this? The attempts to be funny and clever are so flat.This is a great film to show young directors and producers the value of having an audience review your work and how budget constraints should not be used as an excuse for poorly constructed work that just doesn't convince an audience. Don't try to create a feature film unless you can at least do the simple stuff right."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10152736/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," Kangana Ranaut and Arvind Swami rocks but the movie Sucks because of non-cinematic & unconventional life of Jayalalithaa. ","Thalaivii (2021) : Movie Review -While looking at any biopic, i always seek for inspiring tales and socially-challenging characters. To be frank, a star's life or any politician's struggle is not what i find fit for it. Instead, i would love to know the story of an underdog who has done tremendous work in his life or someone whom i can call legend in that field. Jayalalithaa's life can be viewed in two parts, one is her film career and second is her political career. In Thalaivii, the writers have tried their best to trim it and settle down for 150 minutes or so, but have failed considerably to understand the cinematic perspectives of the story. Her pre-political life looks so cold, dry and soulless and that unconventional affair/love story with MGR never found any ethical meaning. Thalaivii will take you into a boredom in the first half but fortunately the second half is powerful so, it becomes an Average Watch overall.The film is about Actress and Politician Jayalalithaa and her career, love, struggle, fights and almost everything any masala script can promise. Actually, the problem appears in the unconventional life of her by the time it starts looking conventional, it's too late. The first is about her film career, her bonding with her mother and her love affair with Superstar MGR who is already married twice. I don't see how that makes too much sense to showcase unethical character like this with so much of proud? Let her political career be the reason to be proudly presented. And that foeship with RM Veerappan was damn too outdated. The same script could have been crafted better and then i might have felt the greatness of her character. However, i had feelings for her in the second half and even though it was lot more dramatic than needed, i still quite had tears at couple of occasions.Kangana Ranaut as Jayalalithaa an actress is not that good but as a Politician, she has nailed it. Those early days of her career didn't have much varities so i can't blame Kangana for looking Kangana only on screen. Later, in the second half Kangana gets those varities and blossoms like a matured actress. Arvind Swami as MGR looks like MGR, especially with that white Cap and Black Goggle. His accent sounded little dull here and there but otherwise he is fantastic. Raj Arjun plays RMV and what an amazing act he present. Though, his character sucks big time, he as actor never looked out of it. The supporting cast is okay, nothing too great nor too bad.Thalaivii is stretched by the songs which were necessary for the commercial purpose but doesn't really leave an impact. That Bharatnatyam song was grand and lavish but the audio sounded underwhelming. Dialogues are fine, sometimes dramatic but mass oriented where one can clap and scream. The screenplay is terribly slow in the first half but better in the second half. Vijay's attempt to glorify Jayalalithaa's life on screen might please her die hard fans but for neutral audience and classes, this story has got nothing much interesting. Those people can watch it only and only for Kangana and Arvind's performance, rest strictly Average.RATING - 5/10*"

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10152736/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Kangana's Thalaivii is worth a watch. ","Thalaivii review :After Bellbottom last week, here's another theatrical release coming to OTT in just two weeks. I guess no one is willing to risk the theatres yet so this kind of hybrid format will continue for sometime.As for Thalaivii, it is a well executed biopic on the heroine turned Chief Minister Jayalalitha tracing her incredible journey from a novice to a winner. Its way ahead of the web-series Queen released on MX Player last year.Kangana Ranaut playing the titular role, delivers yet another knockout performance. The Roja (1992) pair - Arvind Swami and Madhoo - play Mr and Mrs. MGR. Arvind is truly the surprise package of the film and his resemblance to the real MGR lends a realistic touch to the pivotal character. The movie sequences between him and Kangana are sure to generate nostalgia amongst the MGR- Jaya fans. Nasser is impressive as ever playing MGR's friend turned foe Karunanidhi.Finally, Thalaivii is worth your time and money. It has splendid performances and an inspiring story to tell...Dont miss!!P. S. After watching Thalaivii, I would recommend Mani Ratnam's Iruvar (1997) to those who haven't seen it yet. It will complete the Jaya saga perfectly.Regards, Sumeet Nadkarni."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10152736/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Decent Movie ","Review By Kamal KTamil Nadu is one of the states where cinema and politics blend comfortably and Jayalalitha is one such flamboyant personalities who has left a trail of bright dots in both these fields.The movie starts off with Jayalalitha's Paanchali Shabadam and then traces back to her entry into movies,her intimacy with MGR and how she carved her way into a Male dominated political structure.If we go through the journey of Jayalalitha, it is RESILIENCE written in bold all over it and who else better than (Kangana Ranaut) can be rightful for this role.And for the bountiful of talent that Arvind Swamy is,its never too difficult for him to play any role.If Dulqer as Gemini Ganesan in Mahanati left a lasting impreession ,then Arvind Swamy as MGR too left a perennial impact.Samudrakani played the possessive confidante of MGR with poise.Karunandhi's rationalism, atheism and his literary prowess hasn't been explored much as his role was very confined.The writers didn't delve too much into a lot of other incidents and other important characters like the enigmatic Sasikala's as this movie ends with Jayalalitha taking oath as Chief Minister for the first time and her subservient MLA's bowing down to her which has now become a common scene in Tamil Nadu's political space.At the end,this movie leaves you only wanting for more as there's lot that could've been told."

I think Kangana will win her 5th National Award with this in the next year. In the supporting cast I loved Raj Arjun. Dialogues were another strongest point of this film.

"," Thalaivii, Now On Netflix, Is A Terrible Ode To A Cultural Superstar ","I do not need to know about the history of Tamil politics and Tamil cinema to tell you that Thalaivii is an objectively terrible film. A dramatized take on the rise of six-time Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J. Jayalalithaa - from professional actress to conflicted lover to 'mother' of the masses - the film doesn't suffer from an identity crisis so much as an all-out quality crisis. Context is irrelevant when a primitive form of storytelling hijacks the guise of masala movie-making. When did masala become so unpalatable? I thought the whole point of entertainment was to adapt and engage, not regress into a time capsule of bland montages, kindergarten-level writing, simplistic staging and meta-awful acting. The Hindi version, now streaming on Netflix, is likely worse because of the obvious cultural dissonance. Sometimes, mediocrity transcends language and taste barriers. For this, I'm eternally grateful to titles like Thalaivii. It makes my job easier.Read the full review on Film Companion."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10152736/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Kangana Ranaut & Arvind Swamy Pay A Resounding Ode To Jaya-MGR's Poignant Love Story !!! ","An iconic figure in Indian politics, Jayalalithaa's political journey is known to most. Director Vijay attempts to unravel her icy cold persona and look at her as a woman passionately driven by love. Make no mistake, a woman's fight for self respect and battle against patriarchy are integral to the story. However, what lies at the heart of the tale is her unconditional love for MGR, despite the societal contempt of her. She faced the wrath of his loyal followers, who deemed their extra marital relationship as illicit and a disgrace to his noble reputation. As days turned into decades, they became each other's strength and weakness. Bound by the heart, the purity of their love stayed intact even as murky politics, power struggle and people got hellbent on parting the two. The scenes where they indulge in phone conversations without uttering a single word but letting their silence do the talking are heartbreaking. The film essentially works for its poignant love story.Perceived as the 'other woman' in MGR's life, who got things easy for being his blue eyed girl, Jaya had everything but respect at the beginning of her political career. Despite being cornered and humiliated time and again, she marches on with her head held high. Her relentless fight to earn her place in the society forms the crux of the film.Kangana in the titular role channels her inner rebel and unflinching self assurance to make a point - she plays second fiddle to no one. A classic case of her screen character imitating her real life in a way. She renders a powerful portrayal of a lovelorn woman who keeps rising like a phoenix from the ashes. She elevates the formulaic script with quiet determination and powerful presence, cleverly not mimicking Jaya but getting the tone and nuances of her character right. As a woman scorned by people for loving fearlessly and feeling deeply, Kangana is outstanding.The actress finds a perfect companion in Arvind Swami as MGR, her mentor, the wind beneath her wings. He brings in a certain calm to the storm that engulfs Jaya. Swami is impeccable in his mannerisms and body language. There couldn't have been a better actor to play the Tamil screen icon and people's leader.Dialogues are painstakingly written and hit the right note. "Mahabharat ka dusra naam jaya hai" sums up Jaya's life perfectly. In a scene where Jaya tells her ailing mother that people only remember you when they need you, her mother righty argues, "Bina Matlab ke log bhagwaan ko bhi yaad nahi karte." When Jaya is told that everyone reveres MGR and that she is no different, she says, "Krishna ko sab pasand karte the, phir bhi Radha ki sab mein ginti nahi hoti." Neeta Lulla's costumes are detailed and effective. From conical bras of the 60s and 70s to the winged eye makeup, bouffant and vintage props, the recreation of a bygone era is decent if not specific.Thailaivii pays a resounding ode to Jaya-MGR's poignant love story, a relationship without labels. The political aspect feels talky, half baked and one-sided. What eventually stays with you is the story of a woman who defied the odds and wrote her own destiny."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10152736/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," Kangana Ranuat will definitely get 5th National Award for Thalavi! ","Smt. J. Jayaylaitha popularly know as AMMA will be so proud of everyone who made this film possible.Shardhanjali first of all.Second, why this movie got low rating just 6/10, isn't just a about Kangana Ranuat's haters but Amma haters also.I wrote in the beginning that she was honoured with AMMA title. Amma is widely know in North India as Mother or Ma or Muma. She was that. She had a grip that was unending.Till now I think something related to my work life, whenever I'm in a dilemma, I do remember her.Coming back to this movie which apparently number 1 in Netflix is in itself vouch that people do appreciate AMMA and the character of Kangana Ranuat.Coming to the movie, I didn't think for just a fraction that the one performing the role was Ms. Ranuat. She did perform the role as AMMA. I was really in sync with her acting and her putting weight was the highlight for me. MGR, Karunanidhi and Ganesan did good job.If you check my history, I normally don't give any movie 10 ratings but this film is something different."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10152736/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Kangana plays Jayalalitha well in this biopic ","This movie can be best described as a political biography and is therefore different from a conventional film in the sense there is no villain, no comedian, no vamp etc etc. Those having an interest in politics of South India and having knowledge of the political and personal lives of Jayalalitha and MGR may like this movie. ( In the movie MGR is made MJR and DMK is made TMK). Also they are best qualified to comment whether the movie does justice to personalities of the characters or to the events depicted. Since I do not belong to this category, I can only evaluate how well the film is made from the script available.The movie has a slow narrative with few exciting moments in between as it unravels the events as they took place. There are the usual games of dirty politics and the changing power equations. Two scenes stand out. One where Jayalalitha is man handled and molested in the assembly and second at MGR's funeral where she is not allowed inside.The movie provides a great opportunity for Kangana Ranaut to showcase her talent as she essays the role of a brave lady who by sheer ambition and grit rises from a film actress to the level of the state chief minister. All this as she braves all odds to make a prominent place for herself in the male dominated political field. She is humiliated in the assembly, vows vengeance, fights for her self respect and faces the anger of MGR's followers due to her extra marital affair with him. Arvind Swamy as MGR has also played his character well and the make up has helped him considerably. Their love for each other has been shown nicely with some delicately presented scenes.The movie may be found heavy and lacking in entertainment by some audiences due the nature of the storyline and the absence of conventional box office trappings."

The whole thing is about the superficiality of appearance with the emphasis on fancy clothing and casting attractive performers in the lead roles, but of course on the other side of that you get extremely shallow characters and stilted acting. Cinderella has been given a feminist spin in that she's now a successful fashion designer in her own right, but they also prolong feminine stereotypes by doing that. How about making her a master builder? James Corden continues to be the kiss of death for everything he appears in, and the only interesting songs are covers. Not a recommended film."

It is mostly funny, at times absurd, with elaborate production numbers.The biggest divergence is both the prince and Ella are, in different ways, reluctant to accept the traditional roles. He isn't sure he really wants to follow his father as King, she isn't sure she wants to be a wife of a King, maybe being a dress designer would be more fulfilling.Right after release on Amazon streaming this movie has received lots of unjustified, very negative reviews.

Am I the only person left alive who is fed up being shouted at by Edina Menzel? Pierce Brosnan demonstrated in "Mamma Mia" (2008) that he is happy to play parts with his tongue in his cheek, but here I fear he must have cringed when he saw; likewise Minnie Driver and a whole host of British comedians led by the ubiquitously un-talented James Corden. Billy Porter tries a different take on the fairy godmother character but features all to sparingly to make much impact on an otherwise extremely pedestrian interpretation that reached it's nadir with the cute but totally wooden pairing of Nicholas Galitzine (Freddie Mercury would spin in his grave) and Camila Cabello. Sorry, maybe if I were 6 years old and had nothing to compare this with, I'd not be so harsh - but I'm not and this is poor, really poor..."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10155932/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," only Porter brings the magic ","Greetings again from the darkness. In keeping with the times, writer-director Kay Cannon (the screenwriter for three PITCH PERFECT movies) has turned the classic and ancient Cinderella tale into an agenda movie, albeit one adorned with new and lively adaptations of popular songs. The earliest versions of the folk tale date back 2000 years, while the most widely-accepted fairy tale version was penned by 17th century French writer Charles Perrault, who also wrote "Little Red Riding Hood" and "Sleeping Beauty". Since then, there have been countless renditions around the globe in various forms: literary, stage, musical theatre, TV, and animated and live action film. As far as I can tell, this is the first feminist take.Opening with the town folks performing Janet Jackson's "Rhythm Nation", we are then introduced to Ella (pop singer Camila Cabello in her first movie), who lives in the basement of her stepmother's (Idina Menzel) home. Yes, Ella has two stepsisters, although neither are particularly wicked. In fact, Anastasia (Maddie Baillio) appears almost disinterested, while Drizella (Charlotte Spencer) is at times, downright hilarious (in a Leslie Mann kind of way). Even the stepmother has moments of respectability and decency with Ella.Ella's only friends are the three mice who also live in the basement. It's here where she hones her talent as a dress designer and dreams of having her own business ("how hard can it be?"). For her, she sees fashion design as not just her way out of the basement, but more importantly, as her road to independence. She doesn't need a man or anyone else, and is skilled in daily affirmations. Hers is less of a 'dream' and more of a goal, despite the challenges of her situation.Of course this is still a Cinderella story, and Nicholas Galitzine plays Prince Robert, an unfocused young man who lacks the drive to be king and fulfill the ultimate wish of his father, King Rowan (Pierce Brosnan). On the other hand, Robert's sister, Princess Gwen (Tallulah Greive) is both driven and filled with ideas on ways to improve the kingdom. Her father readily dismisses her from matters of importance (men things), while Queen Beatrice (Minnie Driver) initially tries to maintain peace in the family. Knowing that this is a musical, and seeing Pierce Brosnan's name in the credits, might generate nightmarish flashbacks for those who experienced his singing in MAMMA MIA! (2008). While he does tease/threaten us with singing, most of his musical bits are quite tongue-in-cheek.Bringing a jolt of energy to the story at a time when it's desperately needed is Billy Porter as Ella's non-binary Fabulous Godmother, known as Fab G. Porter's costume and overall flamboyance are a hoot to watch, and oh by the way, he's quite a singer as well. And yes, the three mice turn into coachmen played by James Corden, James Acaster, and Romesh Ranganathan. They do serve up some comic relief, but likely not as much as they or the filmmaker hopes. Surprisingly, the set design and costume design are fairly drab - the two exceptions being Porter and the ball.In addition to the opening "Rhythm Nation" song, you'll hear a version of Salt-N-Pepa's "What a Man", as well as other familiar tunes. The music and the shift in Ella's approach are the contemporary touches, as the girl-power theme stresses there's no need for a man ... even a Prince. The twist on the Cinderella tale varies from previous versions, the most popular being Kenneth Branagh's 2015 film with Lily James and Cate Blanchett, the 1997 film with Whitney Houston as the Fairy Godmother, and of course, Walt Disney's 1950 animated classic. Ms. Cannon's version is still a love story; it's just love of one's self and career, rather than the love of another person. A tale perfectly suited to the times.In select theaters and on Amazon Prime beginning September 3, 2021."

",""Cinderella" is a Comedy - Family movie in which we watch the classic story of Cinderella but in a modern musical way. Cinderella has her own big dreams that she wants to succeed but her godmother has different plans for her.I have to admit that I did not have high expectations from this movie so, I was not disappointed by it. The plot was mostly the same as in all the previous "Cinderella" movies that exist while the direction which was made by Kay Cannon failed to create something different or even new except the modern songs that already existed. The interpretations of Camila Cabello who played as Cinderella, Nicholas Galitzine who played as Prince Robert, Pierce Brosnan who played as King Rowan and Minnie Driver who played as Queen Beatrice were below average and did not succeed on making the difference and save this movie. All in all, I have to say that "Cinderella" is a below average comedy musical and I do not recommend anyone to watch it because I do not want you to waste your time as I did."

I don't talk about casting choices or changes to characters and the like but the execution of the whole affair - the tone is all wrong, the humor feels forced and generic, the whole thing feels like something made up in one day and than filmed in one or two days + post production by the special effects guys. But one thing they got right: the producers achieved to put almost every imaginable modern cliche in this movie. And last but not least, the songs are, well, lets be tender, mucho improvable. Why Pierce Brosnan got involved into this mess (the Mamma Mia movies are Oscar material compared), I don't understand. One of the worst Cinderellas I ever witnessed.Last note: sometimes I suspect, the producers believe their own fake reviews ;)"

You have a girl who is abused after father dies and the step mother takes over, and the two step sisters are mean also.The ball comes along and Cinderella gets to go because the fairy godmother uses magic to send her in a beautiful gown and in a pumpkin carriage. There is the glass slippers, and the wedding at the end.You can change stuff to a certain extent but when you cross over those boundaries then it stops being Cinderella. This movie takes too many liberties and too much creative license with the story. For example:Cinderella has a step mother that isn't cruel, she's just missed out on her dream as a pianist and it's all because of a male world. (bs)Cinderella doesn't want to marry the prince. Instead she want's to make dresses, and has an opportunity to travel the world with a Queen from another country. (bs)The mice who are turned in to footmen joke about having to take a pee out of their "front tail". (totally not needed)There is no pumpkin, just a crate which turns in to a carriage and two horses. (meh)The fairy godmother isn't a godmother. (this is ok, but don't call him a fairy godmother).The prince doesn't want to be king and wants to travel the world with Cinderella, not married, but as love interests. (meh)Instead the Princess wants to be King, is corrected by the mother that she would be Queen. (meh)There are other changes which I did not like, but most of all I thought the movie missed the mark. It was sort of like 'Ella Enchanted and they even had the same Queen songs. It had a good cast, but I blame the director and the writer (all the same persons) for the mistakes.This is not Cinderella. Don't call it as such."

This time its Camila Cabello who gets to put on the glass slippers. Also starring with Camila Cabello is Minnie Driver, Idina Menzel,Billy Porter, Nicolas Galtinze,and Pierce Brosnan.

Things turn around though as Ella meets Prince Robert (Nicolas) at the marketplace who becomes smitten with Ella.Will Ella's dreams come true and will she win the heart of the prince. Overall I found this film to be pointless. Here are my pros and cons.Pros Camila was funny in this film and I hope she stars in more films in the future.Billy Porter(who is only in it for barely 10 mins) stoked the entire film for me. I even loved the song Shining Star.Nicolas and Camila had great chemistry The whole not marrying the prince in the end took me by surprise.Cons Jukebox songs didn't fit the film at all as it was pointless(oh yeah did i forget to mention this resembles Ella Enchanted).Crier raps Pierce Brosnan can't sing Stepsisters way too nice.Princess Gwen(Robert's sister) was pointless.However there is a few tweaks like Cinderella not marrying Robert yet and Robert's sister becomes the next ruler as well as Idina Menzel getting a solo song called Dream Girl and the fairy godmother is a man instead of a woman.Stick to the 2015 one instead."

Once upon a time, Disney nailed this with a wonderfully animated masterpiece full of whimsy and magic. Now we get this mashed up, sloppy mess to slog through. The songs all feel forced and out of place, like the person in charge of song selection just picked out a bunch of songs they liked and then threw them all over the timeline of this film whether they make any sense or not. We get like three rise up/empowerment songs in the first 20 minutes, a love song about 30 seconds after Cinder and the Prince meet and a few too many reprises.But hey, it's a musical, so the music has to at least be good ri- NOPE! 99% of the songs feel so off because it's painfully obvious they weren't sung anywhere near the moment but rather were recorded in a studio and then later layered on top of all the lip synchs. I get that doing songs during shoots could be tough but they could've at least tried a little to make it sound better and more accurate. Got Cinderella running and jumping all over the place while singing and her tone never changes in the slightest and you can feel that.The characters are classics, pre-written for the movie with years of history and background to pull from. They still mess it up. Motivations are sloppy and muddled. Character growth happens in fits and spurts rather than feeling like there's any sort of progression. The prince goes from a perma-bachelor bro to in love with Cinder in no time at all for something completely stupid (that would've gotten her imprisoned as well). Cinderella rarely feels like the downtrodden, put upon sister we all know her to be. Instead she's got a couple of mildly annoying step-sisters but don't worry! Rather than dealing with them she'll spend her time in this surprisingly large and fairly stylish basement/dress making area. There's only one or two times she really seems all that put upon and they feel so shocking that, once again, it draws me out of the film.The only redeeming factors, to me, were the mice, Idina Menzel and the fairy "godmother." The mice added a nice little splash of comedy but were hit and miss at times. Idina Menzel brought he spectacular pipes to show and she belts out some stunning notes throughout this that really showed off the difference between pop star and stage star. Then we have Billie Porter as the Fabulous Godmother. While I don't love the character, I really appreciate how Porter was just going for it. It was clear he was having fun in the role and that's what this really needed.Cinderella is a mess. It's tone deaf, confused about it's message, poorly written, poorly paced and as much as I can appreciate anachronisms in film when done right, these are not. The random influx of modern terminology and jokes feels so out of place in this setting and when coupled with the clash of empowering and degrading women it just doesn't work. Even the big finale was telegraphed to the point that as soon as we meet a certain character I looked at the friend I was watching it with and we both immediately called the ending of this. This is not worth watching the actual movie for. If anything, wait a little bit until the scenes are all available on youtube and just look up Menzel and Porter's moments. The rest of this is just a waste of a classic property."

She loves to design dresses and even has her own workplace in her basement, where a crew of merry mice (James Corden, Romesh Ranganathan, James Acaster) watch over her. It is her dream is to open up a dress shop in the town marketplace; however, in her kingdom, women cannot run businesses. When Prince Robert (Nicholas Galitzine), the unassuming heir apparent, lays eyes on Ella, he falls head over heels in love with her, as does she for him. However, as Cinderella and Prince Robert find themselves and their paths in life, a series of decisions they must take puts their love story in jeopardy. There are lots of subplots and side stories in the film, but that's the main plotline.Cinderella maintains a steady and engaging pace with just enough action, comedy, romance and drama throughout the nearly two-hour duration. As it's told through a combination of songs and dialogue, it's only logical that the cast is comprised of a mixture of singers, actors, and comedians. Camila Cabello, Billy Porter and Idina Menzel "slay" in the film, as Porter's character (Ella's fairy godparent) would say. Their delivery is clear and, in the case of Cabello and Menzel, though a lot of the film's soundtrack is comprised of remakes (like Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation); it's refreshing to hear their take on the songs. Pierce Brosnan plays the stately, confident, yet flawed and patriarchal King Rowan and Minnie Driver acts as his strong, regal Queen Beatrice. I love the portrayal of strong women in the film. Beatrice, Ella and even Vivian have one thing in common - they are restricted by their society. Vivian had to give up on her passion; Beatrice must sit silently next to her husband for life; and Ella is at risk of losing her dreams. It's certainly unique to see this struggle in a fairy tale film. Shot at Pinewood Studios in the UK, the film's sets are impeccable, and I truly felt I was in a medieval kingdom with the characters.Cinderella promotes advocating for yourself, pushing against restrictive gender roles, following your dreams, choosing your own destiny and so many more positive messages! There are only one or two uses of mild profanity in this film.I give Cinderella 5 out of 5 stars and recommend this for ages 11 to 18, plus adults. Reviewed by Eshaan M., KIDS FIRST!"

(It was a pure recognition of the incomparable talent that is Idina Menzel!) The final musical number is pure joy!

I enjoyed a few minutes here and there (with Billy Porter and the mice - James Acaster, James Corden, and Romesh Ranganathan) all be it -what - 5 minutes of the film? Yikes.I was just looking at Cinderella the lead character as she was. She's treated like crap, got ashes on her face, we know the child is abused no matter how they tell the story. Having a dress store when the idea is to KEEP her away from people - okay, nice touch but it just didn't work as it should have. Placing that aside, this Cinderella did not move me to make me feel for her to 'rise above' it at all.There's so much here gone South - this 'Ella' was quite annoying, the Prince was a yawn - I wanted to propel him from the kingdom my self - I hated Ella's ball dress, etc., etc. And there's no way in Hades I saw Idina Menzel as the wicked Stepmom. Cate Blanchett set that bar kinda high in a modern remake of Cinderella a few years ago and -- to me she woulda made a better Queen in this with a better script and musical numbers. And let me not get on the "musical numbers" - hack-hack-cough! The "nod" to the Hamilton-esque ball announcer COULD have been a great addition with the right script and..the musicians REALLY PLAYED THE INSTRUMENTS that were represented in the song. Sorry, that I noticed and it stuck out to me like a sore thumb.It's not the WORST adaptation of Cinderella, but it just didn't grab you as it was hyped up to do and the differences were just not that engaging enough."

I loved every second of it, the characters were vibrant and it was teeming with life and the lady who created all this really fashioned some fine back and forth banter and the music and the magic and the fun and clever everything plus the themes were wholly universal and incredible and I loved every second of it!

However, the closer this got to the end, the more it became evident this movie teaches children modernist, feminist, socio-political me-ism and downgrades marriage as a valid institution. "Why put a label on it?" I'll tell you why: because love warrants a firm foundation, not a sloppy "until I get tired of you" attitude.I understand they were trying to update the fairy-tale story of Cinderella... but they took that concept too far. I have no problem with the Hispanic Cinderella; the main actress could not have been cuter. The supporting actors were enjoyable in their parts. Until they hit the last half hour or so, I found it enjoyable. Then it just turned stupid.Flash to the writers and directors: You can get married and still accomplish your life's goals. If someone is going to be selfish and pursue their dreams in exclusion to everything else, let them do so alone. Love isn't about selfishness and self-fulfillment; it's about forming a partnership. There's your socio-political statement, but with some common-sense added to it.Currently this movie has a rating of 4, and deserves it. It sends the wrong message to children, twists the original story to the point of being unrecognizable (a WOODEN CRATE instead of a pumpkin? Are they serious? What blockhead came up with that concept? Surely they could have come up with something funnier and more interesting).I did enjoy a lot of the music, but the movie had some of the worst choreography we've seen in some time. If the "morals" of this story is what the modern world is about... maybe humanity is due for a major wake-up call. I would not take a child of any age to see this movie. These aren't the kind of morality and ethics I'd wish to teach children... and it's not the director's privilege to try to mold children's minds. One does get tired of having someone's personal agendas shoved down our throats through "children's movies"."

Buckner) a PTSD vet with mounds of cleavage. Her sister is forced to take the drug by street thugs and dies seconds later. Not very good for repeat business. Len Bias lasted longer. Sarah takes revenge.The sound was horribly muddled throughout the whole film. The acting and fighting appear to have been inspired from Dolemite movies. It was that bad and funny and not in a good way. The aunt going into the bar and beating up the guys had me laughing out loud. The film was "so bad it is good" at times..Guide: F-word.

And I opted to sit down to watch it, without ever having heard about the movie.As I didn't know what I was in for here, then writers Trey McIntosh and Robert D. Parham had every opportunity to win me over and impress me with "Snow Black".Except they failed to do so in every aspect. The storyline told in "Snow Black" was just bland, and it was not helping the movie one bit that the dialogue felt like it was written by someone in an elementary theater class. Needless to say that the acting was every bit as dubious as the storyline was. And then there was the action sequences, which were executed with the grace of a beached whale.The movie was just swathed in a sense of it being inferior and unrealistic. I mean, the way that the armed forces were represented and behaving, well that was just laughable.I am sure that there is an audience out there for a movie such as "Snow Black". I just happened not to be in that particular target audience.My rating of director Robert D. Parham's "Snow Black" lands on a one out of ten stars."

If Mexico is willing to give them asylum, the insanity of hunting and killing them as they attempt to reach the southern border seems a bit inane. Clearly this is a film that is attempting to make a statement about modern prejudices, but the metaphor wasn't complete.

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10160974/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","3"," Slow paced and without much magic... ","When I sat down to watch the 2021 movie "Witch Hunt", I must admit that I was expecting more in the horror department from writer and director Elle Callahan. But instead I found myself in for a political horror of sorts.The storyline told in "Witch Hunt" definitely was one that failed to entertain me in a memorable way. Sure, the movie was watchable, but I found the storyline to be rather uneventful and slow paced. There was just simply too little happening of any worth throughout the course of the movie, so I wasn't particularly entertained.And while the movie does have a good cast ensemble, with the likes of Elizabeth Mitchell and Lulu Antariksa on the cast list, then the storyline was just an anchor around their ankles, holding them back.There is a little bit of CGI involved in the movie, as there is a dash of witchcraft actually to be seen in the movie. Sure, the effects were good, but I must admit for a movie that was based on witchcraft, then I was expecting more in the magic department. But I guess that the movie's title was referring more to the thing when people run a campaign against someone because of their opinions, views or beliefs, and not really actual magical witchcraft.Regardless, then "Witch Hunt" was a movie that fell short of providing me with wholehearted entertainment. And as such, then my rating of writer and director Elle Callahan's 2021 movie lands on a mere three out of ten stars."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10160974/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," extraordinary from witchita... ","Or whatever. If youre interested in the magical properties of the witch then do as the grumpy old man, tiptoeing rather than stumbled into it by coincidence, and wasnt dissapointed at all. Its a mysterious thriller horror movie about a phenomenon that the highbrowed would call genocide, or pursuing, convicting and/or exterminating people because they are different than the rule of correctness, in this case girls/women with magical abilities.To draw comparative historical events one can mention the inquisition, and other religious persecution, as the muslims of yougoslavia, the jews of europa( holocaust/progroma) or just because one looks a tiny bit different like the tribalistic genocide of rwanda.This film is thank heavens just fictional, but has loads of caracter of reality. So therefore it might scare some youngsters of the cellphones and may prevent spread of rumour, and may make some people feel the desperation when your situation is dire and you cant change the fact that it is just so.Well its a good fantasy film, wellmade and filled with the magics you might expect, some incoherence there are, and flashbacks that may make you wonder if the editor has become bewitched. Also a better backstory for the feverish hunt and unveiling of the doomed women in this society is absent, maybe the will make a prolouge-story as a sequele, cause this was really good.Playtime is spot on, score amplifies tension and the acting is aalreit, therefore either you are the hunter or the hunted, the grumpy old man is still smoldering, writing ''recommended'' in the ashes."

What???? NO!The film is horror the way it's meant to be. It's got a traditional old horror movie feel to it, not much gore, no CGI and a lot of psychological. A film set in a dystopian society where witches (women mostly with red hair) are hunted by the system, from a young age, it seems, A depressing and scary notion. A widowed woman and her kids live in an isolated house (almost really as they do have a next door neighbour that is a bit nosey) and they seem normal but... The film has a number of spooky moments, tension and also fear. A really good horror for 2021.

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10160974/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","1"," Avoid ","Its movies like this that make me wonder how somethings get approved and some don't. I'm sure the writer/director meant well, you can get a gist of the political undertones it tries to convey. But it never really gets any job done. Its neither a good allegory or witch movie. Never tense, nor happy. It just drones along. Anytime you expect some sort of explanation, you're left empty save for a few miss-and-you'll-be-lost lines near the end. Fresh of watching this, the only thing magic was how it made 30-minutes feel like an hour. At best this should have been a concept for someone to pick up and fleshed out.None of the faults should be laid of the actors/resses or crew, they all did their jobs, and did it to the best of their ability.Avoid. Honestly, I see movies as art at 24-frames-per-second, and try not to dismiss another person's vision because art is subjective. This was terrible, even for my low standards.If the writer sees my comment, I think you should work on this idea! There is something here, the trailer brought me too it, the initial idea is promising. Flesh out the world and story. A modern day world with witches is a good pitch."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10160974/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Entertaining! ","Why are people dogging this movie? It has a fully fleshed-out concept with good character development and acting. The main actor explores a lot of emotions as she comes of age and faces danger and the law. So it ties some current events as themes in its fantasy story.... So what!The movie has multiple plot lines and depth. They used their budget well and the pacing is solid. The effects are cool and the witchiness is mysterious and frowned upon by the scared normals. It's kind of like the early X-Men movies in this regard.I watch all types of movies (mostly horror and drama) and this kept my interest. It also has a cool old American style with all the furniture and cars. People have this stuff and smartphones, MacBooks, etc.I was entertained by this."

","I am really tired of any yahoo coming into movies and just throwing 1's and 2's out because they can't get past a message they may not agree with. For one movies are meant to challenge your views and also speak about matters through art. As any art does.Also! Horror has ALWAYS had its political messages you insanely vapid whiners. If you don't like horror then go watch an action film. There are loads of them.First off the acting is not as bad as people are saying. Does it have a message that mirrors today. Yeah it does and it does a pretty damn good job of mirroring it. Which probably makes these 1 star rater madder than hell. Too bad. Find a safe space Jethro.I think this will definitely resonate with people who aren't into period pieces. As I'm not much for them. This modern take is a bit on the feminine empowerment side. So if the thought of woman being strong bothers you. Go watch Steven Segal. But to be fair. Though it wasn't for me directly I still thought it was a thoughtful and sweet way to tell a story. Plus it's shot well and has a lot of moving parts in the film than just a straight message about current politics. It has like 3 stories or 3 sub genres woven together. Definitely a bit more unique than I thought it was gonna be.Much more of an indie film exceeding it's financial restraints by story and ideas alone. Which I admire. I'd say about 6 & 1/2 to 7 for me. I didn't feel I wasted my time at all."

Which does to lead to a 'gotcha' ending.Odd minions appear through out and there is a winged tyrannosaur in one scene but no real set pieces, stuntwork or nudity, this is not an action packed feature.In and of itself this film doesn't jokingly turn in a non-effort, it's surprisingly consistent, everyone puts in a bit of work but there are times some people seem a little lost in the greenscreen landscape.This isn't a black tanktop kind of film just a low geared somewhat awkward film.5 out 10/3.5 out 5 stars for neutrality's sake.

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10165918/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," Is it giving in or giving up? It's us or them, in an excellent exercise in tension. ","SEEN AT SCREAMFEST 2021, LOS ANGELESWhile many directors play it safe by giving us films that contain similar aspects (particularly in big budget films), Michael Mongillo's films over the past 20 years have proven to each be a different beast, making each one a new idea. The Changed is a welcome addition to that line. Though people will make comparisons to Invasion Of The Body Snatchers and countless other films in that style, Mongillo does a nice approach of paring things down and making it more personal by containing most of the story in a home, creating claustrophobia, which helps build the story and ratchet up the tension to such a level that the viewers will feel their own fear and dread. This is a fresh approach to the home seige scenario. While other reviews are more specific in revealing the specifics, I'm going to hold back just enough to let the surprises pull you in when you view it.The introductions to the three main characters is conceptually fascinating. Mac, Jane, and Kim are each first seen center positioned in their frame, with another character entering and ever so slightly igniting your suspicions as the three are also realizing something has been subtly going on for nearly a month by then.Kim (Clare Foley of SINISTER) conveys a believable sense of loss even before her suspicions of things going awry are validated. Coming from a troubled home life and socially awkward situation of lack of friends, her already existing helplessness either has her able to keep her sanity or slowly just letting go and giving in to the threat. It keeps you wondering, and worrying for her. Married couple Mac and Jane (Jason Alan Smith and Carlee Avers, reunited from Mongillo's DIANE) each experience increasing strangeness from co-workers, as well as a bizarre morning chat between Mac and neighbor Bill (Tony Todd of another claustrophobic horror NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD - 1990). When new neighbor Sara jogs by (Olivia Freer) and stops to chat with Bill as he's leaving, her glances over at Mac made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. While that wasn't horrifying, my body told me this was going to get weird. Jane's experience at work escalates quickly, then the nightmare truly begins.While the three converge at Mac and Jane's home, Kim's gruff uncle Kurt (Doug Tompos) arrives and adds to the tension that's already strong. As the threat of something taking over the population closes in on the four trapped in the house, with Bill and Sara equally being representatives -- ambassadors? -- of the Change and seductively trying to convince the four that this new consciousness is the best for all. Is it a virus? Is it aliens? Is it a cult of mass brainwashing?THE CHANGED doesn't try to wow you with big nor gooey CGI special effects and big shiny Hollywood antics. Mongillo's approach is more direct, with dialogue that keeps you paying attention and keeping you on edge as things start snowballing, which is basically right away and just keeps getting more intense as it goes along. That's quite a feat, and a film that will linger in your mind. As Michael Mongillo creates more films, it will be interesting to see which different beast (or "Michael Mongillo Conspiracy") comes next. I'll be looking forward to owning one on disc in the future for my special collection."Nothing in lie that's worthwhile is easy. It is the struggle and the fight that makes us who we are.""
