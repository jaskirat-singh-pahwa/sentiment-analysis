Free spirited Eugenie suffers debilitating visions that she cannot control or understand. She is only in need of some gentle guidance, understanding, and self-confidence. Instead, Eugenie is tricked by her parents and committed against her will to a cruel and misogynistic psychiatric ward. Abandoned by her relatives, Eugenie finds a different family among her unlucky ward sisters.Women's history is reimagined in a scorching yet sensitive way by Melanie Laurent who directs and stars in the film. Thankfully the film is made in France, and therefore uncensored and blunt. While the film lacks cohesion and a little spark, it is enlightening and energizing to witness multidimensional, realistic, and complicated female characters, and women behind as well as on the screen who are defined not by men but by themselves.World premiere seen at the Toronto international film festival."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11681282/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Logros parciales en una combinacin de elementos que no alcanza unaPartial achievements in a combination of elements that does not reach a good synthesis ","SummaryMlanie Laurent's film addresses several issues, such as the disciplinary and patriarchal psychiatry of the time and its methods, a supposedly fantastic subplot and the tribulations of its proto-feminist protagonist, with uneven fortune in his development, in the combination of them and in the resulting message. Despite its great staging and its very good performances, it leaves the viewer with a sadness resulting from having witnessed a harsh story about helpless and violated women but that could have been better told, a sadness mix of empathy with them and frustration.Review:Eugnie (Lou de Lage) is a curious young woman with intellectual concerns (a fan of Victor Hugo), with a wealthy and conservative family that takes care to suppress these concerns and prevent her from channeling them. When the father learns that the girl refers to "speaking with spirits", he decides to commit her to the famous Hpital de la Salptrire, a psychiatric institution run by neurologist Jean-Martin Charcot, where he forges a bond with Genevive, the head of nurses (Mlanie Laurent ).Mlanie Laurent's film tackles several issues, with uneven success in its development, in their combination, and in the resulting message. In the first place, it illustrates the cruel "therapeutic" methods of psychiatry at the time, in an institution where in those years (the 80s of the 19th century) Freud himself practiced. It is clear in the film the role of the psychiatric institution and its methods as a device for patriarchal disciplining of "wayward" women (also reduced to the role of guinea pigs), standing as a successor to the witch hunt, now become "hysterical ", According to their definitions. A change from a religious paradigm to a strictly positivist one, both equally totalizing.Secondly, there is the question of Eugnie's connection with the spirits of the dead, does it constitute a delusion of the protagonist or does she indeed possess that gift of hers? This aspect makes some noise and partially weakens the message of the film since at some point it "contaminates" and "justifies" for the gaze of the time the reasons why the protagonist is hospitalized. At the same time, however, the film makes some interesting notes on the relation of rationalistic positivism to the supernatural and religious and on the arrogance of positivism itself in general.Third, the dramatic lift, where the film describes how the protagonist goes from her affluent but unsatisfied family life to the tribulations of mental hospitalization and the ways in which she relates to her companions and her medical staff. She. It is here where Laurent tries to balance rawness with restraint, objectivity with emotion, but the result works by half, since she also fails to provide a too original look. It is in this scenario that the agreements between the patient and the nurse will be woven, where not only the nurse is the one who seeks her salvation. This is where the proto-feminist and sisterhood elements of the story also appear.The Mads Women (the viewer will already see the reason for the title) is a dark and melancholic film, with a great staging where the reconstruction of the period stands out and that has very good performances, but that leaves the viewer with a sadness Resulting from witnessing a harsh story about neglected and abused women that could have been better told, a sadness mixed with empathy with them and frustration."

Was the doctor punished? Did she get better in the end? Also of the entire family the Grandmother understood the main character but she never appears again after a few scenes from the beginning.In addition, I felt more bonding should have been done between the two main characters....it didn't seem real that there was enough of an emotional bond between them to merit the head nurse losing her freedom."

I like the underwater discovery until it gets too chaotic. The filming becomes too confused when they are being chased by the dead. It's impossible to be scared when you don't know what you're seeing. The movie needs to make a flip.

As most reviewers have indicated, the concept is somewhat unique but the overall story is lacking character depth and better explanation.The film quality was not bad but the dialogue didn't add much direction or give the viewer reasons to invest in the characters. There were a few creepy moments but nothing to rave about and there was, in my opinion, a lack luster ending.Simply put, it wasn't awful but it has a long way to go before it can be compared to this directorial duo's brilliance displayed in their prior film "Inside"."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11686490/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," A good effort (and a nice ending) ","The Deep House is an average film most of the time.Only 20 minutes were spent on setting things up, and most of the film's middle part was interesting underwater exploration with a couple of jumpscares.It did, however, lose some tempo closer to the end, since when the things start to get real it is hard to tell what is going on. First-person underwater shots in murky water aren't that informative.Aside from some stupid decisions, most of the reactions were ok, but you can hardly call them motivated since we don't get any character substance. The main guy was motivated by youtube views, the lady just sort of stuck around. They barely share any story or character-related dialogue. The guy is just constantly narrating what is going on. I mean, I guess this works since he's doing a video blog. As for the female lead, I don't know, sometimes she's rightfully scared, sometimes she acts stupid, sometimes she's tough.I had some issues with the story, but most of them are minor, and in this type of film I can look the other way. I guess the rituals gave the family eternal life, and this also works for the house itself, maybe. Pierre brought divers as some fresh meat to the house, but what was his goal exactly? The door was Jesus-sealed, so I guess the previous divers didn't get to it and he assumed that these will? There's also a post-credit scene where he does it again, why? If the ghosts can brick up the windows why not do the same for the ending hole? The house didn't also have the look of a cultists' one, just a normal house with a weird kitchen. There are some tonal differences as well. The first scene feels like a basic found-footage introductory scene. The next one is ripped out of a hipster romantic comedy and finally - an underwater haunted house.Overall, The Deep House is watchable. The premise is very simple and even a little stupid, but it works in this context. An underwater haunted house. Ok.I appreciate the technical side of the film, although nobody can top the underwater scenes of Abyss (1989).It won't blow your mind, but you won't hate it either."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11686490/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","3"," A non-scary wanna-be horror movie, only for diving fans. ","I'm sorry, but having to watch a whole movie through a blurred green veil is not a treat! And that is exactly the case here: the whole movie is set under water, where we follow a couple who dives for fun at buildings that are for some reasons on the bottom of lakes. The outside of the lake where they go for is pictured radiantly blue and bathing in the sun, but once under water it's all dark and misty and very hard to follow. Okay, maybe very authentic, but for one and a half hour this gets rather annoying.Especially annoying, since in this supposed horror movie almost nothing happens, let alone something remotely horrific. There is only one tiny scare, when some drowned persons that they find in the sunken house suddenly open their eyes and turn out to be alive, but after that we just see these drowned zombies (who by the way look as normal and un-scary as anyone alive!), swim endlessly behind the fleeing main characters. Of course they get stuck in the house, of course their oxygen runs out, and the only clich that is avoided here is the proverbial last girl standing, because in the end no-one makes it alive. So if you weren't frustrated already, this will definitely do the trick!There is hardly any acting involved, or it's at least hard to judge, since both actors are packed and hidden in their diving-gear, and their dialogue consist mainly of continuously shouting the name of the other one. Well, that they do convincingly. So my final advice would be: stick to the sunny blue surface and stay away from this totally superfluous Deep House!"

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11686490/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," Should've been scarier from these two guys ","Idk I really like these directors but their last two movies have been underwhelming and under developed.. "The Deep House" follows a couple who investigates creepy locations for their youtube channel. Traditional enough. The girlfriend is almost giving an odd vibe from the start like she's hiding something, or is just really sick of the boyfriends youtube obsession. Even if it's the latter, the way she was standoffish and so talky with the stranger that led them to the deep house made it seem like a secret was going to be revealed at some point. However, as soon as rhe couple dives down underwater the entire surface level plot disappears and is never revisited. There could have been major drama, a war whirling about, forshadowed objects secretly placed for later explanations, and unexplained green eggs and ham on land and it STILL would have all been dropped the second the submerged underwater. The dude that brought them there's last scene was him sitting on a rock at the waters edge. Was he good?...bad?... These directors that I previously adored made these same mistakes is "Kandisha". There were unexplained things and dropped subplots through out that film too.I just say the music was really good in the first third especially then opening credits song. The opening credits were done really well. I was so interested in the first 30 minutes of the film. I couldn't wait to see how these directors deal with the underwater elements especially because I knew of this movie for a long timenbefore it's release. When they got down to the deep house there was a sense of uneasiness with a veterans touch. This is that feeling we got more from horror movies from 2012-2016. Since then people have been trying to be SO different and SO unique that this traditional unnervingness is lost within. It is ever present here, though. There was truly creepy nuances and clues in the deep house. The dead people chained below is a cool concept and pretty scary. This all worked imo until they return to the dead people and they are gone. This is where it became a more basic and traditional horror film for me. I call it horror because yes it is a horror movie in the sensenof the genre but there are no kills here untilnthe only two characters in the very end. The previous films by these directors have been chock full of violence and bloodshed, their first film even being an extreme horror movie that is unwatchable to most. They toned it down big time.The thrill of the underwater becomes mundane as the movie enters boring territory and between its shaky jumbled camera work while being chased and its lack of development in the second half of the film, it ends with a small puff of dust. Average film."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11686490/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," The premise is genuinely unique, but it doesn't do enough good things with it. ","Okay, so I have to preface this by saying that I watched this based on the pedigree of the writer/directors without so much as glancing at the trailer. By the writers/directors of Inside, one of the greatest horror movies ever made?!? I couldn't download this movie fast enough!So the premise is that there is a Youtuber couple who want to take their channel to the next level by scuba diving to an intact house at the bottom of a lake. Okay, I've seen hundreds of horror movies in my time, but I have never seen or heard of one where the setting is submerged house, meters below the surface of the water. It was nice to be given something unique for a change, and it started off really promising....and then it fizzles into a wholehearted MEH of a movie that could have been so much more if they just pushed it further. First of all, the physics inside the house were all over the place. I mean, I get that they needed to allow the couple to freely traverse the place without constantly bumping into chairs and phones and stuff, but come on! We had certain objects just laying there, as if they weren't submerged at all, just sitting on desks like they were above water. The next scene, there'd be pianos and chairs floating all over the place. At least be consistent with your setting!Then it's the actual "horror" in this horror film. Jump scares annoy the living hell out of me, and this movie was just one jump scare after another. I mean, are these the same guys that made a movie about a nurse cutting a baby out a woman's stomach? What happened? When did they start making juvenile, tween horror films that rely on jump scares instead of being truly disturbing? I was hoping for a twisted plot about the ghosts of a deranged family trapped in a house after it became part of a dam. What I got was a lame story about child sacrifice, revenge of the town's people and not even a full exposition, just some half-hearted explanation that made me roll my eyes in a "we've seen this a hundred times" type of fashion.Man, I really wanted to like this movie, and it really did have everything going for it; the acting was good, the setup was strong, and the actual action was mostly clean and easy to see. But then the "ghosts" all looked like they were holding their breaths and it just ruined everything from that moment on.Waste potential from two dudes who could have done so much more, but I guess profit beats artistic integrity these days, doesn't it? What a shame.At least the ending was realistic and wasn't ruined by American horror movie standards."

","I was really looking forward to this.So much disappointment.Some of the most emotionless, non-human, illogical, acting and dialogue I've seen in quite a while. Topped off with absolutely no horror, no tension...and no jump scares.Boring, slow, unrealistic, annoying!"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11686490/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Creepy ","I guess this is more scary to people with a fear of dark water, or lakes. That combined with a haunted house... eek. Also not being able to get away fast enough in the water."

Some of the shots later in the film are so startling, it makes me wonder if filming was intentionally restrained during the first act to increase later impact. Probably not! But kinda felt that way.The story is super frustrating, predictable and disappointing. No meaningful rules are established, the horror is neither described nor satisfying in its mystery, and the ending? An attempt to get cute at the end just feels dumb. This movie could been saved by a good third act, and really (because of the loose nature of story telling) the third act could gone in many interesting directions.Feels a lot like I'm describing a 4/10 movie at best, but I'm not exaggerating - the underwater production and shots are just incredible. Some very haunting imagery is there to be had. The moment to moment interaction, pacing, throughout the film is also sound. That includes dialog, acting - location... Deep House does stuff right.I rarely go over a 5 for movies I feel struggle with story, but I had some fun with this one. 6 out of 10."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11686490/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," So claustrophobic you'll feel like you're drowning while watching it ","THE DEEP HOUSE is an extremely unique horror movie with good acting, creepy visuals, and an atmosphere that smothers you beyond the end credits. The majority of the movie takes place underwater and is so claustrophobic that you'll feel like you're being drowned while viewing it. I haven't felt this suffocated since the first time I watched THE DESCENT - seriously. I thoroughly enjoyed this one and highly recommend it."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11686490/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","2"," Brilliant start and the... writers ran out of ideas. ","It is a huge swing and a miss. The whole concept from the start was just amazing as you wonder what is going on, what is with this house under the water, and what is the mystery.But then it just turned into a cliche pie of a generic overdone horror flick... well, except it is underwater.I wish I didn't waste my time on this."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11686490/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","1"," Ben Ben Ben ","Oh my lord. 75% of this movie is the woman screaming Ben Ben Ben Ben. Over and over and over. To the director of this movie, you made your point, she was looking for Ben. Was it really necessary for her to scream it 100 times during the movie. That alone brought the rating down a few but the ending and the whole movie being in the dark where you only see 25% of the screen and the rest is black and several other reasons. My recommendation skip this piece of garbage. You'll be more satisfied sorting your sock drawer then watching this movie."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11692070/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," Good for kids ","After losing her parents, fourteen-year-old Annabel has moved in with her grandfather a fisherman, on a Caribbean Island where her best friend is a dolphin named Mitzy. However, her maternal grandparents don't see this as a suitable life for a young girl and come to take her away.We don't often watch family films here, but this is a cute story about finding the family that you want, not the one you are necessarily born into. Peter Woodward (who was in The Patriot) is really good in this as the grandfather. It's a nice film for young audiences who are animal lovers and may not have seen many coming of age movies.Mike Disa, who directed this, comes from the animation world, having directed films like Dante's Inferno and Dead Space - based on the video games - and kids movies like Space Dogs: Adventure to the Moon, Postman Pat: The Movie and Hoodwinked Too! There's a horror connection as well, as writer Shaked Berenson produced Turbokid, JeruZalem, Slaxx, Tales of Halloween and The Man Who Killed Hitler and Then the Bigfoot."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11692070/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Beatiful locations for a touching story about how love is a bond that can't be broken ","Dolphin Island is an interesting movie because of the dynamic between the two characters, Jonah (Peter Woodward) and Annabelle (Tyer Jade Nixon). I enjoy the relationship between the characters and the humanity added to the dolphin is a unique touch. It is interesting to watch Jonah and Annabelle interact with the dolphin. I really love seeing the dolphin perform human tasks and seemingly communicating with Annabelle. This shows how the director, Mike Disa, humanizes the dolphin. Dolphin Island makes me believe the characters enjoy spending time with each other and they truly love one another. The only problem I have with the movie is the title. Calling it Dolphin Island makes me think there's a bunch of dolphins in the movie and they are the focus of the movie. However, the movie is good enough for me to quickly get over that disappointment.The story is about a 14-year-old girl, Annabelle, whose parents die and who lives in the Bahamas with Jonah, her grandfather. Her best friend is a dolphin named Mitzy. Life is good until Annabelle's maternal grandparents (David Raizor and Annette Lovrien Duncan) show up with a lawyer and demand that Annabelle come to New York to live with them.At times Dolphin Island can be sad and emotional, especially when it comes to Annabelle and her great loss. The actors portray the emotion you would expect from a family that loses a loved one. Annabelle's character says and does some things that I see myself doing in the same situation, such as treating Mitzy like a person. When Mitzy sprays Jonah, Annabelle says it is because Mitzy is a good judge of humor. Also, Peter Woodward (as Jonah) really seems to have a good relationship with Annabelle. For example, when Jonah says he wants to show Annabelle what it is like to be happy, I really believe his character wants this. Dolphin Island shows us the relationship between some of the people on the island with Annabelle, Mitzy and Jonah. Seeing those relationships makes us see why Annabelle is so happy on the island and how this helps her cope with her parents' death. The story offers a brilliant take on what makes a family a true family - sometimes family is by blood, sometimes by friendships, and sometimes with animals. Dolphin Island presents some unpredictable plot twists you don't expect along with strong character development.The message of this movie is that family will always be there for you and that love conquers all, even when things are at their worst. Along with that strong message, just like the title suggests, Dolphin Island teaches viewers a little about dolphins and how lovable and smart they really are.I give Dolphin Island 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 5 to 18. Grownups will enjoy it as well. Reviewed by Ayden P., KIDS FIRST!"

","Dolphin Island is an emotional, inspiring, feel-good movie! It demonstrates the significance of communal friendships and familial bonds. I enjoyed the themes of good vs evil and the power of love, and how it offers a true bonding experience.This is such a positive and satisfying film. I quickly connected to Jonah Coleridge and his teen granddaughter, Annabel. Their relationship is exceptionally sweet, and though their Dolphin Island houseboat is an unconventional home, it is filled with tenderness, acceptance, and love. The island neighbors are fun and diverse, and Annabel's best friend, a lovable dolphin named Mitzi, might be the dearest Island member of all.There are so many great characters/actors in this movie. My favorites are:Jonah Coleridge, played by Peter Woodward (THE PATRIOT) Annabel Coleridge, played by Tyler Jade Nixon (DOLPHIN KICK) Mateo, Annabel's sly, lovable friend, played by Aaron Burrows Mr. Carbunkle, the easy-to-dislike lawyer played by Bob Bledsoe (PARKS AND RECREATION)I enjoyed every aspect of this tale. It made me giggle, cry, grimace, and sigh, but ultimately left me beaming. Dolphin Island a clean, meaningful, and soul-stirring film suitable for the entire family.Disclosure: Many thanks to Entertainment Squad for providing this product/product information for review.

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11692070/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," KInda like the 1960's Flipper TV Series ","Without giving away too much of the story, I can tell you it has the same overtones as the 1960's TV series, FLIPPER, but updated to modern times. If you are old enough to remember this fun, family- oriented TV series, you know it involved an extraordinarily intelligent dolphin that was "best friends" with two main teenage characters, Sandy and Bud, and he often helped rescue one (or both) from a dangerous situation surrounding the sea. The TV series was entertaining and full of family values. It is the same with DOLPHIN ISLAND. While it may not be the best film I have ever seen, it was good, and I would recommend it for families and/or youth groups.

I cringed every time they try to spoonfeed words and sometimes those words doesn't match action and emotion of characters. They could have shown the island more and do some character development."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11692070/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Cute and Clean family film! ","One of the things I miss from my time in Christian Retail was helping to review nearly every film that we sold for content. In the Christian film industry, there are times where you get GREAT films, and other times you get films that are well meaning, but due to poor writing, acting, etc., they miss the mark.The kids and I recently given the link to watch this film, Dolphin Island, and to review. The concept of the movie is simple. A Young girl has experienced the loss of both parents and is living with her Grandfather in a houseboat in a fishing community. The rich Grandparents who have had nothing to do with her for 10 years now want to take full custody and will use any means necessary to do so.First let me say, it is a well-suited film for young children, although the topic can be a bit intense and there is a scene where the girl runs away, and a boat explodes leaving her unconscious in the water. Depending on your child that might be a bit intense. If you are looking for a family movie night without language, violence, and you've caught up on all other films. Then this is the film for you.The scenery is beautiful, and the use of live animals is a plus in this film. Especially on a snowy northeast Ohio day, it will make you ready for a vacation to Sunny Coasts.Some of the acting makes this a movie that my teenage self would have made fun of my parents for watching. Yet it is very enjoyable and fun to watch. Disclosure: Many thanks to Entertainment Squad for providing this product/product information for review.

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11692070/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," Hope at home ","After a lot of time at home, we were thankful for a family-friendly movie I got to screen from the comfort of our couch. My husband, mother-in-law, and I may have liked it more than the kids, but we also were glad for some clean entertainment to share with the youngsters in the house."Dolphin Island" is a heartwarming feature film about 14-year-old Annabel who lives with her fisherman grandfather on an island paradise. They operate a nonprofit marine research and conservation center. She is surrounded by an extended family of loving but quirky neighbors and her best friend, a dolphin named Mitzy. Everything changes when her maternal grandparents arrive with a shifty lawyer to bring her back to New York. Annabel and her friends navigate these circumstances to prove that love conquers all.My kids all reacted like anyone who knows them would expect: Rachel, who is 5, talked about how much she likes dolphins and asked about going to the beach. The 11-year-old Ben liked the action that came with the pirate-like barrister, which of course we had to define as an attorney for him. Cate, the resident teenager, wasn't so sure about an inspirational film, but she periodically made comments about the main character."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11692070/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Recommended for the whole family ","Dolphin Island is a fun, family-friendly film. The photography was quite good and the location was lovely.Anna's story was touching - orphaned at five years old. And her loving grandfather, Jonah, gave up his career as a history professor at Cambridge to take over her care and run the marine institute her parents had founded. Jonah was quite realistic in that he got angry when provoked and made a couple of poor choices that added conflict to the story. The friendship between Anna and Mitzy, the dolphin, was sweet! I liked watching them swim and play together.I really appreciated that there was no foul language and that even though they were in a tropical location, there wasn't an overabundance of skin on display. Ana wore a one-piece swimsuit when she was in the water and dressed tastefully and modestly when on land.While lighthearted for the most part, a conflict brought a somber element that helped balance the rest.My husband and I both felt that the acting was, at times, a little over the top. Especially at the beginning. Some situations were simply implausible - and not just because the film targeted a younger audience.Overall, I recommend this for anyone looking for a wholesome film for the whole family to enjoy.Many thanks to Collide Distribution for providing this product/product information for review.

True it is temporary but still it is better than nothing.

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11694776/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","2"," Boring ","Although the premise may seem interesting, it gets slow and boring very quickly, the whole first hour of the movie tells you absolutely nothing, the script is disgusting, too many unnecessary scenes, it does not have a good plot, the plot is poor thing, what happens does not make much sense, the performances are not bad but not very good, the dialogues are terrible, I could not empathize with the main character since he makes the most stupid decisions, the only remarkable thing is the photography that emphasizes the nature that surrounds the characters and the production design is good too. The script makes it unbearable to endure more than an hour and a half watching the movie, definitely a waste of time."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11698630/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," Crazy in love ","Different than Beyonce meant for sure. But still crazy as can be. Now seeing the main female character, it is not really tough to make her - to decipher her ... issues? That's one way to describe her - but it also makes her fun and exciting. Of course the question is, with all the highs, there are obviously also a lot of lows along the way.What really makes this movie though is not the crazy couple itself. Or not just to be fair - because one of the most emotional moments (or a couple of them to be truthful) comes from a side character and his daughter. Even without having children of my own - this really strikes home! I do believe that viewers will be touched by that scene .. really putting the heart into all the craziness going on.A movie that is as heartfelt as it is funny ..."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11698630/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Good Combination of Romcom and Mental Illness ","A new Spanish romcom on Netflix. A journalist, Adri, spent a crazy night with Carla, a random girl he met at the bar. Falling in love, he tried to get into the psychiatric home to meet her.What I loved about the movie was the interaction between Adri and the people he spent in the psychiatric home. The scenes were really sweet, especially the one where he tried to hook up a girl with Tourette's with her crush. This was also where most of the comedy was used. Most of them landed and either made me chuckled or straight up laughing.Not only the movie was funny, it also had some unexpectedly emotional scenes, especially the one with Adri's roommate in the home. The roommate was an old man with paranoia, and his story was quite sad, but at the end it was heartwarming.For the romance, the two actors for Adri and Carla had good chemistry, although I wanted a bit more scenes with them together to strengthen the relationship further. Because of this, I wasn't too convinced about how their scene at the end.The unique element of the movie was combining romcom with mental illness. I felt that the movie did a decent job bringing awareness to certain conditions as well as mental illness as a whole.The problem with the movie, in addition to the romance, was that it's still a cheesy romcom throughout, and there wasn't any surprises. However, this might not be a problem to many, like me.Overall, a funny and quite emotional romance with a unique premise. 8/10"

Intelligence without being arrogant.He talks about the importance of mental illnesses, what society labels as normal, taking risks, valuing the people who are close to us and those with different capacities.As the Spanish film Campeones addresses disability, it tries to follow in its footsteps without succeeding.It has a very interesting point that you can't see at first glance because it starts out like a generic movie.Catch you Organic comedy moments and other emotional ones that touch your heart."

I think it's a very sensitive topic and it deserves the respect it's shown by the portrayal of each character, both on how they're written and performed. I honestly think everyone should watch films like this one, maybe they'd be more sensitive to people who deal with these issues IRL. Brilliant."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11698630/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Generic rom-com with a purpose ","This movie is by large a generic rom-com that definitely lacks finesse. However, it has good acting performances and a sincere message. However, it is a bit too long, has a few plot holes, especially how Adri can stay hospitalized for so long without any illness. The article at the end of the film was also unnecessary as there has been no focus on this at all.A surprisingly excellent film."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11698630/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," yet another 'disable'-ation movie ","Romantic story? The movie is trying to normalize the disabled. They are people too, they think, they understand their condition, they live relatively happily in rehab clinic. Yes, no, pain of 'One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest." Moreover, the bipolar's excited state might so great that a 'normal' person can so deeply and 'happily every after'-ly fall in love.The movie ends nicely, as in we will be together every after, when the mentally sick person gets better --- what is this? The authors simply did not know how to end it, giving a false positive spin to a hopeless situation.I feel that this false expectation that the movie sets for the disabled, for the seriousness of their disability, for the seriousness of the impact their condition has on their close ones and society is a whole is insensitive and even offensive.It's beautiful movie, but that's exactly what makes it offensive, cause the reality is far from pretty."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11698630/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," Better than I thought ","The beginning was funny but a typical lightweight Netflix movie. Gradually it got better, especially when the viewer realises that Carla is manic-depressive. The film is too : the opening scene is over-the-top manic, later is becomes depressive. Gradually a balance is found, accepting the reality, just as Adri accepts Carla as who she really is.Some very funny lines. My favourite at the end : Adri "I thought you never wanted to see me again?" Carla: "I'm bipolar, I tend to change my mind"."

This movie is very genuine and the acting done by all actors is just amazing specially the lead female actress and lead male actor.

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11698630/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," Beautiful but definitely you either get it or you don't. ","Beautiful way to shape the story and give insight to what it is like to suffer with mental health issues from all different types of perspectives ranging from BPD to OCD and how it effects each life in ways of openness to love and family situations. We see a lot of character growth in Adri from not understanding quite well of the people in his surroundings to making connections with each of them and understanding their human emotions and what they struggle with. My two favorite scenes was the Father who escaped because of the broken feelings he felt from being away from his daughter and how Adri got to learn how each state of mind ranges and can't be dealt with how you would normally. My most favorite scene was when Carla was trying to push away Adri at the end exploiting her worst traits trying to see if he would leave. Personally it is very hard to be open if you have struggled with something that pushes people away but to watch Adri promise love her through good and bad even when he knows it is going to be hard made my little girl heart flutter. To be let down so many times to have someone stay even if you aren't sure they will in the long run but to just have hope and to hear someone will stay even when they know it won't be easy and they won't try to change you. I really love how this movie was directed. I give it a 9/10 only because if there was a sequel I truly wonder if they will stay together because in reality BPD really puts strain and struggle into a relationship and no matter how close two people are they will never truly understand and feel what goes through the mind of the person struggling with BPD nor will the person with BPD feel completely understood. But truly this is an amazing movie, and you either get it or you don't based on your mindset and how open you are to understand."

I also believe that casual fans will enjoy it as well because the writing is good and the emotions generated by the performances goes from tearful to laughter.The music is wonderful as the producers were able to obtain the rights to the original music composed by Earle Hagen which adds even more to the feeling of Mayberry.This film is not a remake but draws from the family feel that made Mayberry a place that many have loved for decades."

And they must have done all this in during the pandemic of course.The Tribute artist are awesome. Especially Floyd and Barney. Man, they each have the voice and the mannerisms of the charters they mimic.Chris - Needed what the judge sentenced him to. More judges should do something similar to this in the future. I can think of another actor or two in Hollywood who just might benefit from a week at Mayberry Days.Good job to the director, actors and crews. If you every paid attention to Floyd the Barber - Two Chairs No Waiting - you know that Allan Newsome has him down to a T. Very funny expressions. Zoom in!!Now this is a movie fans can enjoy forever. It is timeless, and the message is timeless.Moving it up near Waking Ned Devine as one of my favorite movies. Oh, you haven't seen Waking Ned Devine? Well you are in for another treat. Especially if you ever dreamed of winning the lottery.Cheers all,now, where is that popcorn. Let's watch this moving again."

Firstly coming to story, its fresh to south indian film and treatment was completely new. It(treatment) has seemed more of a korean film. What seemed more impressive is the way it is presented without making changes to make it viable to south indian audience. It was presented genuinely and it was smooth throughout. I have seen Ashok Selvans Oh My Kaduvale and Thegidi and now after watching this, it seems like he is excellent with his script selections, That seems to be his USP. I hope he continues to select such refreshing and unique scripts. And coming to performances, all the predominant actors ashok selvan, ritu varma and nitya menon were awesome and apt to their characters. Nitya Menon was very good with her innocence. She was adorable. Her chemistry with ashok selvan was cute on screen. Cinematography and lighting were very pleasant and eye catching on screen. Direction, screenplay and editing were in line with the mood of the movie. Nasser ans satya(comedian) characters was pretty good. Songs were addictive and 'Naa Kosam' Song doesnt seem to leave me in near future, rest of the songs as well worked well for the film. On a Whole it is a cute and a pleasant movie. You will get this line after watching the film but "I would Love to have such Muscle Spasms in future if I find a purest soul like Maaya"."

It doesn't even shy away from its inspirations by showing 'Ratatouille' in the beginning yet there is no scene that copies it. Even after being an old wine, this new bottle does make it better by adding depth and emotions to its characters. It does give an explanation for the characters' lifestyle, be it the master chef, the humble follower with OCD or the talented newbie. The film starts, goes on and ends in a perfectly simple and elegant manner with impressive shots and sweet music. With no unnecessary jokes or a misplaced scene/ dialogue this is definitely a well made film that fills the heart.Ashok Selvan, Nassar, Nitya Menon, and Ritu Varma were just fantastic. A good addition to food film genre after 'Ratatouille' and 'Chef'.Ani I. V. Sasi s/o the legendary malayalam film maker I. V. Sasi proves his potential.

","I love Rom-com's and I don't think there would be anyone who would hate this genre, Rom-coms are light, funny, a slice of life subject's which many of the audience can relate to. Though making one, you've got to have the ingredients right, and in Ninnila Ninnila, the list is perfect. It is after a long time that in Indian Cinema, there's a movie with so much aesthetic appeal. The colour palette and the soft key lighting cinematography are absolutely outstanding. From the beautiful frames of London city to the dishes being prepared in the kitchen, the cinematography impresses the most. Ashok Selvan is an impeccable actor, he proves it again, he pulls off the role of 'Dev' with so much ease. Ritu Varma and Nithya Menen are refreshingly honest and wholesomely charming. Nassar as the Head Chef of the restaurant impresses with his subtle yet candid performance. To establish all the characters of the story, the movie takes time, but it does not bore you out because the Director has packed this dish with a lot of beautiful elements, and at some places, there are resemblances with the famous animated movie 'Ratatouille'. You are definitely in for a treat if rom-com's are your appetite."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11725680/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," An Entertainment film from first to last ","Akhil garu performance is very good, Pooja is beautiful and delivers a good performance as usual, from first to last scene the movie is so entertaining."

Movie is like bit and pieces they is no interlink no stories ,very bad comedy ,No proper song for dance, First half Akhil looks thin and second half he becomes bulk and muscular...in between he goes for America and just comes back after song...lot of characters in movie come and go which don't have purpose..vennela kishore, rajesh , Ajay all characters have bad comedy..The movie is mess... doesn't have proper story line or message in the end.I would not recommend this movie."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11725680/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," Orange 2 from badhkar sir ","After orange (2011) a true love is not got for bhaskar sir from Ram charan so he took grudge on audience such that a true love before marriage is done by MOST ELIGIBLE BACHELOR (2021) by Akhil now audience took grudge by (you know what I mean reader) on him. So, on coming days Bhaskar sir is ready with script to take grudge on audience by finding true love after marriage I think. Hope we love your searching of true love sirP. S: eagarly waiting for Orange 3 to release thank you sir for boring us."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11725680/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","3"," Boring movie ","I watched it seeing stupid reactions of fans in youtube, movie is too boring and don't understand how can they make a movie out of a such thin story line. Screenplay, comedy everything is too boring."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11725680/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," I literally slept in the theatre ","I always wanted to watch this film. I had certain expectations which was not satisfied. First half of the movie was so lengthy and boring...second half seemed to be interesting at the starting but again felt bored again later. Hero who has been working in US, didn't have his own opinion on marriage. The whole story revolves around making him realise what marriage is all about. Lot of worthless comedies which made movie still more boring...one thing I liked in this movie was pooja hegde's acting. She deserved better! Akhil's acting is also good.One time watch movie!"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11725680/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","2"," Boring Movie... ","No need to say much about this movie. Because as it doesnot contain good theme. Completely waste attempt by the director. As hero's comeback movie became disaster. We movie lovers wont recommend any director to do this sort of boring movies and dont put on us .Nothing more ,no fun.If any got hurt, dont feel .I took out money from my pocket watch this movie. Not you. So 2 was my rating."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11725680/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","3"," Too much Judgmental and Boring Movie script ","As director well known for abnormal script writing and too much opinion around Love / Romantic life. This movie has no Vibes of creativity or original thoughts. Except few tit bits of humour and melody songs rest movie fall steeply low."

Nice performances from the lead pair Akhil,pooja..

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11725680/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," In-depth marriage philosophy with modern touch ","I won't reveal any story plot because you individually should enjoy it.....The framing of characters is good . Pooja hegde's ideology of An independent women is soothening to see and and Realisation of Minute nuances regarding life is too good. Comedy is good and second could have been slightly better . Background music and songs are somewhat disappointing. And if you want to spend your time in a fruitful way this movie is the best choice.....you will have no regrets for your ticket cost after watching the movie."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11725680/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","2"," What is the matter with Tollywood movies these days? ","I woke up today with a hope that this movie would be a fun way to spend a Saturday afternoon. I have never been so wrong. My disappointment is immeasurable and my day has been thoroughly ruined.Harsha the movie protagonist who works abroad has seemingly taken a leave of absence for 20 days. His plan? To get married back in India with all the arrangements done but without a bride selected yet, all in the span of 20 days. So his journey begins for the search of a suitable bride. The rest of the first half is full of cringey jokes and shows how he messes up and ends up having to leave the country.A determined Harsha returns back to India and proceeds to stalk the heroine until she ultimately falls in love with him. This has to be the most clich thing in a movie. Perhaps the Telugu movie industry has to rethink what they portray to the young population of our society. There is no way a girl would fall for a creepy stalker who would shadow her every move. This can literally only happen in movies like this.The climax of the movie was another let down. Harsha's whole family who were earlier disappointed with his actions were determined to marry him off. Until of course he magically convinced everyone with his monologue like every other Tollywood hero does. Overall the movie was boring and not up to the mark."
