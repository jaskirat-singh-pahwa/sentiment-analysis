The thriller of a man-eating tigress, who is thrown into a deserted guest house, is easy to show in one hour and 26 minutes, but a two-hour film also has to resort to another story. Here too, there is a story of a serial killer who grabbed the property of rich widow women by trapping them, but every scene of the story is familiar, so it does not give the feeling of thriller. For anyone who has watched Burning Bright, the film is useless."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11640536/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","2"," Snoozefest ","Hagen is a decent actor, but what does Hamer want to convey with this movie? So many things didn't make sense to me. Like, why is the story set in a Rust Belt town, in the middle of nowhere in the US, when it's not even shot in the US, but Canada, and the plot is loosely based on a Norwegian book called "Sluk?" There are plenty of depressing rusty old industrial towns in Scandinavia Hamer could use as a more efficient backdrop to this story. This backdrop would even better match the acting style of the Scandinavian actors, Nordic noir. All of them looked out of sorts in this Rust Belt town. I was not convinced the Scandinavian actors were American and/or had any real connection to the town, even though Hamer threw in a few family members and friends for the connection to seem real. Their accents were also all over the place, even though they tried to pull off an Appalachian dialect. Hamer could have closed this gap if he'd chosen a location closer to home. Nope. The movie fell flat for me and in the end I didn't care what happened to any of the characters. Sad. I really wanted to love this movie."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11641654/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," Not very good ","The first movie in the series is better, but that isn't saying much. The high scoring, favorable reviews for this are fake. This is basically the same movie as the first one but watered down a bit. The first was more convincing in portraying the forbidden love between professor and student. This movie plays on the same theme but skips more of the drama and gets more into the sexual tension and romance. It's an embellished female fantasy of having a handsome, wealthy suitor who lavishes attention and fine dining, etc. without having sexual demands in return. There is a LOT of suck face going on, and it gets tiresome after a while. The movie does capture some of the same mood as the first one, so if you particularly liked the first one you might like this. But it mostly just plays like a bad harlequin romance novel."

For those who still have even the slightest romantic side left, this might just make you melt in your chair while laughing at how silly you are for doing it. Bravo! Bring on the next one."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11641654/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," Much better than Gabriel's Inferno part 1! ","Firstly this review is for part 2 of the first movie 'Gabriel's Inferno', which was cut into 3 parts, this IMDb page is for 'Gabriel's Rapture' which is the second movie and is NOT released yet! So Rapture and Part 2 of 'Gabriel's Inferno' are NOT the same movie! Just wanted to clarify this. Now to my review, while I loved part 1 of Gabriel's Inferno, it is inferior compared to part 2, the acting improves in part 2, the relationship between Gabriel & Julia also intensifies & becomes a lot more passionate & romantic in part 2, part 2 is when we see them finding each other again after being separated for 6 years & falling in love with each other again. And the chemistry between the lead actors Giulio and Melanie is incredible, every scene with them is believable, I can really feel the deep love their characters have for each other and that's due to the wonderful chemistry between the actors! As for those comparing this to 50 shades of grey, they clearly don't know the difference between love and lust, I think many people's idea of "romance" nowadays is just raunchy sex, but love & romance is so much more than just sex, movies like 50 shades & 365 days glorify sex & are full of raunchy meaningless sex & forcing women into abusive relationships, that's not "love", it's just lust & abuse. The Gabriel's Inferno series has always been different, it's about REAL love, focusing more on the emotional connection & love between 2 people, it takes it's time to develop the characters & the relationships hence it's slower-paced, but this means Gabriel's Inferno focuses on creating deep & meaningful relationships and real passion based on true love, not meaningless raunchy sex. Unlike 50 shades & 365 days, the Gabriel's Inferno series is a classic romance story about courtly love. I look forward to part 3 of Gabriel's Inferno, the second movie Gabriel's Rapture and the 3rd movie Gabriel's Redemption!"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11641654/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," Incredible storytelling! ","Well done, Passionflix. What an incredible film. Part Two hit every pivotal scene a fan yearns to see. Thank you, Tosca Musk for staying true to the authors beautiful body of work. I've never watched a film that is so close to a book than Gabriel's Inferno. Every scene was perfect thanks the talents of Giulio and Melanie."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11641654/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," Fantastic book-to-screen adaptation of Gabriel's Inferno Part II! ","I am reviewing Part II of "Gabriel's Inferno," not "Gabriel's Rapture". The first movie was split into three parts. Now that's out of the way... In Part II, Gabriel and Julia are trying to define their evolving relationship. The power dynamic shifts from Part I, and this film is packed with romantic scenes as they share secrets and explore a possible future together. This results in many romantic encounters, both playful and passionate. But both still hold many painful secrets that have shaped who they are now. These themes continue to run parallel with the poetry of Dante, and other literal and artist works of medieval Italy. Tosca Musk and the team at Passionflix are making movies in a whole new way, one that respects the original work (book) as well as the readers who love these works. Unconstrained by movie theater schedules, distribution company guidelines, need for certain "names," etc., this team gives these books the time and attention they need to bring them to life. Director Tosca estimated that the full run time for Gabriel's Inferno runs at about six hours... which is why this film is in three parts. And I wouldn't want it any other way. Minimal edits... it reads almost line-for-line with the novel. The cast selected for this film was superb!! While the character of Gabriel Emerson is American, the actor, Giulio Berruti, is Italian. But his accent doesn't bother me, given that these characters are specialists in Italian literature and speak some Italian throughout the movie. Giulio not only resembles the character Gabriel as written, his acting is spot on. He can be an absolute "ass," or a tender lover. Melanie Zanetti, in the role of Julia Mitchell, is young, petite, and lovely just as described in the novel. Her chemistry with Giulio is off the charts... from a smolder to a sizzle. While this film does not have a major studio budget, the production has a cinematic feel and the attention to detail on the sets is exquisite. The author, Sylvain Reynard, incorporates a soundtrack of sorts in his books, and the production team has either incorporated his suggestions or added additional music to create a wonderful aural backdrop for this production. I had not read the books before watching Part I, so I didn't know what to expect. Part I of this series is a slow burn, then Part II really builds on the relationship between the leads. I cannot wait for Part III, as the drama is really going to ramp up. This film is emotional, angsty, romantic, and funny in moments - I truly enjoyed it. I've watched Part II three times now - Tosca gives the love scenes the time they need to really build on the passion and depth, while still being tasteful. These films, in my opinion, are the finest book-to-screen adaptations that I have ever watched, and I am so happy I am able to experience them. I'm looking forward to more movies from this author's books, and from the Passionflix team."

What else can we say that this film is a real nugget of Perfection! It's flawless from start to finish!Tosca Musk and the actors do total justice to the work of Sylvain Reynard. The first part was already excellent but the second is sublime. Some scenes are as I imagined them while reading the book and give me exactly the same emotions.Giulio Berruti and Melanie Zanetti completely master their character and teach us a little more about their character. Showing us the incredible diversity of their range of actors. Mary Pocrnic's script is as faithful to the book and to SR as ever by placing our favorite quotes in right places.A more present soundtrack is a real plus. And for good reason, some were created especially for the film. Roll on the release of the Origin Soundtrack this Fall!I repeat my first impressions since the first film: There is no better film adaptation of a romance book than Gabriel's Inferno Movie!Well done everyone for your incredible work and a huge thank you for continuing to make us dream through your films. It's a safe bet that Gabriels Inferno Movie pt3 will be grandiose.We can never be grateful enough to Sylvain Reynard for this magnificent saga and all of his work which brings us so much happiness."

Just wow!Yeah, take heed and pay attention to the reviews here for "Escape From Area 51". Why? Well, because this 2021 sci-fi comedy is exactly as bad as the other reviewers make it out to be. And not bad in the way where it becomes hilarious to watch or enjoy, nay, "Escape From Area 51" was just downright horrible.The storyline told in "Escape From Area 51", as written by Ted Chalmers, Eric Mittleman and Carlos Perez was just not delivering anything worthwhile, and it was a massive struggle to sit through this poorly written movie, which felt more like a college film class project than an actual movie.Not only was the storyline a swing and a miss, but the characters in the movie were every bit as off target as the storyline was. So that combination didn't really make for an entertaining movie experience. The dialogue written for the characters matched the characters in pointlessness and stupidity, so that counts for something, I guess. The acting performances were dubious.Then there was the special effects and CGI effects. Boy, that was indeed something else. And not in a good way. The CGI in "Escape From Area 51" was just something you'd see in an early 1990s PC game. I kid you not, it was that lame and bad. It amazes me how something that laughable makes it to the screen in 2021.I managed to suffer through about half of this ordeal of a movie, then I was good and ready to give up on everything. So I left the movie, and I will never return to watch the rest of it, because I was by no means entertained by what transpired on the screen.Director Eric Mittleman took a swing here, but everything fell short of delivering anything worthwhile.My rating of "Escape From Area 51" lands on a one out of ten stars. Don't waste your time, money or effort on this movie. So of us did, in lesser or greater extend, so you don't have to."

","I'd have given this 2 stars as if very drunk or 14 years old, you might enjoy it in a "so bad it's good" way but I knocked a star off for being so sexist. No, not the scanty costumes, the way every male character in this show is either evil, stupid, or both. And every female character is super-competent and good. Oh, and lines about "on every planet, it is the women who step forward to sacrifice themselves". Must be news to all the dead allied soldiers littering the battlefields of WWII.Anyway, gross misandry aside, I would love, love, love to know how this film got made. I mean, the guy playing the main baddy is actually someone I recognize from mainstream films. He's a decent actor. So what's going on here? Did he do it as a favour to a niece or something? Sexual favours? I reckon the budget for this thing is around $2000 (feeding twenty people for the two days they must have spent filming this adds up). I particularly like how every time the main villain stops to communicate with his ship on his wanderings, it's the SAME tree stump he is sitting on.No really, anyone who knows how this got made please reply - did someone promise their daughter they could be in a movie? Was it someone's highschool project? Or just the director's way of meeting some attractive women and getting them to walk around in tight outfits?Still, it will probably make a profit if even one person buys the DVD."

Con looses his wife, Annabel, and daughter to a hit and run careless driver, Anton, who also happens to be a drug dealer. Con gets a good look at all 5 people in the car, who speed off-probably on their way to make a drug deal. Con gets depressed and thinks of committing suicide until he gets the idea to go after them and take his own vengeance-instead of calling the police, like most people would do. Since his family died, Con has been working & living at a church where he meets Sarah, a woman that also lost her spouse. Although Con is no professional killer, he seems to hold his own against the bad guys, knocking them off one by one and getting the girl at the end.It didn't have a rating but it contained violence and language and had a running time of 1 hour & 19 minutes.It's not one that I would buy on DVD or even rent. I guess it would be alright to watch it when it comes to cable."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11650226/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Brooding, brutal & well crafted. ","Vengeance is Mine is a quiet, brooding action drama of revenge and murder. Harry (Con O'Neill), sets himself up as an amateur assassin of the gang that killed his family, but his own ineptitude isn't his only downfall.If you warmed a cinema seat in that, you'll need to add this to your viewing list. It is a violent and bloody film with a twist of the surreal. Harry is neither a villain nor a gung-ho killer that we are supposed to celebrate. For those who found themselves dismayed at the mess Faqua made of The Equalizer, fear not, Hajaig's protagonist is not intended to inspire or excite. On another day, Harry may be a companion to Into The Wild's Christopher McCandless, but years of silent brooding have led him into a different kind of action.Hajaig doesn't make the mistake of hoping the audience likes Harry, but the precision with which he makes Harry both vague and determined makes it hard not to go along with him and hope he succeeds, or at least gets away with it. Though there are occasional moments that shock, O'Neill plays Harry as a considered man who blanches at his own actions.Really liked this well made small movie."

","Love the flow of this nice little indie picture, almost zero words uttered through the whole thing, classical storytelling in a a really simple but layered plot.I'd watch again and look for the clues which show your the whole thing is a dream, basically it reminds me of an old Lee Marvin movie, where he gets revenge on a a gang that wronged him but then you realise the whole thionyl is an imagined scenario, and the same goes for this story, he is about to kill himself in a brutal way with a knife on a stool and then we see this image edited through the whole film before violence occurs.He is also an unreliable character in that he is always hallucinating, seeing people about to kill him when he is sleeping, imagining his wife is there just before the violence occurs, and then end of the picture it cuts to the suicide again and then the beach, really cool."

Crucially at specific moments throughout the film it cuts back to him about to commit suicide, and most importantly it does so again this right at the end of the film.The whole film is a death dream and a fantasy of what he would like to happen."

","This super tight 80 minute revenge flick kept me interested, and on the edge of my seat, every single step of the way. I wasn't sure how I initially felt about it while watching but the more time ticked away the more I came to love it. It does kind of make me feel queezy inside at the brutal violence, but I respect movies that can genuinely do that. It's definitely a movie that feels real (like you're watching things that could really happen) and it's also very violent and disturbing; but it also has a significant amount of dark humor (here and there), to keep things entertaining (the laughs never feels forced or unnatural though) and it also has the element of surprise in that is what we are watching real or imagined by Harry? O'Neill's performance is remarkable and Hajaig's directing is superb. It feels a lot like a Coens Brothers' flick, just on a slightly smaller (and lower budget) scale!"

Camera-work is steady, editing is concisely done while Con O'Neill expresses himself amazingly well & delivers a terrific performance as Harry with whom viewers won't have much trouble connecting with.On an overall scale, Vengeance is Mine is an astonishingly well-made independent feature that also qualifies as one of this year's finest films. No single element here is present in excess but just the right dose & even if there are a few nitpicks, they all fall apart when compared to the number of things the director gets right. Simple, composed & patient yet violent, tragic & grim, Vengeance is Mine is thriller at its most elegant."

You are engrossed in the action and the characters without hearing them say what they are thinking or feeling, thats a real skill so kudos to the directing and writing.I see that there is a discussion going on wether its dream or not, I have to say it did niggle me a tad when I was watching it thinking the same thing and to see other people are saying its a dream makes me think, BUT wether its a dream or not its still a clever little movie."

Seedy London stars and is captured perfectly as the ordinary, unglamorous setting for a series of extraordinary events.This is how, I would imagine 99% of us would do killing if we had to - bumbling, incompetently, ineptly and probably with similar such dreadful episodes and conclusions.The direction is taut, vivid and leads one to a feeling of pending, inevitable doom. It is atmospheric and exact. But what a find in the team of Hadi Hajaig, the writer director and Con O'Neill the lead,An indie masterpiece..."

Initially Harry seems like a person at the bottom end of society, living a dull and mundane life as a cleaner at a church with nowhere to go until he finds out the location of the men that killed his wife and daughter. He then transforms from an ordinary non threatening man into an avenging angel of death, but one that retains his humanity as he suffers the affects of going down this violent path. He is not like the tough guy persona we are used to in these films and probably that's what makes this movie better, he is not an over the top macho dude with muscles that happens to be an army vet with catchy one liners. He is just a normal guy."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11650226/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," YEP AGREE, THE WHOLE FILM IS A DREAM. ","From the moment the flashbacks happened at his suicide right at the opening fo the film and then how imagines he sees the the villain in his church , and how every time there is over the top violence he has some sort of vision of his wife next to him or visions of the suicide which opened the film , it is obvious to me that it is all a dream. The nail in the coffin for all of this is the ending, just look what happened when he is at the grave, the flash cut of his suicide, then he ends up on the beach, he has died and those are the random images he sees, its not obvious its a dream but thats what I liked about it was that it kept me thinking about that, and thats what I like about films, its if they keep me thinking long after you watch them."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11650226/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Outstanding Neo-Noir Thriller ","The story is simple but exceeded in its gorgeous storytelling. Several times throughout the movie the director allows the audience to try and piece information together themselves and then finally revealing the final answer. While the sum total of the plot could be, "revenge is not good" the movie is clever enough to have various layered plot points which are intriguing.Con O'Neill's performance as Harry was amazing as he brings out vulnerability in a character we really should not like in the slightest. He's driven by vengeance and does many questionable acts but also shows a guilt to his acts. The supporting cast were really good . I wish I could say more on them but O'Neill's character was really the primary focus and everyone else was in his shadow. I will state Anton Saunders did a menacing job and stole a couple of scenes when he is flipping out as a very creepy and cary villain.The production side was just as good as the acting. There are trappings of a neo-noir plot line and it shows in the filmmaking. Rich shadows, precise camera work, an orange brown tinge fills the scenes. Most of the shots chosen are solely to help maximize plots potential. The special effects used were vicious, one scene I had to view quite a few times because I wanted to figure out how it was achieved.Finally, the ending may be ambiguous or decisive depending on how you view it but for me the ambiguity is what has kept it in my mind, I can't wait to have movie night to show this to all my friends.Well done to the largely unknown director and unknown cast, keep up the sterling work."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11650226/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Astonishing thriller ","Vengeance is Mine is a bare bones thriller that explores the human psychology of revenge. It doesn't recreate the genre but what sets this outstanding thriller apart from tons of other thrillers of its kind is that it is textured with a multi surface plot where you are are engrossed in what is happening and also questioning wether what is happening is real or just the imagination of the protagonist. It doesn't have a super human protagonist, it is bare bones which makes it that much more thrilling.The lead actor Con O'Neill delivers the goods here as well, making us really connect with the character of Harry. One scene in particular that stands out is when Harry has confronted and has shot the first villain and is pointing a gun at him, the villain shot in the stomach and writing down the address of the rest of the gang, Harry takes the paper looks then not wanting to get near the villain says "thats my pen" the villain bleeding throws the pen to him and says "sorry", this line cracked me up. The villain then looks at Harry and says " whats with the gun, it doesn't suit you", the dialogue is surreal and makes it somehow real. It is truly amazing how great a film can be without a huge budget and a big name star.Vengeance is Mine is an astonishing thriller that deserves more attention than it will most likely receive. However, I do see big things coming for the director Hadi Hajaig after this and it makes me much more excited to see what he can bring to other films. Vengeance is Mine is a truly heart pounding revenge thriller that stands out among as one of the most excellent films of its kind. This is an amazing film and I highly recommend it."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11650226/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," High brow genre movie ","A fantastic revenge thriller that uses literally every penny of its micro budget perfectly, as throughout this looks visually as well put together as any other multi million dollar Hollywood production. The way it unravels is nothing other than completely gripping as it is a fine example of pure unencumbered story telling that shows the audience the unfolding evens a lot more than it tells them. Performance wise its top of the line, with Con O'Neill giving one of the most timid, yet still perfectly relatable killer performances, but is the smart direction that sets itself apart as it's faultlessly sharp and immensely effective. A gritty must see that is high brow genre movie."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11650226/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Promising director ","2021 could be the onset of a very promising director named Hadi Hajaig and the beginning of a new genre: the multiple-reality twist movies. The plot seems pretty straight forward at first. Harry (Con 'Neill) is a man living in a old church in London, doing menial tasks and contemplating suicide. One day he is informed of the location of the killers of his wife and daughter. Clearly, he has no intention to turn the other cheek in this case and he sets out to a successful assassination. Remember in the Matrix the big spoiler appears mid film? Or how the gigantic spoiler is close to the finale at "The sixth sense"? This movie is an installation of successive twists and I have to say it's a very effective way to keep the viewer glued to his seat. Hajaig's writing and casting are commendable but not revolutionary but it's the movie's pacing that distinguish him from the multitude of new directors with affordable cameras and editing software. You could argue as to the integrity of some characters in the movie or even question how imperative they are to the plot but when the movie is layered through and Harry's vigilante act appears more and more like a fatal judgment error, a profound experience happens and the viewer's empathy of the main protagonist wanes down. Hajaig's vision of crime drama with moral and reality issues is in fact a breath of fresh air in a stagnant genre and one can forgive the the other way with some character development issues. These issues don't subtract the film's appeal it is just my petty quibbling.This movie is worth seeing and despite its modest budget, doesn't seem shoddy or awkwardly delivered. I won't risk predicting that Hajaig will be a household name in the future but I can safely foresee that although this review (thanks for reading it) it won't be me last about him."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11650226/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Razor Sharp Thriller ","Harry is a loner and, to anyone who would perceive him, a total and utter failure on the bottom rung on society. Living and working in a church as a handyman and cleaner, he occupies his time by reading The Count of Monte Cristo and contemplating suicide in all sort of gruesome ways, throw in visions of his wife an daughter runner in a getaway car by some vicious thieves, you have man at the lowest ebb of his life. Then a private detective he hired brings him news that shakes him from his life ending low. He has been so badly wronged in the past that his life derailed that this is light at tend of the tunnel. The authors of his downfall have now been found. He makes a decision to seek vengeance.This means having to buy a gun and ammunition, stalking the killers and attacking them although he is completely untrained and totally out of shape an entering a world he does not belong in. Once in this world he sets in motion a chain of events that will build up its own momentum, essentially driven by vengeance, lost love and pure emotion.Harry is played by Con O'Neill, an outstanding actor. He excels as the frightened, yet driven man, who is essentially a good person, who has been forced into the role of vigilante avenger. He is able to convey so much tormented emotion in his facial expressions and the use of his eyes that his performance on its own would make this a 5 star film. All of the supporting actors are also excellent, one of the villains played bt Anton Saunders is skin tinglingly scary, but O'Neills performance just dwarfs all around him.This is edge of seat stuff, with brutal violence - intentionally gratuitous, it is the messy sort and sometimes glammed up which at first I thought was strange but then as I watched this over the top violence that SOMETIMES occurred I realised that the film maker was telling us something , THIS IS EITHER A DREAM OR REAL OR BOTH, in that Harry is perhaps committing these acts and exaggerating them in his mind OR in that it is his final thoughts as he lies dying in his room in the church when he tries to commit suicide with a knife strapped to a stool.The movie has a brooding quality that makes the whole thing have a kind of intense effervescence that just grabs you and takes you along for the ride - and that means the whole journey. I was blown away by this, small film. This is a master class in how to make a thriller. I can not recommend highly enough."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11650226/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," The British know how to make it bleed emotions ","A deeply tense and taught thriller that puts you along side Harry as all the events unfold. I am very accustomed to the actions of characters of your typical Hollywood revenge thrillers that in my mind I was intensely screaming at Harry's actions when the **IT, hit the fan. Then the realization came, this is not a film where the lead character becomes a fuel raged unstoppable hero suddenly becoming an expert on how to kill. But another fantastic element is that he is a dream like state and doesn't really know what is going on around him and hallucinates all sorts of imagery in quiet moments and in violent moment. This is why European thrillers are so cool compared to our USA product and the Brits excel at it.The surreal quietness is very intense in this film and you just focus everything on the films characters. That is how excellent the directing and the screenplay are, the movie is not afraid of the silence. You become completely aware of how fast your heart is beating in the deadly silence. The direction by Hadi Hajaig was handled expertly and was a true feast for the eyes. Gorgeous cinematography and his utilization of natural light made it easy to get lost in the movie. There are scenes that will make you wriggle and squirm and there are humorous tension releasing moments, that is how tight the script is and you are relieved that you have those moments. Everyone in this cast is on point, I did not feel one off key from any of actors. The gamut of emotions that run through Harry's (Con O'Neill) eyes alone is worth the price of admission. There are some great actor finds Anton Saunders as an unredeemable and terrifying character in the film. Plaudits to the whole unheard of cast. The score from Sarah Lynch is haunting and never over powers a given scene. I know I am gushing over this movie, but if you can talk and truly think about a film long after the lights have come up then gush I must about it!Do yourself a favor and see it and be kind to your friends and tell them about it and watch it with them. You are guaranteed a long conversation over drinks afterward. This is not a standard revenge film, yes it bleeds a lot of red, but it also bleeds true emotions."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11650226/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Why can't more films be like Vengeance is Mine? ","I so wish more indie movies were like Vengeance is Mine. It makes it look so simple and effortless. Maybe it's because it is in fact simple and effortless. Con O'Neill the lead looks like a blend of a lawyer and an accountant and he is an inept protagonist that the film explores in all its consequences that other movies skip with an archetype that's usually hugely muscled and wielding machine guns on both arms.It's subversive and the ending pays off with a gorgeous finale. While some would get tired of the spare and simple plot, it allows the stakes to rise in a true way and the only thing that is missing is a little more juice on all the cast of characters as the film chooses to not speak unless it really has to which I actually liked. However, the authentic leads acting wins you over where the writing is deliberately minimal.Outside of O'Neill, the highlight is director Hadi Hajaig's visual style, which has such remarkable textured simplicity and that puts all other films today to shame, from the biggest blockbusters to the lowest low budget Indies. Vengeance is Mine reminds me why I have always loved looking for more obscure and smart indie cinema."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11650226/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Grade A movie that should be seen widely ","Audiences are incredibly familiar with revenge films because it is a reoccurring common theme in movies, BUT Hadi Hajaig's Vengeance is Mine is one of those rare movies that feels unique. Vengeance is Mine stands out easily from your standard revenge flicks in various ways. First, we aren't given much of a a background (apart from some rapid flashbacks) of what is going on in the story and as the action takes place we get some hints of what happened to the main protagonist. Second, the main character played by Con O'Neill isn't your typical Hollywood hero. It's evident this dude doesn't know what he is doing and is a total scared amateur. He makes many many mistakes that sometimes it becomes a bit laugh out loud funny. It also shows us his humanity and allows us to identify and really care for him. He is incredibly different from other characters we see in this movie genre that are highly qualified for the violent task (think of Denzel Washington in The Equalizer, or Keanu Reeves in John Wick, or the Charles Bronson Death Wish films). O'Neill's Harry doesn't really know what the hell he is doing but he is ferociously determined to get his revenge. He's a normal guy who has been viciously hurt by a traumatic event in his past. The film takes its time to eventually buildup the character and his actions. It is a quiet and toned down film so when the violent scenes arrive they shock you in their brutality. It also differs from other revenge movies in that we don't see Harry get a sense of joyous satisfaction and his violent actions only complicate things more. Hajaig has managed to craft an incredibly unique revenge film which is more of a steady character study than anything else. He not only directed this film but he was also the writer, producer and editor, so this is entirely his baby.I did not know much about this movie before going into it but I am glad I got a chance to see it because it was quite a unique jarring experience. Con O'Neill delivers an outstanding lead acting performance and he should get offered many more roles in films in the future. The film pretty much entirely revolves around his tragic character and he is practically in every scene of the film. He is what keeps us totally invested in the film during the quieter periods and the few lines he has are delivered pitch perfectly in the film."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11650226/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Vengeance is sweet when juxtaposed ","This flick follows familiar plot patterns but then turns them on their head in that the hero, if he can be called that, is man who is in his 50s, cant fight, cant shoot BUT has a raging anger to reap vengeance.When he attacks its messy, he cant aim right, when there is a knife fight its endless, when he shoots it goes really insane, yep I agree that its his fantasy/dream and he's imagining, but I LOVED THAT JUXTAPOSITION because it leaves you to muse , is it real or is it imagined or is it both ?"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11650226/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Tense and hypnotic ","Like many have already said, there is something of the Coen Brothers about this movie, but not in terms of humor or peculiarity but in its stripped down brutal violence that worked so well in No Country for Old Men. The plot here sees a church cleaner in London, England, UK, learning of the whereabouts of the gang who killed his family. He sets out for violent revenge, but the attempts go badly especially as he is seeing visions around him as he progresses.Starting out in wordless scenes, the film draws us in with Harry revealing a lot of his life and what led him there, all with little touches and moments. We don't understand the full ins and outs of it, but the gist is pretty much clear and it is very engaging. The steady sedate pace of the start continues throughout, it works well to produce tension and build-up within scenes, but also across the movie as a whole. The stripped down style to the writing, soundtrack, and production all add to that tension - it doesn't feel forced or excessive. There isn't a 'side' really, although of course we follow Harry as our way in - but it is the lack of choice that draws the film along just like it does to him.Hajaig and O'Neill are the stars here and they hold the film together. O'Neill in the lead is convincing in his simplicity, and delivers an engaging character whether he is in the church at the start, making bad decisions, or dealing with a mess he has no way out of. Writer/director Hadi Hajaig has a deft touch for brutal tension, with good camera movement and framing when it matters, as well as allowing nothing to happen in scenes at times when there is so much is at stake in the film.Vengeance is Mine was a surprise find as the 79 minute running time fitted my evening. It turned out to be a enthralling but sparsely populated film, which played to its full strengths from start to finish."

For a movie that's slightly technical, it never bores you or glosses over the critical information. Despite the anthological setup, I was fairly invested in Operation Java, its primary characters, and the overall vibe of this crime thriller. 8 stars."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11651550/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," All Hail Malayalam Cinema !!! The Best Cop-Drama EVER made in the History Of Indian Cinema. ","Operation Java (2021) : Movie Review -Cop dramas are supposed to be made for entertainment and mass mania, that's what we say because we have seen such stuff for many years. Many Cop films are made with mass mindset only and only few have been blended with cinematic class. The last i remember is Bollywood thriller flick 'Baby' directed by Neeraj Pandey which had pure cinematic class in it and stayed away from typical mass elements. Enough of Cop films with no classy statements. Malayalam Cinema has cracked a new code of filmmaking in this theme and has redefined the genre forever. Enough of regular cop films where the lead actor will carry out operations on his machoism rather than his intelligence, now it's time for Cyber-Police drama. A high-tech storytelling with thrilling aspects and heartbreaking facts on this bloody system and unknown heroes. Operation Java is a tribute to all those unknown temporary workers of cyber cell and it will surely make you forget all the cop-dramas you have seen in last 60-70 years.The story revolves around a group of officers and a series of mysteries, events and cases reported before them in the Cyber Cell. It is also about how they plan and execute their operations and how senseless those educated people can be when it comes to falling prey to fake digital fraud. The main target of the film is justifying those two temporary officers who works more passionately than the senior permanant officers but never gets credit for what have they done and an awareness for people on how not be believe any tricks, phone calls, mails which can be harmful. Cyber crime is a serious thing actually, it's an easy medium to fool people and because of indirect transitions and fear of losing dignity many people don't even speak out about it. The level of crime is even worse than the regular crimes like theft, money fraud and others. The film also shows us that how this digital fraudism which includes crimes like Movie Piracy, Viral Videos, Online Job Frauds and Digital Money stealing can destroy someone's life in just few minutes. And then at the end it tears your heart apart with emotional take on shattered dreams of passionate guys and the how our system is responsible for that.Performance wise all the actors are brilliant but naturally the leading pair of Balu Varghese and Lukman Avaran is truly superlative. The background score is chilling, it makes those scenes look so gripping and thrilling as if we are seeing a grand crime thriller. Technical aspect of the film are fantastic, not a single letdown anywhere. Dialogues are regular just like any of us would use in our dialy life hence, it connects accurately. The idea of dividing those different operations in proper line-up is one of the major highlight of the film. It begins with Movie Piracy, a thing we cinema lovers are ford of. So, first it engages you with this interesting case and then starts unfolding more serious crime files. That poignant attack on system with the emotional ending is perhaps the best climax you'll ever see in any cop-film.Tharun Moorthy, as director has done achieved something that will be remembered for years. You know, the quality cinema lovers always complaint that a cop-drama can never be classy (those which includes police operations i mean), but with Operation Java Moorthy has broken that myth. Yes, Cop-dramas can be very classy and this film proves it. I mean it's not always about those senseless action flicks and some realistic quality films, but once in a while we can see a film like Operation Java which provides thrill, innovative idea, gripping storytelling, passion, emotions and hard-hitting drama. Overall, Operation Java is the Best Cop-Drama ever made in Indian Cinema. Show me a better cinematic classic than this in Cop genre and I am ready to wait forever.RATING - 8.5/10*"

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11651550/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Malayalam Cinema delivers, Yet again !! ","Operation Java is based on real life cases and investigations undertaken by the cyber cell unit of Kochi police, over a period of a year and half with the help of two engineering graduates. A well written screenplay that involves cases of film piracy, job fraud, and a murder case among others. Operation Java is more of an anthology styled drama but with the same characters involved, as it explores darker side of information technology and it's users. Operation Java, among others also portrays the lives & struggles of temporary, intern, apprentice staff who toil equally hard but don't get proper recognition or financial benefits for their hard work. At the heart of the film lies two issues: cyber crime and joblessness.Full credit to the debutant director Tarun Moorthy in putting together a wonderful well knit thriller that is bound to keep the audiences glued to their seat, his usage of light & darkness is amazing and needs a separate review on its own. Screenplay is very well crafted, right from the introduction of the lead characters and the supporting characters before venturing into the details of the cases, that are very well written. Production design, costumes and makeup are very good. Music and a pulsating EDM score lifts operation Java's tempo further, thanks to Jakes Bejoy. On the acting front Balu Varghese and lukman do a wonderful job as trainees, ably supported by a host of wonderful actors led by Binu Pappu. Shine Tom Chacko delivers a wonderful cameo as CI.Overall, if one is a fan of crime-thriller genre, look no further, As Operation Java is tailored to suit your needs. The movie can be watched entirely with family and is highly recommended to do so to understand the perils of the dark side of technology. The storytelling format is such that it produces the effect of having seen three or four crime thrillers at once. 7.7 stars out of 10 for the sheer pulsating entertainment value, bundled together as a complete package."

Another connection is that our 2 leads are helping in these cases. I loved the last one most. In another hand, the film showed the struggle of temporary staffs who work hard but don't get proper recognition and financial benefits for their work.All three investigations are based on real-life cases, that's why I loved the film even more. There are 3-4 one take shots which were looking so good. Give it a watch, you'll get to know more about Cyber Cell and how it works. I've not seen much films on cyber crime. So, for me it's a brillianty executed film.Available on Zee5. MandalBros."

Noting new here, many cyber crimes related TV series and movies have been made earlier also. Just watch Jamthara on Netflix instead. Total waste of time."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11651550/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Entertaining thriller. ","Debutant Tharun Moorthy has delivered one of the best movies during the pandemic. It has some flaws. Some corny dialogues and morally wrong scenes. But that's me nitpicking.Seems like the director-writer got cheated by his ex. Such female characters are visible throughout the movie. Wish this movie had a good female character as well.All the actors have done a great job. Overall it's a good movie."

","#MovieReview #OperationJava #SpoilerFreeDirector Tharun Moorthy has delivered Malayalam's best crime thriller since Anjaam Paathira, effectively blending together three slice-of-life police investigations to deliver a stylish end product.Lookman and Balu Varghese star as a duo of down-on-their-luck engineering grads who land a temporary internship with the Police Cyber cell using their wit and tenacity.Their efforts in unravelling a set of cunning online crimes and financial frauds form the rest of the story and the fact that these are inspired by real events adds further sheen.The director's dedication to portray the story in as realistic a manner as possible is what makes Operation Java such an excellent watch.Highly recommended."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11651550/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," The biggest and only issue I had this movie was "Shaky camera" , rest is all good, infact very good film. ","Just 10 min down, I was like having this terrible heavy head feeling because of the shaky camera. The cinematography needs lot of work, as they are trying too many things to create suspense, thriller and it's not really required.But overall a very good story, good film, very good acting and BGM, but shaky camera work really needed a help. It's first film I truly enjoyed from Malayalam industry where there is genuine art of story telling, genuine acting, very good story arc, character arc and overall good thing. Kudos to filmmaker, actors , everyone behind this gem film. I would have easily given it 8 or 9 too, but still good to go. I would highly recommend for Malayalam filmmakers if want to do commercial film, this is way to go forward.You got great future actors in the whole cast, and amazing story telling. Loved it."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11651550/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Simple and powerful operation ","Operation Java is an engagingly crafted, true to life account of a series of investigations carried out by a Cyber Cell unit of the Kerala Police, whilst dwelling on its day-to-day activities too. Though it remains simple and uncomplicated in terms of the details of the investigations, it turns out to be emotionally powerful in projection of the plight of temporary employees, who work for the government.Spoilers alert:-Operation Java is a neatly crafted, realistically captured flick, focusing on the events happening in a Cyber Cell unit of the Kerala Police. Presented in an authentic manner, the characters are etched out nicely, providing a few touching moments as well.The plight of temporary employees working for the government, which is one of the main themes of the flick, has been portrayed effectively. Having previously worked for the government on a temporary basis myself, I could abundantly relate to and feel for Antony and Vinaya Dasan. In spite of putting their best efforts, they do not get the deserved recognition, whereas they are subjected to sneering by their "permanent" colleagues. Perhaps, the flick could have ended on a more positive note with the government acknowledging their efforts and retaining them, thus motivating all the dejected and diligent temporary employees out there. But then, what happens is the harsh reality and there's no escaping the same.With regard to the few negatives of the flick, I felt the details of the investigations, are perhaps, too simple to be true and it is as if solving them does not require much technical skills. Sending a newbie for a dangerous field task too, could raise anyone's eyebrows. In spite of such minor flaws, Operation Java succeeds in catching the attention of the viewers, because of its true to life execution, engaging cases and a few emotional elements."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11651550/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Keeps us fully engaged. ","There is never a dull moment in this movie, except for maybe that one song sequence. This manages to make us feel convinced that this is how cyber police in Kerala works. We don't feel like any tech stuff they show is out of place. That is all one needs to ask from such a movie. When most movies show tech stuff in an incorrect way, this is breath of fresh air. It feels grounded in reality.At times it resembled Action Hero Biju. They have stitched together the investigation of several unrelated cyber crime cases in a seamless manner. It's told through the eyes of the two heroes. The story progresses through their viewpoint.The script doesn't lag anywhere. The comic relief we get is not at all forced and feels very organic.The acting is very good. There is no one who did their part in a bad way.The art, costumes, editing departments too did a commendable job.The only problem I found was that there was a bit too much of melodrama in it. The heroes always seem like they are not at all happy about what they got.If you want to watch an entertaining film which doesn't have any dull moment in it, go for this."

Lukman takes the field to another level with his eloquence in a crucial scene that presents an emotional storyline through dialogue.But the film does not revolve around them, it goes completely through the script and the making.The film begins with Alphonse's son's 'Premam' becoming a huge success and its censor copy being leaked on the internet.Antony and Vinayak Das are approaching SHO Prathap of the Cyber Wing in Kochi with the conclusion that the route found by the police is not behind it.The first part of Java is that the inspector, impressed by these guys ability, conducts the investigation the way they say.The film falls on track from the very first frame as it is an investigation of an incident that is familiar and interesting to the Malayalee.Gathering the audience as well. Java can be used from the beginning to create the impression that it can do justice to the hype received onlineRealistic and smart cyber police operations make the film worthwhile.The director manages to keep the audience curious throughout the operation. Nowhere does it seem like the work of a newcomer, says Tarun Murthy.Scripting Excellent. Making it's a step ahead.You can feel the exact homework behind it on the screen.Operation Java is another film in which a talented director emphasizes that, actors are not an essential element.As mentioned earlier, it is not the path of these two that is advancing in the investigative paths of cyber policing.Irshad has the full versatility of a cyber-wing station head. Binu Pappu and Prashant Alexander performed well.Operation Java came to an unexpected end.The compulsion to be realistic keeps the dramatic expectations of the traditional audience at bay.The film ends with the submission of millions of temporary / contract basic / daily wage employees in the Kingdom of India.A dedication that hooks somewhere inside."

Bruce Willis and Megan Fox play FBI agents working a sting operation in the same area. They meet up with local law enforcement agent Emile Hirsch who is unofficially working the case of a serial killer. Willis is old and tired so Fox and Hirsch do the footwork to catch Lukas Haas who we know is the killer from early in the feature.The plot is straight forward and predictable. I believe Willis is actually dead and is being propped up like "Weekend at Bernie's" with his voice cut from old films. Fox shows off her legs in the opening scene. Hirsch really put himself into the role even if no one else did.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity in a film about prostitutes."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11656220/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt"," Looking for a serial killer along I-10 in Florida. ","There was a TV series "Columbo" in the 1970s starring Peter Falk. The novelty was the viewer learned of the murder as the show began and the entire episode was to see how Columbo would go about picking up clues and solving the crime.This movie isn't quite that clean cut but we do get very strong suspicions very early, soon confirmed, and we watch to see how the agent will unravel clues and solve the crime. The setting is the panhandle of Florida, communities along I-10, and a series of murders of young girls and women are discovered.There are many very unfair reviews rating this movie as "1" and "don't waste your time" comments. But looking at the actual distribution of ratings "5" is the most common and probably where I would rate it. There is nothing outstanding here but it is mostly well made movie that is about as enjoyable as an extended TV episode of a crime story.My wife and I watched it at home on DVD from our public library. It was not filmed in Florida, most was filmed in Puerto Rico. It was strange in the end credits seeing they had a "COVID-19 medical team.""
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11656220/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," Just another run-of-the-mill crime thriller... ","I just sat through the 2021 crime thriller "Midnight in the Switchgrass", and I must say that while the movie definitely was watchable, it was ultimately just a very generic crime thriller.Sadly so, yeah, the storyline and script in "Midnight in the Switchgrass", as written by Alan Horsnail, just didn't offer anything new to the crime thriller genre, and it was actually a rather predictable and generic formula that was used to construct the movie. So you knew the outcome early on in the movie actually.This movie does have some good names on the cast list, but the movie was carried primarily by actors Emile Hirsch and Lukas Haas. The movie also had Bruce Willis and Megan Fox on the cast list, and I must admit that I was initially lured into watching "Midnight in the Switchgrass" because it had Bruce Willis on the cast list. But it turned out that he didn't really have all that big of a role to play in the movie. Now, a lot can be said about Megan Fox, but I think she actually managed to do a good job in this movie."Midnight in the Switchgrass" is a rather slow paced crime thriller, which makes certain aspects of the storyline feel prolonged and slow.I sat through the entire movie, and yeah, it ended exactly as I predicted it would early on in the movie. So nothing overly surprising to be experienced here from director Randall Emmett.My rating of "Midnight in the Switchgrass" lands on a very mediocre five out of ten stars."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11656220/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","2"," Misleading subpar thriller ","Featuring Bruce Willis on the cover and given top billing, we come to realize that isn't the case. As he is in a smaller supporting role. Emile Hirsch is essentially the lead here, along with Megan Fox.This film is quite lazy, with bad writing, average acting and quite slow at times. It does get better in the second half but also the conclusion feels a little rushed.Watching this film reminded that of the tv series True Detective, but nowhere near the level."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11656220/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt"," This little gem was put together by a first time writer and director? Wow. ","Well known producer Randall Emmett I guess decided to get hands dirty on set with filmmaking, and this film was his first ever dabble in that department as director. He did not disappoint. Then add amateur writer Alan Horsnail - his first ever involvement in the film industry, and these two newb filmmakers gave us something pretty darn impressive.Sure it wasn't perfect, and when you see the name "Bruce Willis", you naturally are prepared for disappointment, but I was pleasantly surprised with his performance - finally. Then you have Megan Fox in her last film "Till Death", of which was an impressive movie, but her acting was stale, and I couldn't get over her "perfect make-up" even in the dirtiest of scenes. Well wow to Ms. Fox, she acted like a champ in this one, and I'm thinking her most convincing role in a long time. Bonus: her hair an make-up actually weren't perfect, so she even looked the part. For that matter, all casting and performances were great, especially Lukas Haas who creeped the creepy dude quite well. Even Fox's new beau Colson Baker aka Machine Gun Kelly's performance was awesome. It was good to see Sly's daughter Sistine play her role so well.The pacing was decent, and the 99 min runtime flew buy with lots of tension and suspense. I didn't know this was based on true events, so that made Emile Hirsch's character that much more impressive. There were very few plot and technical issues - impressive for newb filmmakers, and I found the screenplay flowed effortlessly and with solid continuity. There may have been some editing issues in some scenes, but that can easily be overlooked considering the newbs. The cinematography was great, and the music and score spot-on. Mad props to Emmett and Horsnail for this little gem, which was way more impressive than I expected, and thus, well deserving of my 8/10."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11656220/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," VIEWS ON FILM review of Midnight in the Switchgrass ",""It'll be dark soon." So says a subdued murderer in Midnight in the Switchgrass (my latest review). "Switchgrass" is Florida Panhandle noir with a little deep-fried twang. Its plot may be conventional (law enforcement officials track down a serial killer) but there's some style to boot.Bruce Willis and Megan Fox are on the front of the poster for "Switchgrass." Willis, well you wouldn't even know he was in the movie unless you saw said poster. Brucie has about 7-10 lines (which I'm guessing comes out to be about $100,000 per line). With a little nudge, he just manages to get those lines out.As for Fox, well except for creating an interesting persona in 2012's This Is 40, Megan ain't much of an actress. Midnight in the Switchgrass isn't an awful film but it shows that Willis and Fox should probably never appear on screen together ever again."Switchgrass" is a flick that caters more to the deep performances by Emile Hirsch (he plays an FDLE agent) and Lukas Haas (he plays a sluggish psychopath). I guess they weren't sexy enough choices to headline the poster like Willis and Fox. Haas, who usually doesn't carry an entire film, does decent work here as menace Peter. It's strange seeing him in this type of role considering that he mostly panders to cameos and bit parts.Midnight in the Switchgrass is directed by Randall Emmett. Emmett is normally a producer so this represents his first time behind the camera. Randall revels in stark images, flashbacks, weaving character arcs, and overhead shots. You can tell he doesn't want to be the bearer of direct-to-video gifts (which he kind of is). Sadly Emmett wants "Switchgrass" to be art but it's faux art. Oh well, I'll give him points for trying. Lipstick on a pig is better than no lipstick at all."

The story is very dumb, and every interaction between characters made me cringe. I once watched an unwatchable movie once where Dane Cook was a PhD in Engineering. Megan fox as a qualified undercover cop ranks up there with that viewing.Overall, don't waste your time. The acting is incredibly bad, forced and everything is rushed, despite there being no thrills or feeling of excitement. I could not hate the wife characters in this more. If this movie wasn't written as a joke (and I don't think it was,) then it is really pure garbage. If you think you want to see this story play out, in this environment, watch True Detective.This is so awful it makes me feel bad for the millionaire actors who look so stupid in this, and that's saying a lot.Skip this garbage."

Bruce Willis's desperate need for cash.He so nonchalantly delivers his telegraphic lines, that you can't help but think he was having a ball by making money so easily.

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11657662/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," Adequately entertaining... ","I am not a head-over-heels fan of "The Witcher" franchise, though I found the Netflix series to be entertaining. So I wasn't really overly thrilled about this 2021 animated foray into the franchise. But as the opportunity to sit down and watch it presented itself, of course I did so.And yeah, "The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf" certainly was watchable, but it wasn't something that made me sit with raised arms and being particularly thrilled or excited. But I found this animated movie from writer Beau DeMayo to be adequately entertaining.The storyline was pretty straight forward, though it wasn't something that mentally challenges the audience. You simply just lean back, much on the snack and watch the movie unfold on the screen. Certain things in the storyline felt rushed, if not casually brushed over, which was a shame, because a more thoroughly thought through plot would have added to the overall enjoyment.The art style that they opted to use for "The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf" was good. It felt like a mixture between traditional animated movie style, say the 1980s cartoons, and mixed in with a dash of Anime. It worked out well enough, and wasn't boring to look at.With "The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf" being an animated movie, of course having a proper voice cast is alpha and omega. And they did have an okay ensemble of voice performers to portray the various roles and characters here. Mostly talents that I wasn't familiar with, aside from Graham McTavish.All in all then "The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf" is watchable, but I think it has a wider appeal to the hardcore fans of the franchise than it does for someone like me, a casual viewer.My rating of director Kwang Il Han's "The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf" lands on a five out of ten stars."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11657662/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," It was very good, with a gripping story, if slightly off canon ","A lot of the bad reviews here are about how the film did not respect the canon. Tears, finger gestures and other such nonsense. If you care more about the canon than the story, I guess you should not watch this film. However, if you like compelling characters, good animation and an epic storyline, then this is for you. I have read the books and I have played the games: whoever thinks there is a canon that holds them both is inside an illusion.Now about the film. It's not perfect, but for me it was well close. The animation is good, barring some lazy 3D in some fight scenes, the voices are perfect, the story is beautiful and sad - the scene when he says he is also 70 was great, tons of action like in the games, but also focus on the actual morals and emotions of the characters, like in the books. The ending was epic, but very rushed. A lot of the film was setting it up, to see it end so abruptly was kind of jarring. Also logic was a bit strained there.The story is a prequel, a bit of origin for Geralt, how he became such a goody two shoes, and also explaining why Kaer Morhen is in ruins in his time. The books are not clearly explaining how the hold was destroyed other than say it was a bunch of fanatics spurred and helped by mages, which is consistent with the film. I liked the Netflix Henry Cavill series, but the many characters and random timelines threw me off a little. This film brings a little normality to the franchise, even if it, too, has a lot of flashbacks.Also, apparently, this film sets up the second season of the Witcher. I find the character of Kitsu intriguing, a seed for possible continuations, a creature of such power should have an effect on the world and, being a witcher/monster/elf hybrid, should have a life span allowing her to live to Geralt's time. At least the concept of elven witchers (perhaps bread to battle humans) is great and should be explored further.Bottom line: keep these witchers coming! Can't wait for December 21."

This movie is a prequel to the series where we followed Vesemir and learned more about how Witchers were made.This was again another fun and action packed fantasy. Unlike Geralt, who was more calm, Vesemir was a carefree ranger, who gave me the vibes of Castlevania's Trevor Belmont. I liked his character, as well as his bittersweet relationship with his childhood lover, which was similar to Steve Roger and Carter.Although the movie started slow, it effectively showed how unapologetically brutal the training process was to become a Witcher. Lots of blood were shed, children and adults alike, and overall felt like a bottleneck effect.Continuing with the actions, the last half became a lot better with intense and twisty battles that were amazingly entertaining. The animation style was similar to other Netflix shows with the same genre, and it worked well as always. The ending was sad, but featured a fun cameo.My problem besides the slow beginning was that the movie felt like 3 episodes condensed into a movie. There were clear transitions between each arc. Also, the movie felt a bit long despite its short runtime of less than an hour and 20 minutes.Overall, a fun side story that added something to the Witcher universe. 8/10."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11657662/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","2"," The Witcher: Disappointment ","Another disappointment. This film has almost nothing to do with the Slavic mythology on which these stories originated.Another mediocre production full of clichs that today's producers have to put in almost every film. The characters are generic and boring, the same in almost every modern film production.The animation isn't bad and the voice actors are interesting, but that's about it. The story is boring and generic, as are most of the characters.The characters are only there to meet the demands of the producer, to whom some other things are obviously more important than the story. The potential is great, but like most of today's film production, this film is a complete failure. Most of the film is boring, and the dialogues are hilarious as is the plot itself.The story and atmosphere do not have a Slavic feeling at all, a total disrespect for an interesting mythology and culture.The Witcher universe really has a lot of potential, if it was another producer, this might then become one of those masterpieces that would be debated for decades, and this way it turned out to be just another disappointment.Unfortunately, another disappointment and mediocre production that has almost nothing to do with the original material."

Also the woke/diversity angle is a bit on the nose/forced. Though this is a fantasy tale so I do not really agree with criticism regarding about inaccuracies about there being black noble families here, this is not a historical documentary.All in all nothing like the game which with every moment drew you in more and you wanted to play more and more.

If you compare this to Romper Stomper or Fight Club, you will appreciate what I mean. Both of those films revolve around violence with a purpose ... or even V for Vendetta.I would not recommend this for sensitive younger viewers. I enjoyed it enough to watch it a few times."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11657662/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," Not really a Witcher universe ","Anything connected to Witcher universe is widely awaited by the loyal fans of superb Witcher 3 video game. I can also mention books, but to be honest very few people read the books before the game came out. Obviously the series that came out at Netflix wasn't the reason. It's still Netflix quality series after all.Cartoon is decent, but few things come to mind almost immediately. There were never Black royalty families in that universe. The monsters are completely different. The Witchers aren't anime ninjas.All in all it just doesn't give that Witcher feel. So it may be a decent cartoon, but it's all wrong.So I'll give it a 5/10 stars at best. Try better Netflix and stop forcing unneedy diversity or general modern agendas into this amazing universe. It's much better without your adaptation."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11657662/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," Criminally Good ","If you thought the Henry Cavill led "Witcher" 2019 series was good, wait till you get a load of this one. "Nightmare of the Wolf" put the spotlight on Geralt of Rivia's mentor and father-figure Vesemir. In this animated movie, Vesemir's a young Witcher killing monsters for coin - in keeping with his trade and training.Kwang Il Han's direction did wonders for each scene in this film based on the super-interesting novels - that also inspired the hit game - written by Andrzej Sapkowski. "Nightmare" had an accompanying writer, Beau DeMayo, who gave the IP an interesting twist. I loved how they applied a 'corruption and conmanship among Witchers' theme (rather, scheme) to the core plotline.Plenty of notable characters made themselves known. Voicing them were an equally amazing cast. Theo James made Vesemir feel alive and inspiring. Lara Pulver gave Tetra Gilcrest a powerful presence. Mary McDonnell brought class and wisdom to Lady Zerbst - who became my favourite character in "Nightmare".Graham McTavish's Deglan (Witcher master) and Tom Canton's Filavandrel (the elf) were splendid. Aside from these, there are other talented voice-cast names on the roster - especially and including young Vesemir (voiced by David Errigo Jr.) and his fellow Witcher-trainees. Harry Hissrich, son of "The Witcher" showrunner Lauren Schmidt Hissrich, voiced young Geralt - who was not the main focus of this film, and that's a good thing.The Animation department worked excellence into each frame. It was a 'make or break' factor in this feature based on a super-popular franchise, and I am happy to say they made it work. The pacing, gore, creature design, and realism they imparted to this tale was nothing short of admirable.Musical scoring (composition and performance) by Brian D'Oliveira lent brilliant artistic flavour and storytelling flair to "The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf" for Netflix. The tunes composed were hauntingly orchestral.This movie is an excellent 'origins' tale centred around the amazing character Vesemir and his experiences, which include his prepping and upbringing at Kaer Morhen under then-master Deglan who trained him in the 'School of the Wolf'. To not see this brutal and beautiful, candid and realistic animated film would be a crime against Witchers everywhere, and this outstanding IP in particular."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11657662/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," 5 minutes of woke nonsense at the start, but the rest is great. ","Skip the first 5-8 minutes of the film. The rest is really great.I wont spoil any of the good stuff because its worth a watch and enjoyable whilst a bit hard to get into a first since its a very different type of witcher we're seeing yet thats also the point.At the beginning however we follow 5 out of place characters that ethnically make no sense. Clearly part of the political mandate to include diverse characters.The thing is that it's coming across as both annoying, insulting and plain hilarious at the exact same time.Quite inginuous writing if intended.You got this family that logically can only be from Zerrekania. Why they are here makes no sense and is never explained. Furthermore why the hell would a nobleman travel so damn far... with his ENTIRE family, without any guards and assitance in a monster and bandit filled world.These are literally your only ethnically diverse characters in the entire film, shoe-horned in because 2021 nonsense. But instead of actually doing anything respectful with them per all this agenda stuff, they just kill them all off, minus a kid who gets side-lined after 5 minutes so he might've as well died too.It's absolutely hilarious to watch because all except the twitter people are sick and tired of the contemporary IRL stuff impacting our entertainment, and seemingly the netflix writers are as well and just got the mandate check-marked and then proceeded with the real story which was about the witcher universe and not some woke irrelevancy that has no business in our escapism and established universes.I'll give it a 7 out of 10. Ducking it a point because of the woke stuff, but at the same time maybe I should give it 8 anyway because it made me laugh how totally indifferent they were to the mandate. It's so painfully obvious by now that nobody cares about the politics at all over there. It's all about appeasing the keyboard warriors and silly media.That said though, it's still a 7, because it's actually racist of Netflix to still push this diversity only to result in acting as a complete meat-shield. Not progressive at all. Just makes people of colour in your entertainment act as tokenistic checkmarks.Thats not cool at all.Make another film, give us original zerekkanian witchers and have all the people of color you want. Make it authentic within the lore and make something cool that is respectful to people of color instead of this ridiculous trend.Its the easiest thing to get natural diversity right.It's legitimately embarassing and hilarious, Netflix. But thanks for the 1 armed red headed witcher ! Some people hated on him but i thought he was cool tbh."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11657662/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," The Witcher isn't set in the middle ages of Europe ","Ill start with my title as some other reviewers seem to think that this is the case. Unfortunately there were no Elves, Mages, Witches, Magic or Monsters or any sort of mystical things as such in the Middle ages in Europe. There were however dark skinned people, they would travel along the continent ( of Europe ) selling goods from China and India to Europe. There were also African people trading from Zanzibar to Europe.However the Witcher series isn't set in Europe or the Middle ages or Dark ages. It is in fact set on the Continent ( which does look a little like Northern Poland )in a time period not of our own. This means there are Elves, Witches, Mages, Magic and of course Dark skinned people from Zerrikania.In this film it opens with some Zerrikanians getting slaughtered....Now onto the film, this is the story of Vesimir, his witcher training and his current predicament. Its a semi love story but more so deals with how witchers are trained and also the animosity from the citizens of The Continent towards Witchers.This is driven however by a female mage who really hates witchers.One has to remember that Witchers are not really good guys nor are they bad guys, they are sub human genetically modified ( using magic ) beings that go through a barbaric process to become who they are.This of course leaves them a bit unempathetic and unemotional but as we know they are not totally devoid of these traits.This film touches on these ideologies as well as the longer life that witchers have.I have read some reviews that question the ending being true to the books although the section they talk about is mentioned fleetingly in the books and for me this film fits with what was written in that short paragraph,I'm not a huge fan of Animation but this was ok, the voice acting can sometimes be a little bit too 'animation'. This can lead to things becoming a bit to comical which takes away the dark edge of the story. Visually however it was quite pleasant.As a little prequal to the books and the films with a fairly open licence on those events its decent and enjoyable but doesn't really give us more insight into the Witcher world than what we already know. Its more of a homage to Vesimir but also highlights more questionable actions of Witchers past.I presume this was made to give people an introduction to Vesimir who are not familiar with the books or games.A 7/10 as a witcher fan would be my score maybe for someone who is not so much a fan they may find it a little pointless.One question though How old was Vesemir before Imlerith snapped his neck."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11657662/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Not bad at all. ","To nonplayers like me it gives a bit of background of The Witcher series.

The presentation right from the first frame gives you the vibes of The Witcher series back from 2019. The characters and the elements feel like a fine glass of wine and versatile. The thing that makes the witcher series eye-catching is the dynamic and branching storytelling from the beginning to end and that spell didn't fade in this movie also. The flow of the story feels little predictable at a few points, so does the ending but everything can be ignored in front of this glorious presentation. The editing and transitions feel polished enough for this content. Director Kwang Il Han has done a wonderful job putting together all this and so do the screenwriters, writing this wonderful stuff. Overall it's a film you definitely wanna enjoy on your weekend with a glass of wine along with your friends."

The plot is negligible and by far the weakest component of this one, while the performances are nothing to write home about. In between the action sequences it really stalls to the point it's quite difficult to watch. But the amount of action is quite incredible, it's the most action dominated movie I've seen in a while, and the brisk fight chroeography is decent too. Plenty of action and killing as our slick hero effortlessly dispatches goon after goon. A good mix of gun fights and hand to hand combat along with some makeshift weaponry and even a sword duel at the climax. Switch off your brain and enjoy this one."

","This film wasn't too shabby considering it was put together by novice filmmakers, but the issues in the writing was an easy fix. It was too melodramatic to the point of borderline childish scenarios, with major continuity issues, plot-hole riddled screenplay, choppy scenes, and it was overly predictable. The fights were decent, for a B film, but there were some that were just ridiculous and unrealistic - nowhere near John Wick action sequences that someone compared this film with. Nevertheless, it was entertaining, especially considering the slim-pickings out there for action films."

He then sets out to kill anyone in his way , then you have some idea of what Xtreme is like.I really enjoyed this .Basically it's a martial arts movie set in Barcelona but with much more gore and death than the average Kung Fu flick .It is a highly choreographed film , which is why I compared it to John Wick and it looks fantastic on Netflix UHD.It does have the feel of a computer game at times with one after another taking on Max the mental geriatric hit man and each dropping like flies but I was thoroughly entertained throughout.There are some good performances from Teo Garcia , who as far as I can see has done nothing on screen before this film , and Oscar Jaenada who plays the evil brother , obsessed with Japanese culture .If you like violent revenge movies then you will love this . If you don't , then I wouldn't bother .Available on Netflix."

Also the bad guys queue to fight the protagonist and been beaten up.Those clichs are in almost any recent action movie so do not look surprised. In any case XTREME is very violent; fights are quite more realistic and blood and some gore are everywhere.On top of that there are a couple of very nasty, very very bad guys and somber hero. scar Jaenada is cynical and terrifying and Sergio Peris-Mencheta is very nasty as coldest killer you can ever imagine. Both were the bad guys in the last RAMBO movie and here are even better (or I must say worse?).Teo Garcia as the should-be-dead -but-came-back-for-vengeance has very good physical aptitudes and able to make very good fights. What else can you look for ?In brief; compared with other NETFLIX action production is the one of the best."

He ordered a hit to kill Max that resulted in Max's son getting killed.What I liked about this film is that it had no shame of being dark and brutal. This film showed no mercy for the people that got killed.You get your fair share of kung fu fights and most people get roughed a lot. One of the over the top action stunts includes a guy getting hit by a speeding car and, in the next day, he is just fine.I guess fighting stunts are not my thing anymore. Some fights just take forever, especially when you know the main character will turn out ok.The final showdown was disappointing because it lacked the same brutality the overall film has. It seemed like a child's play compared to the other facts that happen in the film.If you like action films with an 80-ish style, lots of stunts, and testosterone, add this to your playlist."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11658120/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," The beauty of martial art ","Another movie of "muscles-are-stronger-than-mind". This subgenre was once very popular in the 80s and 90s. So first things first this movie gives me an impression of a long-gone nostalgia. And indeed we could probably dedicate it to the martial art stars in that era.Muscles are stronger than mind. Ok, so we can forget about the plot. Not a single minute of the movie makes sense at all, and so not a single minute can i find any cops in the movie. It's a gangsters world and the baddies can do whatever they want. And Max is a superhero specialised in combat skills so he never dies.If you wanna enjoy 2 hours of Adrenalin-pumping actions, then thats pretty much all you can expect. Go for it n have a good time. If you yell and get sleepless for plotholes, do NOT even take a glimpse of it. Not even a long range shot will u like it.I would recommend it to my friends who love martial art movies."

Fight sequences - 9, some gun fights (yawn), lots of martial arts (yay), and stabbing, lots and lots of stabbing.3. Story line - 6, enough to hold 1 and 2 together.Acting not graded, mostly irrelevant, the heroes are always the same, don't kill in cold blood (this one has plot convenient lapses), look like you are about to lose then triumph. Villains are the only ones who seem to have fun in these types of movies and this one was over the top."

","Don't know who Mr Garca is, apparently he's a cool martial artist, and in this interesting film, you see a lot of it. I'm always fascinated by the rule that a group of a hundred bad guys will patiently wait to approach him one-by-one to get their ass kicked.The usual trope premise of some former hitman who really is a good guy but his young son gets murdered and he befriends some whiney wannabe teenager whose family got murdered and now he's off to murder the murderers. Ms Duro is a bright sliver of light here, the "sister" who has money & computers despite the evolving creepy sexual tension between the two of them. Glad they saved any consummation for the potential sequel.There are worse ways to kill two hours. Props for a technically brilliant English overdub - you really can't tell this movie was what, Spanish? The only time I actually laughed out loud was when the main bad guy was speaking Japanese. Pretty hilarious accent. Ignore it and enjoy the gore."

It will lead to a legendary underground city of gold. He goes after the treasure and a rival group goes too as bump heads along the way.It was an interesting film. I felt I was watching an old Indian Jones western with werewolves. It was well put together with insignificant items in the opening tie neatly into the end. Good characters.Guide: F-word. Brief sex. No nudity."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11666128/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Mixed bag of genres - loved it! ","Well now, this is not what I expected. This certainly is a mixed bag of genres, and dare I say I believe it mixed pretty well.This is probably the type of movie I've been waiting for: an action adventure fantasy western horror drama thriller. That might be a mouth full, but this film really surprised me. The film features really good performances, good dialogue, good cinematography, and an eerie and foreboding atmosphere. We have cowboys, Indians, good guys, bad guys, skin walkers, monsters... I guess this won't satisfy everyone's palate, but I was thoroughly entertained.We follow three officials in search of pieces of an amulet that - according to legend - contains a map to a city of gold. These pieces are scattered, and the only person who knows where they are, is Doloroas, whose ancestors created the amulet, so she's along for the ride as well. On their journey, they stumble across more unsavory characters than they can handle, and their every move is a fight for survival.I love treasure hunting movies. Now add the Western adventure element and I'm in heaven! I really loved this. If you're looking for an old-fashioned Western movie, though, this is not it. This is a very different kind of Western, so you're either going to love it or hate it.Would I watch it again? Yes."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11666128/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," A decent Western ","Potter's Ground is one of the more interesting indies I've viewed lately and I think that its deserving of attention. The story is a simple one, which works for it as much as it works against it but it undoubtedly manages to deliver on the fun.With a cast of mostly unknown actors and a crew of people you have never heard of, we should all appreciate that something was put out that is clearly punching above its weight class. The action works when it wants to, the jokes mostly land, and the movie flows at a mostly even pace that makes it fly by and never bores.My only complaint would be the idea of the monsters in the world. They are alluded to on more that one occasion when referencing a supposedly terrifying location that they must travel to and you even get to catch a glimpse one or two times in the movie, but they are lacking everywhere else. This isn't necessarily a big problem, but it feels at times like Potter's Ground would like to be a monster movie but is scared to give in, ultimately building excitement for something that never comes. If not for this minor disappointment I would probably rate the movie 8.Either way it isn't a bad find on Amazon and is worth the rental if you find yourself in search of easy entertainment."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11666128/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Just enjoy the moment! ","Yes, it is not the best western movie I've seen and in a way it doesn't entirely match its description of a Western, Drama, Thriller.It was certainly dramatic, 100% it had a thriller twist to it and was it's set as a western, but what you don't know is the real twist in the tail - at the end. It was actually almost the lowest point of the film for me.I checked out the actors' bios and it appears that these people have hardly worked on set - at all. Which I find truly amazing as some of the work was simply excellent.The clichs and regular quips were corny to the max, but so well delivered. Brilliant. Isaiah Stratton (lead), his cohort Scott Crain, Todd Bush and Katharine Franco all deserve bigger and better roles in the future.If you are prepared to case aside any concerns and simply go with the flow with this film, I feel confident you will like it. I sure did."

","Potter's Ground is a fun and exciting throwback to classic adventure movies a la Mr. Spielberg and Lucas. Don't let that fool you though, as it also has enough dark and mature elements to give everybody something to be pleased with by the end of the experience.The script is written with such rapier wit and the cinematography should be inspirational for anybody looking to create a film on a minimal budget. All of the talent here is exceptional in their delivery, with the standouts being writer/actor Scott Crain and actress Katharine Franco.Mr. Butts has already delivered in the past with successful short films and, with this, he has managed to prove himself as a filmmaker who is able to adequately make that difficult transfer of talent from shorts to features.Don't sleep on this one. You won't come across much better in the world of low budget filmmaking. That's a promise that I can say with confidence will be lived up to."

"Potter's Ground" is an impressive feature debut that's worth a look for fans of westerns and suspense thrillers.Looking forward to the next production from this team!"

The directior/producer Michael Butts was another highlight! His artistic and well thought out approach to filmmaking is inspiring and is much needed in this business. The other standouts for me was lead protagonist Alexander Kane, writer/actor Antagonist Scott Crain and the little promising newcomer Lexi Janicek.

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11666128/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," A suprisingly funny, strange, pulpy Western done with style ",""Potter's Ground" is an odd beast: part Western, part Thriller, part Supernatural Adventure, this is the kind of film that can only be indie, because no big studio would know how to market the damn thing.But, this frankensteining of various genres is what makes it interesting. In less capable hands, this genre-shift would be jarring. But because of the tight pace and cracking dialogue courtesy of director Michael Butts, Editor Josh Shreve, and writer (and co-star) Scott Crain, you, along with the band of outlaws you're following throughout the film, just kind of accept that weird things are afoot in the Wild West.In this way, "Potter's Ground" reminds me quite a bit of John Carpenter's or Sam Raimi's early outings. Without the money for expensive set pieces (although the set pieces that ARE here are quite good, especially considering the budget), the focus is more on the characters and the dialogue.The movie rarely stumbles (there's a dodgy effect at one point, but no worse than some of the stuff I've seen $500,000,000 movies try to get away with), and never falls flat. It's also refreshing to see the well-worn "outlaws hunt for treasure" trope flipped a little and given some new life.Most of the cast and crew are either brand-new to feature filmmaking, or have very few credits to their names. This is a tad surprising given how strong this movie is.Is this movie for everyone? No. The multi-genre approach can be off-putting if you're looking for a more straightforward Western, and the dialogue is designed more for sheer coolness and effect rather than realism. At the same time, this IS a movie about Aztec gold and ancient curses, so I'm really not sure why you would be watching in the first place if you wanted something along the lines of "Deadwood".In short, I believe this film is the beginning of quite the career for its cast and crew. Only time will tell, but if they can do what they did with the shockingly low budget this film had, they'll knock it out of the park with something more substantial."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11666128/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Well done ","Shockingly well done if you know what the budget was (like practically nothing).
