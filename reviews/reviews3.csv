"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10265034/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," A bot of a slow-moving introspective. ","Robin Wright is "Edee", a rather naive woman who decides that she wishes to live the life of an hermit well off the beaten track in Wyoming. Initially well stocked with tins and logs, her idealistic lifestyle begins to go a little pear-shaped as the wintry weather brings home to her just how ill-equipped - both physically and psychologically - this lady is for her new, downright hostile, environment. It is purely by luck that she is assisted by a neighbour "Miguel" (Demin Bichir) and a (platonic) relationship slowly develops between them. The nature of this friendship slowly allows the story to pad out; we discover more of the causes of her self-imposed isolation, and of her motivation and to that end Wright delivers in the lead role well and fully. The scenery is beautiful, and the winter scenarios make you want to reach for a duvet. Unfortunately, the film lacks for pace - it takes far too long for us to be let into the secrets, and the ending adds salt to an already open wound - for the sake of it, as far as I could make out. This is a film that I'd recommend you watch, just because it clearly demonstrates a poignant style of acting we rarely see nowadays, but wait for the telly at Christmas and it will do you fine."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10265034/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," it takes another person ","Greetings again from the darkness. In her 35 year career, Robin Wright has created many memorable big screen roles, including: Princess Buttercup in THE PRINCESS BRIDE (1987), Jenny in FORREST GUMP (1994), and Antiope in the WONDER WOMAN franchise. She entertained many of us as the complex Claire Underwood in "House of Cards", a series for which she also directed 10 episodes. However, this is Ms. Wright's feature directorial debut, and she also stars in this introspective story from co-writers Jesse Chatham and Erin Dignam.City slicker Edee (Ms. Wright) decides to go "off the grid". Through flashbacks we are able to intuit that she is grieving deeply, and both her therapist and sister (Kim Dickens) are concerned about her suicidal tendencies. Edee loads up a U-Haul trailer and in the ultimate sign of 'dropping out of society', she ceremoniously dumps her cell phone in a trash can. The road takes her to the Rocky Mountains region of Wyoming, where she plops down the money for a remote ... extremely remote ... rundown cabin with a breathtaking view. At this point, we question both her sanity and reasoning.Through Edee's visions we catch glimpses of a man and young child, whom we can assume are her husband and son. An unknown devastating family tragedy, and realization that therapy is not the answer, have driven her to the point of needing to be alone with her pain - to get away from people. Of course, the harsh reality is that she doesn't know how to live off the land, and no "how to" book is going to teach her to chop wood, or hunt, trap and fish, much less survive the forces of nature. A visit from a bear ensures a shortage of supplies, and the brutal wintry cold combines to leave Edee wondering whether she will freeze to death before she starves to death.Did she expect to die on this mountain or did she honestly think this life could rehabilitate her spirit to live? Would changing the view from skyscrapers to a majestic mountain range be enough to help her escape the darkness? Well, we never really get the answers, thanks to the just-in-time arrival of a hunter named Miquel (Oscar nominated Demian Bichir, A BETTER LIFE, 2011), who, along with local nurse Alawa (Sarah Dawn Pledge) help Edee regain her health after near death.Miguel and Edee forge a bond as he teaches her the realities of living off the land. They exchange very little dialogue, but it's clear Miguel is dealing with his own form of suffering. He's a very practical and patient man, and when teaching her how to trap, he states, "Eating squirrels is motivation to get a deer." Can one person help another person re-discover the will to live? That's really the message of the film. We may prefer to be alone with our grief, but it's connecting with others that gives life meaning. As with Miguel and Edee, that connection may simply be someone "in my path".As you might imagine, the film looks beautiful as it bounces between the immediacy of Edee in a cabin, and the vastness of the mountain vistas. Long-time cinematographer Bobby Bukowski (ARLINGTON ROAD, 1999) makes sure we experience the overwhelming beauty of nature (Alberta as a stand in for Wyoming), as well as its overwhelming danger. With minimal dialogue, much of the story is told through the nuanced physical acting from two pros, Ms. Wright and Mr. Bichir. Humor is injected through the use of Tears for Fears song, "Everybody Wants to Rule the World", and though it's kind of a running gag, the song's lyrics are spot on. There is no magic cure for disabling grief, but the dream of self-discovery by getting "one with nature" can be idealistic without proper guidance. As the film relays, the best path is more likely to be a fellow human being simply doing the right thing. Opens in theatres on February 12, 2021"

",""Everybody wants to rule the world" Sung along in Land, from Tears for Fears.Ethan Hawke brings in those lyrics as well in Tesla last year, making it an anthem for lonely souls seeking more control of their modern lives. Edee (Robin Wright, who also directs) encounters that song and sentiment during her self-exile in the Wyoming mountains in Land as she struggles with life and death in a failed attempt to control a narrative that includes the loss of her husband and son to a mass shooting.A week ago, I witnessed two other women against the odds with The World to Come, where smart ladies weather a brutal winter in 19th century Upper NY State and inadequate husbands. Both filmmakers have captured the reality of survival in hostile but beautiful surroundings, where the environment is metaphor for the storms within.Yet, like the hostile living, the women fight fate to control their lives, not without pain and suffering. Edee forsakes life only to find it stalking her in the form of a Good Samaritan, Miguel (Demien Bichir), who not only saves her life but gives her life through his generosity of heart for all living things.Edee must learn to survive (she has forsaken phones and cars) by killing animals and accepting humans, both challenges for a self-determined exile. The story is minimalist, needing not more than cinematographer Bobby Bukowski's stunning landscapes and Trevor Smith's production design, which is at home in the city as well as an old mountain cabin with previous haunting lives.Escape to stunning landscape? see Land, but don't think life can be left behind. Robin Wright's expert direction, for her first helming, never lets us forget that our humanity, and the need to connect with it, will never leave us.Land is a fascinating existential journey that showing the melancholy unity between the living and the dead, as James Joyce so poetically pointed out long ago. The connection that brings life: Miguel explains to Edee when she asks why he is helping her: "You were in my path."Be exhilarated by a story about exile that doesn't work. Land is beautiful, harrowing, and ultimately rewarding."

",""Land" is a Drama movie in which we watch a woman going to a cabin in Wyoming in order to live a different life than the one she was living in a city. She starts her new life there but she faces many difficulties since she is not used to this kind of life.I found this movie very interesting despite its simple and clich plot because the direction which was made by Robin Wright was simply beautiful. She introduced her main characters, their stories very well and she also used the beautiful landscape of Alberta which I found simply amazing and sometimes even breathtaking, equally good. The interpretations of both Robin Wright who played as Edee and Demin Bichir who played as Miguel were very good. In conclusion, I have to say that "Land" is a beautiful, emotional movie and I recommend everyone to watch it because I am sure that after watching it you will appreciate many things that you already have in your life and take them for granted."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10265034/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," Too Sparse To Kindle Much Emotion ","What initially drew me to a film like "Land" was how its trailer teased a story about an individual having trouble interacting with others (or in society-at-large) and thus striking out on a journey of self-discovery. While nominally that is exactly what "Land" is, it takes such a paint-by-numbers and emotionally sparse approach to the relevant themes that I never felt much investment in the proceedings.For a very basic overview, "Land" tells the story of Edee (Robin Wright), a woman fleeing the city for the wilderness after an apparent familial tragedy. After initially engaging in a woman-versus-nature struggle for survival, Edee eventually meets fellow outdoorsman Miguel (Demian Bichir), who might be the key to turning her little experiment around.For me, the problem with "Land" was pretty clear from the get-go: it was so emotionally sparse as to be almost withholding. Instead of hitting the emotional beats hard, director Wright just lets them roll by almost in documentary style. Viewers see Edee mourn a tragedy, struggle against the elements, and begin the process of societal re-integration (with Miguel), but it never quite feels like any of those threads are big/meaningful enough to truly care about as they are portrayed up on the big screen.Not helping matters is that whereas I expected a more psychological, inwardly focused tale, I found "Land" to be as much of a survivalist plot. While filled with great nature scenes and cinematography, that angle is one I've seen in film many times over. Instead of "Edee against the elements", I wanted "Edee against herself", and this film just doesn't play out in that format.Overall, "Land" isn't a horrible movie but any stretch of the imagination. It is just incredibly simple and sparse, leaving the viewer to fill in the blanks of almost all the emotional moments. If the exact story/events happen to move you more than me, or if the outdoors-y photography really grips you, you'll certainly give it more stars. But I was hoping for more internal emotion and ultimately was left disappointed in that regard."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10265034/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," An overly familiar lost soul drama ","You wouldn't call Robin Wright's feature directional debut (after helming a number of House of Cards episodes in its later seasons) a bad film in the typical sense of the label, but this overly familiar and utterly unsurprising tale of a lost soul learning too love life once again thanks too kindly strangers and the joys of the great outdoors does nothing to distinguish itself from a raft of other dramatic offerings in the same ilk that all managed to carve out more of a unique identity for themselves.Oddly enough bringing to mind Wright's ex-partner Sean Penn's Into the Wild, Land follows Wright's grieving widow Edee whose had enough of society and decides her best way forward is to remove herself from the human realm and get back to nature in the secluded Wyoming forest, only too quickly discover living off the land isn't the dream conjured up in text books while being close too other humans may in fact be exactly what she needs to heal from the grief of her past.The film looks beautiful thanks to its picturesque landscapes and as always Wright is a solid performer, even if Edee isn't exactly a unique character much like the narrative, but there's just not a lot that holds it all together here and whilst the film is brief at sub-90 minutes, there's a feeling of the same ground being covered throughout the film as Edee struggles with one thing after the other (bears, cold, no food) giving the film a repetitive nature that is only exaggerated when Demian Bichir's kindly Miguel arrives on the scene to reignite Edee's love for her fellow man and life in general.Sometimes comfort food is exactly what you need and that's clearly what Wright and her team were thinking when they designed Land to be consumed by eager cinemagoers and while you wish the best for Edee and eventually her friendship/potential relationship with Miguel, it doesn't make the film any more memorable or engaging with viewers likely to be hard pressed to remember or recall anything much of note in a film that's pleasant enough to put up with, without every threatening to be something that engages the heart, mind or spirit in the way in which it no doubt wanted too.Final Say -Land offers nothing more than familiar set-ups and experiences for viewers who would've undoubtedly seen many a lost soul seeks to find inner peace in the world movies beforehand, making Robin Wright's passion project an unnecessary and unmemorable drama.2 outdoor baths out of 5."

As the movie opens, Edee confesses to her shrink that "it's difficult to be around people", visibly in distress. Edee heads out west, and rents an abandoned cabin somewhere in Wyoming, throwing away her cell phone along the way. She is a city girl and not really prepared for what challenges are coming her way in the outdoors... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: after an illustrious acting career to date, Robin Wright finally takes the plunge and makes her directing debut (she also stars and produces). And what a debut it is! The movie is at its very best when Edee, the character played by Wright, is on her own trying to get things organized in her cabin. Hardly a word is spoken in that first half hour. Just Edee and whatever mother nature throws at her. Of course, the question that is on your mind is what exactly happened to Edee to drive her to the point where she cuts all contact with the outside world? (We don't get the full picture on this until almost the very end of the movie.) In the second half of the movie, Edee develops a bond with Miguel, a local hunter, which leads to some unexpected twists and turns as well. Along the way we get glorious photography of the outdoors (the movie is set in Wyoming, but really was filmed in Alberta, Canada). Check out also the beautiful original score, courtesy of Ben Sollee and Time For Three. Bottom line: Robin Wright's directing debut is a labor of love AND tour de force that I thoroughly enjoyed from start to finish, and one of the best movies of 2021 I've seen so far."Land" premiered at this year's Sundance film festival a few weeks ago, and opened this weekend in theaters. I couldn't wait to see it. The Sunday early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended okay: 7 people in total, which seems to be par for the course these days as COVID-19 continues to rage through the country (most of the movies I've seen typically get between 5 and 10 people). I honestly don't know how theaters can operate profitably under these circumstances... Anyway, if you have an interest in seeing a deeply human outdoor survival drama or simply are a fan of Robin Wright, I'd readily suggest you check this out and draw your own conclusion."

Robin suffers a personal tragedy and Kim-her sister-fears that Robin might have suicidal tendencies. Robin decides to get away from everyone and moves up into the remote mountains of Wyoming and buys a deserted cabin-the previous owner left in a hurry so she got it cheap. She has no outdoor experience-hunting, fishing, etc,-but she doesn't want to be around anyone, and clearly, doesn't think it through. When she runs out of food and is about to loose her sanity, Demian comes across her and helps her get back on her feet. He teaches her how to survive-hunting, fishing, etc.-and they both benefit from the other person's company, whether they realize it or not. Demian has secrets, too, in this symbiotic relationship.

","Robin Wright is front & center (in her directorial debut) in this recent release about a woman who decides to chuck civilization behind & live in a remote cabin. Seen in choppy flashbacks, we glean Wright has undergone some tragedy as her (as we'll learn) sister-in-law, played by Kim Dickens, implores her to rethink her decision. Obviously Wright follows through w/her choice as we see her buying provisions for a long stay (nay indefinite!) & when she reaches the cabin, she informs the seller she'll pay to have someone to come pick up & return her U Haul gear which leaves him nonplussed as she retreats into her new home. Time passes & she tries to follow a manual for living off the land (planting crops & hunting becomes a real chore) & after an out house run she gets an unwelcome visit from a bear who cleans her out of her canned goods which puts her in quite a precarious position. Nearing death, a savior shows up (along w/his friend a nurse), played by Oscar nominee Demian Bichir, who saves her, staying by her side (or at least camping out in his car) until she gets well. A tenuous relationship develops (he knows something is obviously up w/her life but he doesn't push) & she learns what she needs to survive & even during a period where he knows he'll be away, Bichir leaves his dog w/her. Will this small act of kindness bring Wright out of her shell? Wright may've been influenced by her ex's, Sean Penn's Into the Wild (a man gives up the city life to live out in the wilds) by tackling this story but she's up to the task providing a great role (w/minimum dialogue) which walks the walk. Bichir is delightfully supportive as the man biding his time for Wright to come into her own & when the reveal comes of why Wright has chosen the beaten path, it enhances her resolve & at film's end makes where she is more poignant. Also starring Warren Christie (from the great short lived Syfy series Alphas) as Wright's husband."

You as a viewer should "choose" to see Land. It's a somewhat enthralling vehicle that again pits human vs nature.Land's setting is inclement weathered Wyoming (which masquerades as Alberta, Canada). And it's another film in which the power of scenic beauty can still test your icy lifeblood. As something about a depressed woman who flees the outside world to live in a stodgy log cabin, Land is one of those few flicks in which you want the running time to be about twenty minutes longer. At just under an hour and a half, Land at times gives the moviegoer the feeling of being in an effective, dream-like state. Other times the pic appears a little pat and almost underwhelming.So yeah, Land features star and first-time director, Robin Wright. Along with giving a solid, nerve-ending performance, Wright also has a keen eye behind the camera. From an acting standpoint, Robin gets her veritable, All Is Lost moment (except that she has more dialogue than golden boy Robert Redford). From a directorial standpoint, Wright is a visual auteur and sort of Terrence Malick-esque. With every zoom, every quiet jiff, every tree branch, every furry animal, every snowflake, and every distanced mountain, it's like the Western Canadian sweep in Land should be framed in a portrait.In cessation, Land does have a few tense moments where you see the Wright character trying to force herself into dealing with arid isolation. And the movie for the most part, appears widescreen ready. Still, Land ends on a slight whim as a twist is added involving a hunter who saves Edee's life. Overall, the film is just missing something extra, a better dare to be moment of choice perhaps. Safe and zippy "landing"."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10265034/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Emotional and Visually Compelling, but slow paced ","The upcoming dramatic film LAND, by Robin Wright is intriguing, valiant and relatable. I found it astounding that Robin Wright not only directed but stars in this film as the principal figure Edee. You may be familiar with Wright's work on House of Cards as she directed many fan favorite episodes. Considering this is Robin Wright's feature film directorial debut, she surpassed any expectations I had for this film. This film shows the raw emotion of a human overcome by grief.The storyline follows Edee (Robin Wright) as she is managing with unimaginable despondency after the passing of her spouse and child. Edee makes a bold choice to depart from society, seeking out a new life off the grid in Wyoming. In preparation for that, she tosses her phone, buys a bunch of canned supplies, and buys an isolated, somewhat rundown cabin, in the Wyoming wild. Throughout the film, you see how isolated she feels once she starts her new life; it's like she left her old self behind along with society.Edee is certain about her brave decision, and ready to start a new life. However, there is no anticipating for the area's unforgiveable winter. She is incapable of keeping the fire going to warm her cabin. After a bear continually eats her food, Edee is on the brink of starvation, as well as frail and too cold to stand. She is saved by a neighborly hunter and woodsman Miguel (Demin Bichir), who brings her back to life and teaches her how to survive living off the land. As Edee starts to construct a new life for herself outside of civilization, she works on dealing with her grief and looking toward a bright future.My favorite part in Land is when Edee is fishing at a nearby lake. As she struggles to catch a fish, she becomes frustrated. Then, she notices Miguel chasing his young son, Drew (Finlay Wojtak-Hissong). She recalls memories of her late spouse and child. Her eyes follow them as they run through the trees. I enjoyed watching as she recalls those precious moments from her past; it is a heartfelt moment in this film.However, although this film is only 88 minutes long, it feels way longer than that, due to its slow pace. Many scenes are dragged out and many just feel "dry." There are certainly many relatable moments in the film, but they don't make up for the slow pace.This film definitely tugs at your heart, promotes positive behaviors and shows the true meaning of kindness. What I took away from this film is that it is okay to be not okay. Sometimes, we need a break from our continuous schedule in life to break free!I give Land 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 11 to 18, plus adults. It debuts Feb. 12, 2021 in theaters.

","If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Who doesn't appreciate Robin Wright's career as an actress? Every time I see her name attached to a film, I can't help but feel excited about it. So, obviously, any movie with her would be one of my most anticipated films of Sundance. However, the main reason why I was highly expecting Land wasn't due to her acting credit, but because this is her feature directorial debut. Her performance didn't disappoint me, though, much on the contrary. Wright continues to prove her talent time and time again, delivering an incredibly captivating interpretation of a character who demonstrates that perseverance and the will to live can work as a healing method in the worst of times. An extraordinary character-study written by Jesse Chatham and Erin Dignam.However, it's her role as the director that surprises me the most. Her vision is clearly depicted through sumptuous cinematography (Bobby Bukowski) and an original score (Ben Sollee, Time For Three) that becomes part of the narrative. In fact, I dare write that without its music, Land would lack that special element to elevate everything as a whole. Well, to be fair, the Rockies hold landscapes so jaw-dropping and awe-inspiring that I would sincerely enjoy just staring at this movie for its sceneries.It's one of the best-looking films I've seen in the last few years, and that's a key component because story-wise, there isn't much action or impactful events going - except for the last couple of revelatory minutes - which might become tiresome for some viewers. It's a bit odd how usually, I don't see great replay value in this type of movies, but I genuinely want to revisit this one for its visuals and score. I can't end this review without praising Demin Bichir, who offers a performance as remarkable as Wright's. Absolutely phenomenal.Land is an outstanding feature directorial debut from Robin Wright, who also delivers one of my favorite performances of hers. An incredibly inspirational film that relies on its unforgettable visuals and an extremely engaging score to present me with one of my favorite movies of this year's Sundance. Without the shadow of a doubt, it's one of the most gorgeously shot films I've seen in quite a long time. Every single scene is filled with an awe-inspiring landscape in the background that took me to the beautiful snowy mountains in such an emotional manner. Thank you, Bobby Bukowski, for your jaw-dropping cinematography, but it's Ben Sollee and Time For Three's score that elevate the overall picture in a way that without their music, the storytelling would suffer tremendously. Demin Bichir also deserves as much praise as Wright when it comes to their acting displays. Jesse Chatham and Erin Dignam's screenplay isn't groundbreaking, but Land breaks my personal tendency of feeling that this type of movie lacks replay value. I'll rewatch this sooner or later, and I recommend everyone to do the same.Rating: A-"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10265034/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Great directional debut for Robin Wright ","A beautiful film. Kind of a similar storyline as "Nomadland" but with a different approach and lower budget. But what director Robin Wright did with that limited budget for her directional debut is simply beautiful. Its a very emotional film that leads you to several unexpected roads and turns. Robin Wright also plays the leading role and gives one of her best performances of all times. First half of the film shows a woman facing the new challenge of isolation and the second part is kind of a redemption. In both ways Wright is fabulous. Besides her we have Damian Bichir. He is simply wonderful. His character is so beautifully written and he plays it in such a tender, natural way that you can't help but just love him. Its truly one of the best and most underrated performances of the year that clearly deserved award attention. Bichir builds that role up so well and plays it so warmly its really great. A great and unexpected turn in a film I thought was going to be a one-woman-show mainly. Besides the quality of the two performances we also get to hear a lovely score and see amazing pictures thanks to a great cinematography that perfectly knows how to put the scenery in place. Screenplay was good and so was the direction. Really a good film that deserves to be seen."

The dead persons sin returns from the city and story unfolds as he remembers his father's mischiefs. Story proceeds by shifting between the past and present, with light comedy. Slowly the lady love enters the plot and there is a twist in the present and also the past stories and the suspense element adds up.Acting of all the characters are very much natural without stressing the fact that it is a comedy. BGM kept to the minimum, only the screenplay and acting is made to take up the front seat.Since I'm not a Tamilian, I'm not sure if the actors have acted in any other movies, but they are very natural. The feather son duo excels.Anyhow, few scenes seems to be out of place, but they are important to the story. For example, the father is shown as tricking people and even his kids for his profit, but the scene showing good side of him doesn't got enough intensity."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10280296/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Gripping story very well told. ","It is interesting to watch this film now, in a week where a British MP has been brutally stabbed to death doing his job, and to maybe ask ourselves a question. What has the killing of a man ever actually achieved? It never makes anything any better. It serves to galvanise both sides and retrench enmities and bitterness that can take many years to wain. This film depicts one such story. That of a man who also passionately believed it was acceptable to take a life. His motives appear demonstrably justifiable as we watch this beautifully shot, frequently harrowing, depiction of the lead up to the atrocity of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre in 1919. It is told through the eyes of the assassin - Udham Singh (Vicky Kaushal) and over the course of the next two hours, we are exposed to the events that drove a decent man to commit the ultimate sin, and to pay the ultimate penalty. Whilst it does take a little while to get going, Shoojit Sircar develops a story replete with conflicting emotions, that offers a critique on the prevailing imperial attitudes and on the very value of life itself. It clearly, and succinctly, exemplifies the cruelty visited on people who just wanted to be left to govern themselves; and of the shockingly arrogant superiority complex of those who believed these people to be little more capable of such aspirations than pets, or sheep. The film looks stunning - the imagery of India from grand scale to violent aftermath; the settings in London - all add hugely to the gusty integrity of this story. As with so much about the man himself, much is still be be made public about these events and about the true intent of the vice-regal, or British, government in making an example of these unarmed protesters - but this surmising offers an entirely plausible assessment of man's inhumanity to man - and sadly, over 100 years on from this - we appear to have learned little about the merits of killing another human being - friend or foe."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10280296/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Yes, bollywood can make a patriotic film far away from dramatic jigoism like Hollywood Classics Patton and Schindler's List and Sardar Udham is our first impactful attempt. ","Sardar Udham (2021) : Movie Review -I am not gonna write a regular review for this one which combines things like acting, writing, screenplay, music and direction because i don't really think this is a film made to glorify that hardcore patriotism from India's history. Making a commercial jiongism patterns like 'Border' (1997), 'Uri' (2019), and 'Shershaah' (2021) is easy and safe because you that our massy audience will fall for patriotic emotions and will forgive cinematic mistakes. But making a relevant and thought-provoking film like 'Haqeeqat' is still a dream for new generation filmmakers. Sardar Udham is high-end triggering drama with strong flavour of Shoojit Sircar style. Those who are expecting a quality cinema and are ready to wait for a while are welcome and those who want to whistle and scream during mass sequences are prohibited from viewing this movie. Sardar Udham is typical Shoojit Sircar style slow burn but moreover it attempts to rediscover patriotic biographical genre in Indian Cinema on the level of what Hollywood did with film like 'Patton' (1970) and 'Schindler's List' (1993).Jalianwala Bagh massacre is one of the most brutal events ever happened in the 20th century in any corner of the world. But how many times it has made you feel that pain even today except for Anniversary trends on social media and few glimpses in any freedom fighter's biopic in Indian Cinema? We have seen this particular event in many biopics from Bhagat Singh to Gandhi to Sardar Patel and few more but Sardar Udham is probably the only film which has made a big issue out of it to create an entire plot affected by that terrible masscare. I remember watching Soviet Filmmaker Sergei Eisenstein's film which showed one of that Russian Massacre in Brutal manners and who on earth knew that those scenes from a silent film made in 1920s decade would remain the most astonishing massacre scenes in cinema history. Sardar Udham might just become that for Bollywood Cinema. Especially those last 40 minutes where you feel the pain of Udham, a teenager, who didn't really understand what just happened and it kept him torturing for 2 decades. Finally, he took the revenge and yet it feels like a soft punishment because you hate British empire so much that even shooting a man dead in front of 50 people feels so less. British had killed hundreds brutally in Jalianwala Bagh massacre and any toughest punishment in the world can't justify that. Sardar Udham is about this ideology, not a revenge. There are thousands of revenge in the history of India but not all them became universal ideologies.One of the best thing i noticed in Sardar Udham is it shows that fatal state of mind British government during world war 2. You see, World War 2 is one of the major reason behind India's independence but our historians and filmmakers have always overlooked this fact. You gotta know that British saw it coming back what they did to India. In this movie there is a quote to explain this- "Germany calling. The sun finally seems to setting at British Empire. Like an elephant, Indians never forget their enemies" and the next two scenes when Udham Singh questions the Law twice, once in Courtroom before Judge and once during investigation in front of detective. Do you remember any Bollywood Film going in such details about ideology and morals? Leave that topic for further arguments later.So, overall Sardar Udham is quite a break from commercial potboilers and there are many reasons to make it a Must See in your watchlist as a true quality cinema lover. However, couple of flaws needs to be bashed equally as i praised good things. The film starts very slow, it looks scattered and irrelevant sometimes but maybe that's because the story of Udham never has enough documents and events available in public domain. I won't say much about acting and other aspects as said in the beginning but for Vicky Kaushal I say one thing that he has completely surrendered himself to director's uncompromised vision. I won't be surprised to see him taking a bunch of trophies home after the award ceremonies next year. Shoojit Sir, you have attempted something revolutionary and respect you for that. Nevertheless, i still say it could have been little better or a certain Classic. It misses that Mark by few inches though. Rest, highly recommended. A deserving tribute to underdog Udham Singh and his Friend, Brother and Idol 'Shaheed Bhagat Singh'.RATING - 7.5/10*"

","Sardar Udham review :Of all the movies Shoojit Sircar has made till date, this has to be the most technically brilliant one. Capturing the landscape from Amristar to London, the shots appear like a beautiful painting on celluloid. The art design, recreating the 1930s and early '40s when most of this film is based, is top class. Sardar Udham is also the most unconventional historical movie made in Indian cinema. If you are looking for entertainment or patriotic jingoism here, sorry but this is just not the movie for you!!Indeed, Sardar Udham is a highly realistic and at times, harrowing depiction of the relatively unknown freedom fighter who decides to avenge the Jallianwala Baug massacre. Travelling all the way to London to execute the two officials responsible for the most inhuman act in British India, Udham Singh takes a long time to execute his plan. But he is successful at the end.Narrated non-linearly, the film may get tad difficult for the aam junta not used to such treatment as well as those who are not so well versed with the historical events of that period specially those second world war references and the communists' role in it. Udham Singh's torture scenes in British jail are also extremely discomforting to watch.Vicky Kaushal, in the titular role, delivers his career best performance. This one deserves a National award, no less!! Kirsty Averton as Eileen Palmer, Udham's sympathizer from the local Communist party, is a standout. The other firangi actors are earnest and thankfully, talk in English instead of that oh-so-familiar accented Hindi patented by Bob Christo.Sardar Udham reaches its pinnacle in the last forty minutes dedicated to the Jallianwala Baug tragedy. I have read and seen this event many times before but trust me, was never ever shaken so much!! It is a heart wrenching watch sure to move you to tears.Finally, films like Sardar Udham need to be made and the sacrifice of these great freedom fighters deserve much more attention than just a footnote accorded to them in our school history books.Regards, Sumeet Nadkarni."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10280296/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," Masterpiece ","Review By Kamal KSardar Udham is a biopic based on the namesake revolutionary. The movie tracks his journey as a youngster to the rebel he finally becomes.The narrative can be broadly categorised into three segments, although there is no differentiation from the makers. The first half an hour is the execution. It shows the struggle of Udham Singh to reach London and then proceeds to the fateful day of the assassination.That's when the second segment begins. It is the lengthiest one, focusing on how Udham Singh achieved what he set out to do. It deals with the recce work of Udham and what he did he do over the years until the fateful day.And the third segment deals with the reason for the change of heart in a young Udham Singh. Shoojit Sircar depicts the most gruesome portrayal of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre in the final half an hour.Vicky Kaushal is the heart and soul of Sardar Udham. He has given it all to the role, which offers him ample scope to show his dramatic skills. The pain in his eyes is palpable when he recollects the injustice meted out to Indian's in India by the British. Similarly, anger and aggression are naturally portrayed.The background score by Shantanu Moitra is decent. The cinematography by Avik Mukhopadhyay is brilliant. The pre-Independence era is exquisitely captured and recreated along with the help of the art department.The film, at 2 hours and 42 minutes will require a patient watch. But I promise you, the experience is well worth it. Recommended!"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10280296/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Shoojit Sircar, Take a bow! ",""Revolution is an inalienable right of mankind. Freedom is an imperishable birthright of all" - Bhagat SinghWow! What an incredible piece of Cinema I have just been a witness of! I'm truly captivated by Sircar's direction and the way he addressed such a heroic act of patriotism. And I can't convey enough appreciation for representing such a fairly unknown story of the Martyr, Udham Singh; who against all the odds made the impossible. He shook the British empire to its core and sent out a decisive statement against their heinous colonialism.From a technical stance alone, I must admit, this was something very special! I had never seen a historical drama on such an enormous scale before. From the detailed set designs to the astounding Cinematography, the commendable art direction to the world-building; it has every right to be considered as a landmark in Indian filmography. Trust me, supervising any sets with that many people and intricacies; it's easier said than done. And this gets even more fascinating when you consider the restricted expenditures!Likewise, the performances leave quite an impression. Amongst the entire cast, Vicky Kaushal's act indisputably draws our attention the most. Particularly, towards the end. Where, in my opinion; he gives his absolute best. Speaking of the rest of the ensemble, I was amazed to observe such a capable group of foreign nationals playing their roles with utmost affection and integrity!My only criticisms are in regards to the comparatively long-winded screenplay and its Non-linear structure. Don't get me wrong, I'm all up for Non-linear storytelling, but I'm not sure whether it was an absolute necessity in this case.Even though I gotta say, that whole Jallianwala Bagh massacre sequence is no less than a cinematic brilliance. No matter, how tough you deem yourself to be, remember the words; it's gonna break your heart. If it was up to me, I would have probably inaugurated the film with this portion rather than placing it near the climax. That way, I guess the impact would have been far greater.Lastly, I just wanna thank all the people who have contributed to such an ambitious endeavour and I wanna give my regards to Mr Shoojit Sircar as he's done plentiful to denote the atrocities of British Imperialism. Innumerable manslaughters, abscondings, tortures; the British without any question, shares a dark & sinful past with our country and its people.My heartiest admiration goes to all the martyrs and their families who sacrificed everything just to break the shackles and to get our much-awaited Sovereignty & Freedom. And most importantly they did all that while being unified, irrespective of class, religion or Identity.Today's generation should learn a thing or two!"

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10280296/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," Perfect is not just a word for Sardar Udham ","Shoojit Sircar showed us once again how a biopic should be made, and the level of Sardar Udham waa extraordinary. Vicky Kaushal is a rising star and his role of Sardar Udham showed us why he is a great contender for Bollywood's future.A dark tale of an individual, fighting for the freedom of the nation, in a different way, in a different nation is enthralling and at the same time, emotional and captivating as well. With a brilliant cinematography and strong dialogues added with terrific acting, Sardar Udham can be claimed as one of the best biopic on a freedom fighter that has ever been made.Hats off to the team of Sardar Udham, Shoojit Sircar, Vicky Kaushal and the entire cast that brought out such an outstanding example of Indian cinema with a compelling story about the struggles we had for the freedom of our nation. This is truly a remarkable on an international level and an oscar nomination worthy movie.My Rating : 10/10."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10280296/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Vicky Kaushal's monumental performance does justice to the tale of a legendary freedom fighter! ","Shoojit Sircar delivers yet another nuanced, offbeat yet impactful cinema experience after Vicky Donor (2012), Madras Cafe (2013) and Piku (2015) in Udham Singh, riding on an immense performance from Vicky Kaushal.The biopic tells us the relatively unknown tale of Shaheed-i-Azam ('greatest of martyrs') Sardar Udham Singh, who gunned down one of the perpetrators of the Jalianwala Bagh massacre, Michael O'Dwyer, audaciously in the center of London.A harrowing character portrayal of a man scarred by the massacre of his people, Vicky Kaushal delves deep into the anguish, the motivations and the resolve of the legendary freedom fighter, portraying each stage of his life with dignified conviction.A story that would be unbelievable if it were not true, the film shows us the steely determination of a freedom fighter hell bent on revenge, who embarks on a perilous journey through Afghanistan and USSR to strike at his enemy's heart in London.The film never meanders to jingoistic levels instead quietly yet profoundly putting across the messages of freedom and equality propagated by Udham and a fantastic Amol Parashar who essays the role of Shaheed Bhagat Singh.Director Sircar has taken an unconventional non-linear narrative style, a format rarely used in nationalistic films. He leverages it to astutely put across not just the freedom fighter's perspectives but that also of the British administration.While the British officers are often portrayed as evil, maniacal tropes in most freedom fighter movies, Sircar again refuses to follow the norm. Shaun Scott is terrific as the banal, even dispassionate Michael O'Dwyer while Stephen Hogan is impactful as the detective charged with extracting Udham's confession.Sardar Udham is a firm reminder that our country's freedom was won by a group of men and women who were made of sterner stuff, who sacrificed everything for their motherland.The film, at 2 hours and 42 minutes will require a patient watch. But I promise you, the experience is well worth it. Recommended!"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10280296/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Don't fall for the negative reviews ","I watched this movie on Prime and would say, it was worth an effort from director, creators and of course, actors.It's slow burn but never fall short of the subject matter or the descriptions. Every character is given ample amount of time, every scene is elaborated and the whole focus remains upon the subject. The creators have played the dice to showcase the actual events in reverse order, however, keeping in mind that no sequence remains unsitched.Moreover, I liked the depection of the first part of the 20th century, that is the locations, costumes, habits etc.Saying so, yaa, I did feel that in some places, it could have been a bit fast in pace and skipped a few incidents so as to reduce the time from 2 hrs 45 mins to like 2 hrs and 20 mins here and there. And that's where I would cut 2 points. But, a very good film and definitely watchable. Keep your patience and time with you, and you won't regret it."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10280296/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," Vicky Kaushal's Sardar Udham Is A Ticking Time Bomb Waiting To Explode !!! ","The film pays tribute to an unsung hero - Sardar Udham Singh (Vicky Kaushal), an Indian revolutionary, who assassinated Michael O'Dwyer in London (in 1940), to avenge the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre (of 1919). The former British colonial official was the Lieutenant Governor of Punjab (British India) at the time. Dwyer had said the killing of hundreds of protesters during a demonstration at Jallianwala Bagh in the city of Amritsar, Punjab, was justified.First things first - If you are looking for a talky film that can light the revolutionary fire in you, 'Sardar Udham' isn't it. Do not expect hard-hitting dialoguebaazi or emotional outbursts. The pre-independence drama based on true events, is a simmering observation of a man consumed by grief. The protagonist makes numbing pain his strength and silence, his voice. Loss and despair are so overpowering that avenging the barbaric crime he witnessed in his 20's, becomes the only reason for his existence, even 20 years later.Set at the onset of World War II, the film shuttles between past and present. The canvas is massive but meaty source material on the titular character, meagre. None of Udham Singh's chest-thumping slogans or writings (if any) was found. Here was a man, deeply scarred, who went about doing his job quietly. The challenge was to then connect the dots with whatever little information available and get into his psyche. Shoojit Sircar tries to decode the 'why' and not just how he ended up doing what he did. The aim is to understand the emotional arc of an innocent boy from Amristar who wouldn't hold a gun, let alone firing one. What led him to fire at Dwyer from point-blank range and not flee the spot? Was it driven by revenge? Why harbour the pain for two decades and not move on for good? Why is the same person a revolutionary and terrorist for different people?Shoojit SIrcar doesn't take a myopic look at heroism or freedom. His hero doesn't seem invincible or hero-like. Udham Singh didn't hate a man or his country who spurred the massacre. His fight was against the British ideology of conquering others' right to speak and live freely. Through an exhausting runtime of 2 Hr 42 Mins, Shoojit makes us meet Udham, a stoical man on a mission. He moves like a shadow, relentless in his pursuit of Dwyer and freedom from the oppressive British rule. For the longest time, we solely become a spectator of his painstaking journey. We don't feel invested enough. We see him landing odd jobs in London and being the centre of various unremarkable events leading up to the assassination.As much as we anticipate the volcano of his past to erupt eventually, the road to that heart-wrenching climax is tedious. Underplaying is an effective tool as long as it doesn't underwhelm. This film is a ticking time bomb waiting to explode but beware; the wait tries your patience. The intention is to give a lull before the storm treatment to storytelling. Silence is amplified so when Udham's inner turmoil finds an outlet, the impact reaches a crescendo. It's cleverly thought out but the execution yields mixed results. The non-linear, non-verbose narrative struggles to hold your attention even an hour into the movie. The re-enactment of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre is unsettling to watch and that is the very reason why this story needed to be told.Vicky Kaushal as Sardar Udham dips his toes into uncharted waters. He tries his best to get unspoken words across but a film like this needed an Irrfan to speak through his eyes. You can trust a seasoned actor to elevate portions that demand stillness. Vicky is remarkable in certain scenes though. A drunk scene in particular, his 20 something portrayal and his climactic conversation with a British investigator extract the best out of him as an actor. Him wondering, "Mere jawani ka koi matlab bana?" is heart-breaking. The writing tries to avoid clichs but ends up sounding contemporary instead. Bhagat Singh's Hinglish dialogues like, "Hum sirf exploitation ke against hai. Humein semi-independence nahi chahiye," sound out of place given the setting. The line that stays with you is Udham reminiscing his turbulent past and asking a British officer, "What were you doing when you were 23?"Sardar Udham's courage never roared. It whispered.

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10280296/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," An addition to the patriotic movies of India ","Shoojit Sircar always stunned us with his beautiful works like Vicky Donor, Madras Cafe, Piku, October, and now he came back with his new one Sardar Udham, a biopic about revolutionary Udham Singh. We all witnessed many films regarding the freedom struggle in India, Sardar Udham also shows the freedom struggles and the colonized vision of the British empire. We can note the storyline in one word because this is the story of revenge. It invites us into 1919; the Jallianwala Bagh massacre and Udham Singh's journey to assassin the man behind the massacre, Micheal O'dwyer. The film goes in a non-linear pattern where we are seeing Udham in his fourties and then straight him as a teenager. He planned to kill Dwyer, worked as his assistant but waited for 21 years to take his revenge. This is quite a strange thing because we all have that question, why doesn't he kill him early? The answer is that he wants to take his revenge in public because Dwyer has also done the same. I can remember the face of Udham Singh while he come out from the Caxton Hall when he took his revenge. He doesn't feel any kind of guilty even he smiles when he accompanies the policemen. That was the most memorable moment in the film. The last part of the film is also brilliant where Sircar shows the activities that happened at Jallianwala Bagh. It was so intense, so violent and I hesitate to open my eyes for that 30 minutes long 'massacre scene'. It was so disturbing one. There lies the true intention of Udham Singh to take his revenge. All the technical aspects of the film are top-notch. The length of the film seems a little long even the director can short some 15-20 minutes without affecting the film. Anyway I'm not using this platform for the negatives I like the film very much and it is watchable."

I was on the verge of turning it off unable to take it any more but out of respect, somehow kept going. Never ever has Jallianwala Baug massacre portrayed this way in history of cinema. This is however the most important film to come out in recent times.Yes this is about Sardar Udham Sign but it is also about millions of Indians who sacrificed themselves for the freedom we enjoy in modern India and take it for granted. It is very intelligently written, the production design is on a level Bollywood hasn't seen in a long long time. The sound design and background score is skillfully done and the editing is just how I like it. Shoojit Sircar has obviously worked with DoP to capture every frame masterfully. Technically this is near perfect.I would've given minus stars but didn't have heart to give it to the marketing department, producers and distributors. This movie should be screened in all the film festivals and has potential to be India's oscar entry for this year. Wake up people.Finally, I just want to say this movie should also be in British high school curriculum. Of course, it's wishful thinking."

It's slow but to get the emotions etc. You have to cover each and every aspect in details.There are many such freedom fighters who sacrificeses are not known."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10280296/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," A little long and slow, but still first rate ","Biopics on political revolutionaries of pre partition struggle are not many, and such movies are welcome. Since the canvas of such stories is wide, there may be many subplots and there is comparatively more explaining to do. Additionally there is hardly any scope to include romance, dance, comedy, action, melodrama etc and therefore there is a tendency by the director to end up making a documentary even though it is unintended. Such films invariably have a running time in excess of two and a half hours. A feature film has necessarily to be in a two hour format and entertaining for common audiences. There is therefore a challenge to the director of the movie of this genre.After seeing this film, it is clear that Shoojit Sarkar and Vicky Kaushal are both world class. Both have been doing very well so far in any case. The film is a gripping depiction of the incidents of that period and the locales of Afghanistan, Russia and England are authentically shown. The film is a triumph for the director and his crew for capturing the atmosphere of that time so admirably . The claustrophobic prison cells, the London streets, the factories, the people all ring true. The extended scene of Jallianwala bagh massacre has been shot and presented superbly. The moments after the firing with hundreds killed and injured is poignant, sorrowful and has heart wrenching visuals. Chilling no doubt, it will stay with you long after the movie .The four main characters Uddham, the investigating inspector , Michael O'Dwyer, and Reginald Dyer are depicted realistically all expressing their individualistic points of view.Direction is top class and Vicky Kaushal gets an opportunity to put up a superb performance. There is some memorable top class dialogue spoken both by the British officers and revolutionary Udham.The negative point of the movie is the running time over two and a half hours due to which the film drags at places. It is too long and too slow. The film could easily be reduced by 30 minutes and this must be done if it gets selected for Oscar awards.Some trivia as per the film. Did you know that Udham had a weakness for laddoos ( Indian sweet), he had a girlfriend who was dumb, he took alcohol and got high at times and he took oath on the book " Heer Ranjha" in court?"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10280296/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," Sardar Udham- The Untold Saga of a Forgotten Patriot ","Sardar Udham, the latest offering from the ace director Shoojit Sircar is a heart wrenching tale of the sacrifices of one of the forgotten heroes of our freedom struggle- Sardar Udham Singh. It is a poignant saga of a martyr seldom remembered for his valor, determination or devotion to his motherland. India's inability to make biopics sans unnecessary emotions or well researched set pieces is well known. But Sardar Udham breaks the barrier and presents before us a creation that should be hailed for its dogged determination in denying the norms and for depicting a story which needed extensive study, unbiased sentiments and unabashed truthfulness.The cardinal parts of the protagonist's life from during the repercussions of the Jalliwanwala Bag massacre to his eventual execution in the hands of the British imperialists form the core of the story. The nucleus of course is the vengeance he took on the soil of the Britishers. Throughout the journey, we are presented with so many facts hitherto unknown to the most. In an age of History courses taught through FB or WhatsApp posts, director Shoojit Sircar takes a U-turn and works on several important issues deliberately untold before. It takes tremendous courage to portray the political orientation of Sardar Udham or his friend-cum-brother-cum-political mentor Bhagat Singh. The political ideology of HSRA has been depicted without any penchant for being partisan to gain any political mileage for the movie, a common trait these days. Another aspect of the movie is its bravery to show how Indians irrespective of their religions were used to suppress their own fellows during those tumultuous days. Keeping the dialogues mostly in English or Punjabi instead of ludicrously pronounced Hindi by the Britishers adds to the genuineness of intentions of the creator.The film, however, has its own share of flaws. The makeup is not classy and looks artificial at times. The lad who donned the role of Bhagat Singh does not look convincing. The undulating movements of the time frames become monotonous at certain points. Certain unnecessary flashbacks could have been avoided. The runtime of more than 160 minutes is a bit irksome and at least thirty minutes could have been trimmed to maintain the tempo. The climax does not yield enough dividends for the patience held for so long.If we can ignore the minor flaws, Sardar Udham has the potentials to become a classic in the coming years. Vicky Kaushal as the vengeful protagonist is a treat to watch. In a metaphorical scene at the Freedom of Speech squad, he delivers a monologue that knocks you down for his sheer timing and brilliant expressions. Did the director take a dig at something at that scene? Vicky is terrific throughout and he is one reason you should not miss this movie. Stephen Hogan as the detective inspector John Swain is smooth in essaying a tough role that demanded dutifulness and softness. Amol Parashar as Bhagat Singh as already mentioned lacks the confidence. Shaun Scott as Michael O'dwyer is believable and Kirsty Averton as Eileen is expressive.The movie has the ideological presence of the great martyr Bhagat Singh throughout and that maybe a good lesson for many who idolize him without having any respect for the ideals he promoted. The massacre scene of Jalliwanwala Bagh is gruesome, horrific and presents the true magnitude of violence inflicted by the Britishers on our countrymen during those days. The scene is long, raw and uncompromising, a train not common in our movie industry where nothing is done without glamorizing. Sardar Udham does not for a moment try to add any glamour to a story which needed truthfulness, honesty and a heart clear of any partisan feelings.Watch this movie if you want to revisit those days. Watch this movie if you consider yourself non-judgmental. Watch this for the man who needs to be championed for his sheer patriotism, unabated spirit of equality and unhindered love for his countrymen.My rating- 9 out of 10."

","When Bollywood makes biopics, they tend to follow that one route --> start from childhood, show him/her rise and then show the events that follow. Shoojit Sircar is different and so are his films including SARDAR UDHAM.This film begins on a different note. It starts from mid way of Udham's life and moves forward from there and what follows is all events being slowly unraveled through investigations and through udham singh's confessions. It takes a different non linear way of presenting the events rather than the stereotypical cliche bollywood style.YES IT IS SLOW BUT YOU DONT HAVE THE AUDACITY TO COMPLAIN! If you are new to watching Shoojit's films dare not complain instead go watch his previous works first but if you are a follower of his films, you wont complain as you know you are well prepared for a film of this pace.Set designs --> havent seen such in Bollywood ever. Straight out of a Hollywood production house it seems like. Brilliant! Vicky Kaushal doesnt really have too many dialogues he's almost like a silent killer. His emotions his eyes do the talking.At 2hr 40 mins, the level of detailing is phenomenal. Making a film with lots of trivia detailing like the radio talking about Irish revolution, WW2 etc is very difficult considering your main topic is different but it sets up the mood right and makes sure you feel you are in the 1930s. Some details about Bhagat Singh's movement are there too.Undoubtedly the most haunting part comes in the last 1 hour. Brace yourselves for the long sequence that comes in the last 1 hour.Vicky as i talked has done a good job! Amol Parashar as Bhagat Singh is okayish we have seen better portrayals in other films dedicated to him completely . Banita Sandhu is only in a cameo in a forced love angle that the film could have avoided or i really dont know if it was true.AN UNMISSABLE FILM!"

Phil calls her the "suicide widow". Peter (Kodi Smit-McPhee) is her awkward son.This is a Jane Campion film. It's a slow burn especially in the first half. While I find these characters compelling, I do wish to have more reasons for these characters. I need their history. I do wonder if I missed something in the movie or if the book gives more meat to the bone. It's a movie of quiet beauty and an emotional volcano underneath the surface.

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10293406/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," Possibly the best film of the year. ","I hope the uncalled for comparisons with "Heaven's Gate" and, for that matter, "Brokeback Mountain" don't hurt the chances of "The Power of the Dog" doing well, either at the box-office or come awards season. This is Jane Campion's first feature film since "Bright Star" twelve years ago and it may be a masterpiece. It's a 'contemporary' western in that it's set in 1925 and is about two brothers, both ranchers, one 'good', (Jesse Plemons), and one 'bad', (Benedict Cumberbatch), and what happens when Plemons brings home a new wife, (Kirsten Dunst), and her teenage son, (Kodi Smit-McPhee).It's a slow, visually stunning, (Ari Wegner is the DoP), character-driven piece written by Campion from Thomas Savage's novel and it deals with both the themes of revenge and redemption. Cumberbatch may appear to be the conventional villain but it's clear quite early on there are a great deal more shadings to his character and Cumberbatch is superb in a role he took over from Paul Dano. Plemons, on the other hand, never quite develops beyond being the decent family man though both Dunst and Smit-McPhee are excellent.You could say the other major 'character' in the film is the house where they live. A great gothic pile standing in the middle of nowhere, (the film was shot in the vast open spaces of New Zealand standing in for Montana), this house is as memorable as those in "Giant" and "Days of Heaven". As with all of Campion's films nothing here is rushed. This is no more an action film than something Terrence Malick might turn out, (Malick is another point of reference), and consequently will be more suited to the art-house than the multiplex but in its simple, direct and unadorned way it's as good as anything you will see this year and it shouldn't be missed."

","But with a gritty and insolvent story about cattling out in nowhere montana in the 1920's. Its a 2 brother drama, much like kain and abel caracters, as one being sweet and careful, and the other just filled with silly old grumpiness and an, at that time, rather unheard of devotion towards same sex or being drawn to men. When romace comes into the nice brothers life things get even worse, in a complicated and elussive manner, and the story, plot and musical score is made to make you feel uncomfortable all the way to a bitter end.Its probably a book made into a movie, with a production level at the higher level, but the audiences being satisfied from this fairytail, cant be of the large kind. Mr cumberbachts inovative rawhide temper will dissapoint many, but hes doing it good though, and mrs dunst hasnt reached much longer than the spiderman roles she used to play. And to round up the acts, mr plemmons is at his homefield getting this role, as calm careful, naive and non advetourous, a nick nack caracter that he usually has done in past presences.Scenicly its brilliantly shot, nature barren lands have got its story told and the dark wave sensation youll get will hang in there in the aftermath, much thanks to some awly and dark cello music always in thereso as a drama it delivers, its not a wild wst flick in the good old way, and its far from comedy as you can get. The foggy fewreshly ending that shows the viewer this happened in the pre penicillum era do point a finger how rustling like was out in nowhere back then. It got even worse in the years that came with depression and those economic hardships, it may give the makers an opportunity to make an unintetional sequel, though the grumpy old man dont hope so. Esthetique and slow hand in hand, waiting for the action, shootouts and blood to run that never came was a disapointment to me, therefore a recommend with reservations."

"," Eerie and Complex ","The Power of the Dog (2021) is an exceptional and complex film from Jane Campion. She wrote and directed this Western set in Montana in 1925 (it's based on a novel). Story has two dour brothers (Benedict Cumberbatch, Jesse Plemons) who live together in a massive barn of a house on the plains. When Plemons ups a marries a local hotel keeper (Kirsten Dunst) it sets in motion a weird tale of repressive rage.Plemons is a tad dim and doesn't realize that Dunst is unsuited to ranch life. She herself quickly starts hitting the bottle. Her son is gay and is even more unsuited to the life than she is. Cumberbatch is a filthy, stinking cowboy who resents the mother and son. Things start getting interesting when we learn he has a Classics degree from Yale. He has a few more secrets that unfold when he seems to befriend the awkward son.Slow and complex story keeps the viewer wondering exactly what's next. Nothing is ever really explained or articulated but we can read between the lines. The first clue may be that the brothers share a bed in the rambling house.Acting is terrific and Cumberbatch and Dunst turn in especially good performances. The son is played by Kodi Smit-McPhee. Keith Carradine shows up briefly as the governor. Campion filmed this one in New Zealand and the whole look of the film (all those damned dark, muted colors again) is other worldly.

He's a terrible choice for a cowboy roll. He can't pull off the look or the accent. He does better in other kinds of roles. IDK if the son (Peter, who is studying to be a doctor) ended Phil, or if Phil contracted the infection when he was castrating the bull, which is when he was cut.

What I do mind is slow, long films that take my time for granted by spinning out the story, as this does. You can only hope for so long that a main character who is completely obnoxious might be heading for redemption or something. The scene where he abuses a horse (as he does everyone else) is not necessary to show how bad he is. That's been hammered home for half an hour - which seemed like three.There's no mystery, no suspense; just Phil being nasty.By Part III, it's pretty plain that Nasty Phil is nothing more than nasty. Fine, that's established. By this time I had lost interest in whether Phil lived, died, or jumps a horse through a ring of fire.

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10293406/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," A well-acted but otherwise mediocre western that does little to reinvigorate the genre ",""The Power of the Dog" is a western drama film based on the 1967 novel of the same name by Thomas Savage. Starring Benedict Cumberbatch, Jesse Plemons, Kirsten Dunst, Kodi Smit-McPhee, and directed by Jane Campion (The Piano), it's a well-acted but otherwise mediocre western that does little to reinvigorate the genre.In 1925, the Burbank brothers Phil (Benedict Cumberbatch) and George (Jesse Plemons) run a successful cattle ranch in Montana. One day while heading toward the markets, the brothers stop by a restaurant operated by the recently widowed Rose (Kirsten Dunst) and her son Pete (Kodi Smit-McPhee). The hot-headed Phil treats the mother and son pair cruelly but the kind-hearted George feels drawn towards Rose, culminating in a romantic relationship and eventually marriage. Refusing to accept them into the family, Phil continues his mistreatment of Rose and Pete until he soon sees the value in taking the latter under his wing as a new protg.There haven't been too many good Western films made recently. The genre is growing stale and feels as though it is on its way out. It also doesn't help that it has already been combined with virtually every other genre imaginable ranging from horror to science fiction. A film like "The Power of the Dog" attempts to go for a relatively straightforward Western experience with its basic setting on a ranch but it ultimately falls short of greatness.Although I wouldn't exactly call it boring, I didn't find myself particularly invested in the story. The basic plot is just the Burbank brothers working on their ranch with the occasional angry outburst from Phil. The stark contrast between Phil's overtly aggressive demeanour and George's gentle nature is never properly explored. It is hinted that they have inherited the ranch from their father but aside from that, we are never told important background information about what they were like before his passing. This is a missed opportunity as I wish we could have seen which of the brothers takes after their father the most. A plotline involving the siblings competing with each other over which of them is more worthy of being in charge of the family business would have made for a much more interesting film, however, the two of them are shown to get along reasonably well. Even with Phil's outward hostility towards Rose and Pete isn't enough to put a strain on the brothers' familial closeness. Instead, George just seems to brush it off as a minor inconvenience.Jane Campion, who wrote and directed the 1993 classic "The Piano", tries her hand here with the Western genre. She shows the vast sweeping landscape of the American mid-west and some creative camera angles to emphasise how small humans look in comparison. Unfortunately, moments like this are so fleeting that they barely leave an impact. Each time it seemed like the film was about to blow me away with epic visuals, the scene would abruptly end. It's a huge shame because I loved how Campion was able to immerse the audience in colonial era New Zealand in "The Piano" so it's surprising she wasn't able to replicate similar techniques here. I'm not sure if it's her inexperience with Westerns in general or if she's just simply lost her way over the years but I felt underwhelmed with what she presented to us here.One of the few redeeming features of this film is the quality of its acting. Benedict Cumberbatch is pretty convincing as a ranch owner with a short temper. Even though his character seemed underwritten, I liked what Cumberbatch was able to do with the material given to him. His unpredictability was one of the main reasons the film wasn't a total bore, as it kept me in suspense over what he would do next. Additionally, his American accent has improved considerably over the years, not at all sounding slightly British like it used to in the past. He also shared decent chemistry with Jesse Plemons as his brother, but as I mentioned earlier, I wish the film did a better job at exploring the fraternal relationship between the two of them.In conclusion, "The Power of the Dog" simply doesn't do enough to help revitalise the dying Western genre. Though there's nothing outright terrible about it, as there are some things that prevent the film from being a complete failure, there's nothing really worth recommending either. Coming from an otherwise talented filmmaker like Jane Campion, this is especially disappointing.I rate it 5/10."

Going in, I had slight skepticisms based on what people were saying about it after the big film festival premieres the past couple of months. Even before its trailer release, almost everyone predicted it as the best picture frontrunner. And though I'm not quite sure it'll take the big win, there is no way this will miss out on much (unless the forces of mainstream audiences, who will most likely find it too slow and strange, make it miss the chance). Jane Campion writes and directs this with subtext. Nothing is ever said plainly. We have to piece together what it's trying to say or what happened that wasn't necessarily shown the way it happened. If you've ever watched A Streetcar Named Desire (and you should!) this is a good comparison film. The film turns from a slow-burn drama into a psychological "thriller" of mind games. The way the film diverges into this on-edge atmosphere worked with me in such a manner that I forgot I was sitting in a theater. Campion's writing is very good and could honestly win adapted screenplay among multiple critic bodies and awards circuits. Lines stick with you well after their said. Even the trailer showcases great dialogue. Basically, Campion knew exactly what she was making front start to finish.Followed by her amazing writing and directorial skills, the performances are the next best thing here. Benedict Cumberbatch will be the most talked about part of the film. He's so intimidating and mysterious. By far his best work yet and it will be hard to top himself. He's such a mean person, but when the moment comes that you realize what has caused him to act in such a way, everything comes together and you have to think for yourself whether you like him or not. Kodi Smit-McPhee is the surprise star to emerge. His career has been quiet, but never disappoints. Peter is the most most relatable character within the story and I don't think audiences will have a problem connecting with him. The buzz will come for him, though I'm not quite sure what they'll do with it. And then there's Kirsten Dunst. This role is like a return to acting sort of thing. Everybody knows her and recognizes her as a great actress, but since Melancholia talk about her has ceased. Well, she's really good in here. Rose transforms heavily throughout. She's a very sweet woman, but as Cumberbatch's Phil attempts to drive her insane, she switches into something unforeseen. Jesse Plemons starts out fairly prominent but his screen time diminishes. Still, good work from him. The other two characters of the film are the cinematography and score. This isn't shot like another western. We get those beautiful landscapes and cattle shots, but it's rich in style and beauty. I love what they show and what they don't. Then, Jonny Greenwood (going for a double nomination this year with Spencer as the other) makes such an unsettling a beautiful score. It's not what you'd expect to hear going in, but as it starts and continues throughout the film (and there's lots of it), you see the character that it is. Besides a strange way to start and an abrupt moment towards the end, The Power of the Dog blew me away more than I expected. Will this be for everyone? No. You can't expect a western, but you can expect some of those elements. What the film is about is what it takes to go mad with power. Check it out on Netflix this winter!"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10293406/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Strong study ","A strong character study focusing mainly on the masculinity concept (and reasons to adopt different attitudes towards it), past, acceptance (by yourself, but also by the others) and how to deal with your insecurities. All the main characters are seen through these lens and the film is very efficient on that. Fantastic direction and cinematography and great acting overall, but especially by Cumberbatch and Dunst.Only cons? Personally, I felt the ending rushed, but that was clearly the option and I can understand why that was the choice. My main concern was that the film opened too many doors and some themes weren't enough explored, with no closure or a deeper analysis about them.Either way, a very good film."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10293406/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Slow in places hence the score, other than that superb. ","The casting and subsequent acting is faultless, which being as real life couple Plemons and Dunst weren't first choice shows the ability of Campion. It could have been edited a bit tighter as there some pace drop-offs, but when you think about the setting and cast ability you can understand the reasoning. Campion's vision of Montana is beautiful, although it's actually New Zealand, sorry Montanans."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10293406/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," High calibre, without a gun in sight ","Film adaptations of novels can be weighed down by their literary origins, but not this one. Thanks to Jane Campion's skills as a writer-director, this is cinema of the highest calibre.A tale of dangerous repression and emotional manipulation, the tension in the telling is almost tangible. Campion achieves this without resorting to melodrama, but by sheer intensity. The quartet of leading actors is unbeatable, with revelatory performances from Benedict Cumberbatch and Kirsten Dunst. They are well matched by Jesse Plemons and Kodi Smit-McPhee, in less rangy but nevertheless demanding roles.Campion has, as ever, brought the best out of her collaborators, notably cinemtographer Ari Wegner and editor Peter Sciberras. The magnificant score, a classic if ever there was one, is by Jonny Greenwood."

","I wasted exactly 2 hrs listening to violins, horns and watching an all star cast doing a bunch of nothingness. Slow boring and super dull. Never seen Brokeback Mountain but it's seems like this may have had a notion of it. Honestly this should've been called.....the power of falling asleep....sheesh."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10293406/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," One Part Piano, Two Parts Brokeback Mountain ","Jane Campion seems to be one of those feminists who spends all her days raging against the irredeemable boorishness and brutality of men and all her nights jilling herself silly to fantasies of being ravished by the very worst examples of them. I believe I've seen just about every film she's ever made, and I really can't say I've taken away anything more from them than that.'In The Cut' and 'Holy Smoke' both had brief moments of interest, but the truth of the matter is she's only made one film of any substance, and that's 'The Piano'. This one seems about one part that and two parts 'Brokeback Mountain', but there doesn't seem to be any reason for it to exist and it has absolutely nothing of any interest to say. It's a dull anti-story with tiresome dialogue and underdeveloped, unconvincing, characters, somewhat ameliorated by competent acting and cinematography.There's two hours of runtime and about 10 minutes of tale. One gets the impression she desperately wanted to make a 'There Will Be Blood' but somehow ended up with a slightly gay 'Heaven's Gate'."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10293406/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," Complex, spellbinding and incredibly well performed. ","This is one of those films that grabs you by the throat, or the chin, and refuses to let go until the credits roll.It follows the book that it's based on, by Thomas Savage, very closely. Though it may look like a simple story - an angry rancher who torments his brother's new wife and son when they come to live with him - it's much more complicated and fascinating than that.Phil Burbank is a toxic man's man and loves to show it off: easily offended, filthy, hands on, cruel, homophobic, suspicious and a bachelor. But as the story moves on, a different side to him is shown: one of raw vulnerability, loneliness, deep self-hatred and alienation.He is someone who is brilliant at ranching and loves the lifestyle. But the exact thing he loves prevents him from being who he is: a gay man. Which is a big no-no in this time and place.At first he sees Peter, his new nephew, as a weakling deserving of mockery and taunts. But when he sees that not only is the boy highly intelligent, but also immune to his cow hands's insults, he takes a shine to him and begins to show him the ropes of the ranch's lifestyle.As this is a Jane Campion film, don't expect a happy conclusion or a happy feeling when going into this film. It's rough, gritty, gut-wrenching and has non stop tension throughout. There were a few funny moments, such as Phil's brother George's inability to string two words together at times, or Phil's deliberate lack of social skills, but they come sparingly.George, despite being the kind one, is not without flaws (none of the main characters are). He is completely clueless to his wife's sufferings and how she would feel being at the ranch all day, away from her life in the inn, and being tormented by her brother in law. The Burbank ranch is not exactly a place for a woman. It's certainly not a place for a woman like Rose, who is easily brought to tears and insecure, and even less so (or so it seems) a boy like Peter. So she turns into an alcoholic, giving Phil a reason to turn George and Peter against her.To say this is an intense watch is an understatement. The shots of New Zealand, posing as Montana, and Johnny Greenwood's score is overpowering and completely breathtaking.But it's Benedict Cumberbatch who steals the show, committing full on to the complex and difficult role and capturing all the little nuances of the character with a delicate precision. I always knew he was one of the absolute greats of actors. I'm just incredibly happy so many more people can see it now."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10293406/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," A critical lens turned on toxic masculinity. Brilliant! ","Easily the best performance of Benedict Cumberbatch's career, 'The Power of the Dog' is a riveting western that focuses on the perils of toxic masculinity and strained family relationships.Cumberbatch and the talented Jesse Plemons star as a pair of diametrically opposite brothers who quietly fued in their 1920s ranch house as one brother does not approve of the other's new bride.Cumberbatch plays the alpha male cowboy, dominating his more reserved and empathetic brother.Kirsten Dunst is electric as the new woman who gets in between the brothers and her quiet, effeminate and seemingly nave son (an electric Kodi Smit-McPhee) takes a shine to Cumberbatch's rough and tumble nature.Cumberbatch elevates this film, playing an able foil for director Jane Campion's grand vision to throw light on how toxic masculinity can corrupt even the most noble souls and fracture families and relationships.This slow burn captivates with the acting chops of its leads and the taut climax will leave you entranced. A must see film sure to rake in the awards this year!Highly recommended!"

But then others take away a lot. I really don't want to break it all down here; suffice it to say, this movie is a mixed bag.However, the last few scenes had this build up that left me feeling teased and cheated, and almost rather rushed. It was bad enough that there were two plots running along, and neither really took off. But to just be done and get one little Bible quote to explain the title and actions of the character...yeah, that went right past my head and left me actually upset.I'd say it's not the worst thing I've seen, but I think that's mostly because I enjoy Benedict Cumberbatch stealing the damn show."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10295212/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Shershaah leaves you in tears as well as celebrates hardcore patriotism with commercialized jingoism in War Drama. ","Shershaah (2021) : Movie Review -War Drama is one of the biggest genre in World cinema since last 100 years or maybe more. Hollywood celebrated this genre like no one else with World War 1 and & World War 2 subjects whereas foreign language cinema focused more on the realistic effects and horrors of the same. In Bollywood, 'Haqeeqat' set a benchmark which hasn't been crossed yet by any other film and for the commercial and massy elements 'Border' became a landmark. Even Border had that unrealistic jingoism but for 90s audience it was overwhelming stuff and the film still enjoys a cult following in TV audience. Recently, the biggest thing came in this genre was 'Uri : The Surgical Strike' which wasn't a great film at all but the timing was so accurate that people just went for it without thinking about anything. Those actual events happened around its release left people with anger and the outburst was already captured by the film hence the box office numbers surpassed all expectations. Shershaah is as good as Uri, so yes it also repeated the same mistakes but again, the same commercialized outlook has saved the film. A shocking thing about Shershaah is, it's extremely emotional film in those last 10 minutes which leaves everyone with teary eyes.Tracing the life journey of Param Vir Chakra awardee and army captain Vikram Batra, it stars Sidharth Malhotra in a double role, as Batra and his identical twin brother Vishal, while Kiara Advani plays the role of Vikram's girlfriend Dimple Cheema. The film does not have any defaming material as we have seen in few films recently and that's why the clean image of army and soldiers fills your chest with pride. Having a burden of relating to biographical genre, the film struggles to establish few important things and in between the love story and the songs do irritate a little bit. Thankfully, that's not too irritating so one can easily pass those moments to enjoy some great moments later.Performance of Sidharth Malhotra is the best we have seen so far. Actually, this is his only 2nd or 3rd acting oriented role while other times he was busy playing a cool, funky guy and here he gets that potential role to showcase different side of his talent. Kiara Advani is more of a powdered doll and if you exclude songs then Shershaah is like a cameo role for her. The Army gang is decent, nothing great which includes Nikitin Dheer, Shiv Pandit and Himmanshoo Malhotra in major roles. Music is fine despite having a misjudged timing in the screenplay. Editing and VFX are okay, though, more accuracy would have been better. Shershaah never bores you because it's a pacy film, the credit should go to the well written screenplay.War Genre is an open genre, it does not limit you with anything so it can be used for anything you want. Hollywood used it for patriotic films, for musicals, for biographicals, for controversial films, for hard-hitting dramas and for sensational theories. Even recently Hollywood made Masterpiece films like 'The Hacksaw Ridge' and '1917'. Well, Bollywood is far behind. When Hollywood made a film like 'Patton', Bollywood was not even making mainstream war films and what a freaking amazing classic Patton was and is even today. That high-quality filmmaking is missing now days and for bollywood it's like, almost 50 years ahead from Today. We can be happy with films like Uri and Shershaah as our masses and TV audience would never complain about it so Yes, Shershaah is definitely watchable. Director Vishnuvardhan has certainly made a watchable film. But never forget that the potential for Biographical-War drama is always unlimited, and like I said not every film can be 'Patton'. So, overall Shershaah has everything one can expect from a commercial patriotic drama and i strongly believe that it deserved to be viewed on big screen.RATING - 6.5/10*"

The film outlines the affable and brave life of the soldier and pays homage to the hundreds of lives lost in Operation Vijay. However, it channels patriotism that limits the film's dramatic reach. The writer pounds the audience with dialogue about hero status when showing them would have sufficed. The surplus of scenes showing Batra facing ordnance and enemy fire forced spectacle to be the casualty. There are moving moments though, and nicely captured humour too, albethey confined to romantic interludes in Batra's civilian life. As for the war itself, there are some beautifully photographed landscapes and the action set-pieces are well choreographed in foreground. All in all, the film is watchable, flourishing in parts and the performances are all very good, but the direction is uneven."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10295212/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Every Indian Should Watch Brave Story Of Vikram Batra Brilliantly Portrayed By Sidharth Malhotra ","When ever there is a war, natural calamity or a terrorist attack, the first people to come out and protect is Indian Army, who selflessly support us with their act of bravery. With never-ending tension going between India and Pakistan, so many sacrifices are being made by our Indian soldiers whose duty is to save the citizen from the scum of the Earth. To honor the soldiers who have laid down their lives to serve the country, there are few movies being made to tell the stories of gallantry. One such movie is on the Vikram Batra biopic drama, Shershaah, which stars Sidharth Malhotra and Kiara Advani.Shershaah chronicles the life and story of the brave soldiers Vikram Batra (played by Sidharth Malhotra) who led a very difficult operation in Kargil War against Pakistan and even managed to pull down the enemy soldiers in hand combat, ensuring a solid victory for our motherland.Directed by Vishnu Vardhan, Shershaah is one such film which will keep you engaged right from the beginning till the electrifying climax. The powerful true story of Vikram Batra along with other soldiers who have sacrificed and struggled to ensure that safety of Indian citizen is their top most priority, The makers have done a fabulous job in portraying the stress, blood and sweat displayed by our honorable soldiers. Couple of scenes did caught my attention - Pakistani missiles hitting the Indian base in a surprise attack, the action scene at the police check point and last but not the least, the final showdown - which is the climax scene showing the ultimate sacrifice by Vikram Batra when he exposes himself to the enemy fire trying to drag the injured soldier to safety, and in the process was shot. We get to see the real heroes only through some newspaper articles or social media who fought for their country, sacrificed their family and could not even return back to their motherland. Thanks to films like Shershaah speaks the true events of making of a soldier and the hardship and struggle these war machines go through.The initial reels had romantic track showing how Vikram Batra meets his fiancee Dimple hampers the momentum of the biopic drama, though the chemistry between Sidharth Malhotra and Kiara Advani is sparkling. Also, it is high time, Bollywood can start making biopics without songs and melodrama which sometimes play the spoilsports. Nevertheless, writing by Sandeep Shrivastava is brilliant which should be lauded. Technically, Shershaah boast off brilliant cinematography capturing the beautiful locales of Kashmir and Ladakh. Art direction is mind-blowing while background score creates more tensionTalking about performance, Sidharth Malhotra essays the role of Vikram Batra with T. The actor successfully shows diverse expressions of Vikram Batra right from the beginning when he joins the Indian Army as a rookie to the gallant soldier who fights for his country till his last breath. Shershaah might be a turning point in Sidharth Malhotra's career who comes up with a brave performance. In the supporting role, Kiara Advani, Shiv Pandit and Nikitin Dheer have acted their part with equal justice.So overall, Shershaah is a spellbinding tale of a brave soldier which should be lauded and appreciated for its genuine attempt. Very good 3.5/5."

","Story: It's Vikram Batra's Biopic, his wish to be in army right from his childhood, his love life, his life among friends and family, his life as an army lieutenant. Apart from that it's shown how he is a pioneer in catching terrorist Haider and finally what role he plays in gaining back control over Mount Kargil.Cinematography: Justified. The family, the friends, the residence, the mounts, the base, the flowing water, the gurudwara, etc add to the viewing experience.Direction: Justified. The character of Vikram is shown playful. If that's true Director has done good job in portraying it. If not it makes me uneasy.Acting (& music): Acting is average. The music goes well along with the movie. The songs are well above average. You will find couple of them among your favorites.Final Verdict: When Dharma productions put their sweat into something, things turn out mostly well.The result is entertaining. Same being why you would choose 'Shershaah' over 'State of Seige: Temple Attack'. To be peculiar, when just motion picture is considered over brand of content.The movie is nice, do watch it, if you have time."

","Shershaah review :After watching Karan Johar's Student of the Year (2012), I had put my bets on Sidharth Malhotra over the other two debutants. Later, Varun and Alia raced ahead with successful films while the Malhotra dude lagged behind. With Karan Johar's latest production Shershaah which released on Amazon Prime on Friday, Sidharth proves his mettle as a fine actor who can shine under the right script and a competent director.A biopic on Param Veer Chakra awardee Kargil war hero Captain Vikram Batra, Shershaah has some awe-inspiring battle sequences giving you a feel of actually being right there with our Indian Army jawaans as they take on the Pakistani infiltration of 1999. The technical aspects are first rate, the background score perfectly suits the context and the presentation consciously avoids unnecessary jingoism. Director Vishnuvardhan makes a super Bollywood debut and full credit to him for making a touching film which will make your eyes moist in the end.The performances are top class - Sidharth delivers his career best as Capt. Batra. Kiara Advani is earnest playing his lady love. Nikitin Dheer looks convincing as Capt. Batra's senior. So does Shiv Pandit. As the end credits roll, we get to see all the real life heroes of the war and it is then you realise how the actors playing them on screen are perfectly cast in these roles.Shershaah deserved a theatrical release but has made it to OTT in these covid times. I recommend a watch with family and friends. The film is truly inspiring and makes you feel proud of our army bravehearts for whom India is above their own life. Durge Maa Ki Jai!!!Regards, Sumeet Nadkarni."

He was an officer of the Indian Army, who got posthumously awarded with the Param Vir Chakra, India's highest and most prestigious award for valour, for his actions during the 1999 Kargil War in Kashmir between India and Pakistan.It's not just a typical war movie but is a life story of a national hero. This movie showed different sides of capt. Vikram Batra's personality which made us love him more. He was more than a war hero. He had a filmy, sweet lover in him too. The whole movie was a mix of so much emotions. Climax had me in tears. The love story was unique and beyond expectations. Really felt a big respect of Dimple mam.Starting from the promotional JaiHind ki Senaa; all the songs including Raatan lambiyan and Raanjha was masterpieces.Sidharth Malhotra He lived the character. Totally nailed it. Each and every emotion was nicely potrayed.Surely his best performance so far.Acting out a real life character is not an easy task.Talking about Kiara Advani, Kiara has done a good job and I am quite impressed with her accent particularly the Punjabi speaking skills she has shown in the film. Worth taking a note of it.Lastly I would say, you can watch this film more than once. So good is the film. I would also thank the makers for displaying photos and names of the original war heroes in the end part of the film. These army men deserve their glory and honor. We are all proud of them."

",""Yeh Dil Maange More"Movies on Nationalism are often castigated for their commonly seen melodramatic appearance or the redundancy in the specific pattern they tend to follow. For a film that appertains to Bollywood's mainstream lineup; Shershaah is comparatively more grounded and respectful of the source material!Technical competencies aside, the Director (Vishnuvardhan) ensured that the film stays on the path of verisimilitude. Regardless, it gets ever so slightly exaggerated at certain points but for the most part; Vishnuvardhan's vision has been hell-bent on doing it in the most believable way possible.Sticking with my earlier statement, I find the technical sides to be pretty darn impressive. Given the fact that it is coming from Bollywood (They don't have as much budget as Hollywood or other foreign film industries); Got to admit, I was stupefied just looking at all those expertly choreographed combats, further intensified by an incredible Score that truly elevated the anxiety as well as the fervor in a few.Moving forward to the Performances...Since the day of the announcement; fans were eager to witness Siddharth Malhotra as Capt. Vikram Batra. Needless to say, he seized this opportunity and rose to the occasion! I firmly believe that this would be remembered as one of Siddharth's career highlights. On the other end, despite having a somewhat less important, short-lived role; Kiara Advani played her part with complete dedication and full commitment. Not to mention, the great chemistry these two seem to share.I see some reviewers are arguing about the Non-War segments; especially referring to the Love Story. I think they are completely missing the point. This isn't a film about Kargil War or Operation Vijay, it is utterly dedicated to Captain Vikram Batra's courageous feats. It was rather a necessity to rightly establish Batra's personal life so that we as the audience could connect to him at a more personal level.And I have to say, they did very well in that regard!Before I conclude, I would like to pay my respects to all the Soldiers, Army Personnel who have sacrificed their lives just to keep us safe. They do all that is necessary for the sake of protecting our beloved country from the enemy forces. I, as a responsible citizen of India, couldn't be more proud of them.Thank you for your service!"

So I would say the director,editor and the screenplay writer deserve an applause for their extra hardworks that's visible in the narrative. I was pleasantly surprised by the cinematography and the score of the movie, such a nice treat. Personally, I am happy for Siddharth for this opportunity to explore his craft and proving that he has lot more to provide as an actor. I have always loved him and so maybe my regards for him might have been subjective but still the movie left a mark for him. The supporting casts are good in their roles. Overall, a fine movie that hits the right node as a Bollywood entertainer. It's always a pleasure to see the real footage and the people that the movie bases on so it was an appreciative tribute to the real heroes. Even as a non Indian movie lover, I approve the message that the movie hits its audience in right sentimental values What did not work: Maybe I would have been happier if the movie had paused on the main character's introspection, his vulnerabilities, his moments at the camp or the training scenes so that we could gather more depth of his principles and his way of life as an army. Just an open suggestion.Final verdict: highly recommended. I would have been happier for Siddharth if the movie was released on theaters because it would have definitely banked some long term investment for him."

Also, it showcases his love story with dimple cheema.What I liked the most about shershaah was its minimal tone of jingoism and patriotism. Its not overdone like those jp dutta war films. I liked its first half more than the second half because it was the right mixture of fun, romance, emotion, action and thrill. The love story of vikram and dimple was decent. War sequences were pretty good.Coming to performances, sidharth malhotra gave a sincere performance as Vikram Batra. For the first time, I saw his charisma on screen, thanks to vikram batra's heroic personality. He easily got into the skin of the character. Kiara advani also gave a very memorable performance as dimple and both sid and kiara's chemistry was good. Rest of the supporting actors had small roles and they did it well. Tamil director vishnuvardhan's direction is good.On the whole, shershaah is one of the best biopics which ever came in Bollywood. Its not only relief for sidharth malhotra but also for karan johar and dharma productions who received lot of flak last year."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10295212/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," About a brilliant life and a tale of national pride ",""Shershaah" (for the uninitiated, it is the codename for Captain Vikram Batra of the Indian Armed Forces, who led his unit to thwart the Pakistani army infiltration in Kargil) is a remarkable film that ticks all the boxes. It keeps the viewer glued to the screen, runs focused and taut, is an edge of the seat thriller with excellent production values, and is supplanted on a mammoth commercial scale. It is sleek, boasts of superlative editing by A. Sreekar Prasad, cinematography by Kamaljeet Negi, music by Y. S. Raja, and of some spectacular VFX by a team that should easily qualify for top awards. Shershaah, helmed by Vishnuvardhan is undoubtedly a film that's out to grab a whole lot of attention, admiration, accolades and leaves a strong imprint on the hearts and minds about the life of a fearless and exemplary individual.Shershaah achieves a lot more than just that. It doesn't waste time on gimmicks like Pakistan-bashing and remains steady on the biopic of Captain Vikram Batra, its key objective. It has an understated glamour keeping in tune with the protagonist's background, education, family, love life and his one dimensional determination to achieve his objective. It races down to the finishing line at an admirable speed, that left me at least with a an emotion of "yeh dil maange more"! Shershaah could play for a few minutes more, and I wouldn't complain.Siddharth Malhotra comes to life with perhaps what I would label as his best performance. He is uninhibited, impulsive, expressive in an understated manner and immensely likeable. I am certain that Captain Vikram Batra would have been proud and happy to see that Siddharth Malhotra has done justice. Shataf Figar as Col. Y. K. Joshi adds gravitas and is impressive as the officer who had faith in Batra, allowing him to lead a strategic fightback to retrieve lost ground. Kiara Advani has a brief role but is delightful. Shiv Panditt, Raj Arjun, Nikitin Dheer and Pawan Chopra are great support. In the end, Shershaah leaves you teary eyed and emotional, filled with passion, stirring up patriotism and a renewed appreciation for the armed forces. Don't miss Shershaah, it's perhaps the best film of the year."

My world view before this was that everything with Siddharth Malhotra in it must be in the nether regions on the scale of quality cinema.

The film is full of spirit. There is no showing of forceful patriotism which was all over there in Bhuj trailer.

","When the movie is based a real life Kargil war hero like Captain Vikram Batra, there was no room for error for makers Karan Johar and Vishnu Varadhan. And thankfully, they have made a superb film that will really resonate with audiences and pay due homage to the Param Veer Chakra awardee.Siddharth Malhotra's limited acting chops is adeptly managed by the director by using body language and a fantastic supporting cast that includes the brilliant Kiara Advani, Shiv Pandit and Raj Arjun.The iconic Barkha Dutt interview and the legendary 'Dil Maange More' catchphrase sequences are delivered with enough punch and verve to get your adrenaline pumping. This has to be the best Indian war movie yet in terms of production value with the high-elevation fight sequences shot with Hollywood-level panache.Director Vishnu Vardhan deftly switches between the soldier's life in the army and his budding romance with his college sweetheart, giving us a glimpse into both the warrior and the human side of the legendary war-hero.A special shout out is needed for the fantastic music and BGM from maestro Yuvan Shankar Raja that really elevates the narration, especially in the emotional sequences. The climax song will hardly leave a dry eye in the house.Captain Vikram Batra was a true braveheart and I am thankful that this is a tribute film deserving of the great man. Recommended!"

Amazing."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10295212/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," An Inspiring War Drama Of Braveheart's And Victories !!! ","The Kargil War, 1999 - the toughest mountain warfare ever. Fought at a dizzying altitude of 17,000 feet, this historic war had a lot at stake. The Pakistani troops had infiltrated into the Indian side of the Line of Control (LoC), disguised as Kashmiri militants. The skirmishes quickly escalated into a full-blown war that also chalked the journey of a soldier from Lieutenant to Captain for his absolute dare-devilry and patriotic spirit to unfurl the tricolour at the highest point of conflict. Even if that meant laying down his own life for the cause.But before we get there, director Vishnu Varadhan and his writer Sandeep Srivastava take it slow. So we are taken right back to a childhood sequence of Captain Vikram Batra (Sidharth Malhotra) and shown his growing up years, finding the love of his life Dimple Cheema (Kiara Advani), before he is finally posted at the 13 JAK Rifles as a Lieutenant. While this build-up depicts the character's journey, it doesn't do so very sharply to merit so much screentime. In fact, most of the times, Kiara Advani's track and the romantic songs featuring her, feel like a distraction from the heavy-duty subject at hand. This also impacts the pace of the film that suffers from a slow first half.Of course, director Vishnu Varadhan had a mammoth task of doing justice to the copious amounts of data and milestones from the Kargil war, but the bulk of it is dealt with, in the second half. Sidharth Malhotra shines in the war scenes and his performance evolves through the film. His earnest efforts to recreate the aura of his character's larger-than-life persona shows on screen and this is one of his better performances. Kiara Advani looks her part as a resolute Sardarni, who loves her man with all her heart. But she doesn't have much scope to perform.Shiv Panditt is very aptly cast as Captain Sanjeev Jamwal, who is tough on the outside, but emotional from within. Nikitin Dheer is impressive as the cheerful Major Ajay Singh Jasrotia and so is Shataf Figar as the straight talking Col. Yogesh Kumar Joshi. Together, these men make for an able team that you will root for, at all times. Among the many other character actors, there are a few stereotypes and clichs too, especially on the Pakistani side.The film's overall tone is obviously high on patriotism. Many combat scenes don't reflect the large canvas that the film is set up on, perhaps more deserving of a big screen experience. Yet, as an industry, Bollywood has seldom churned out epic war films that have been critically and commercially acclaimed. By those standards, 'Shershaah' ranks high than most of the recent war dramas and tells an inspiring story that needs to be told.The source material of this film is so strong that it is bound to grip you once the men in uniform take it upon themselves to drive out the enemy and reclaim our land. 'Shershaah's biggest victory is its effort to recreate one of the most important chapters of our recent history with characters, who lead the way to a rousing climax."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10295212/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," Amazing! Must watch! ","A perfect tribute to the Captain Batra! Must watch. Some fake scenes were added though, it's not a complete and actual life story of Capt. Vikram batra. Still you can enjoy this. Thank you."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10295212/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Better than URI ","Hatred towards enemy (is not equals to) Love for country URI was almost as fundamentalist as insurgent.Even they went to an extent to malign the whole country and the govt. There may could be some truth to it, but linear and black-and-white perspective never helps except polarizing people even more. And that is never a solution.URI disturbed me with it's army-mentality and millitary-bravado. Glamourizing wars!Because of all that, I was very hesitant to watch this movie.But Shershah has what URI lacked, i.e. EMPATHY and Heart.Also, I differ with people critiquing Kiara or her character for lacking depth. But I sincerely disagree. She has a character and a personality. She warns, disagrees, takes initiative and much more.Point being. This is a Vikram Batra movie, NO Character except the protagonist is given any extra screen time. The movie revolves around it.I respect and appreciate that the whole second half of the movie deals with the war only. But that half could've been better and felt underwhelming after the first half (jus too much firing and grenade).Of course, I could be biased here, as I'm anti-war. And also, battleground is serious business and not* supposed to be entertaining.Needless to say that, the music jus takes your heart away. And you'll keep humming it for days to come.Genuine doubt- why only Indians climbing the mountain are using grenade and cannon. Where as it's much convenient for the Pakistani who control the base from the top."

But of course, since it was a movie that I hadn't already seen, of course I had to sit down and watch it.And I will say that writers Mikhael Bassilli and MJ Palo actually managed to put together a storyline that actually proved entertaining. Sure, this wasn't a movie that revolutionized the thriller genre in any way, but it proved to be enjoyable and watchable.The storyline is pretty straight forward, and while not really offering anything much new to the thriller genre, the writers had managed to construct the storyline in a way that it was actually entertaining. And "Baby Money" made for a fair watch."Baby Money" is driven by equal parts storyline and character gallery. I found the characters in the movie to be interesting and actually have enough contents to them to prove interesting. And that definitely counted for something in this movie.The movie doesn't have a large cast ensemble, but that was actually not an issue, because the actors and actresses in the movie put on good performances. I will say that the lead performers Danay Garcia, Michael Drayer, Joey Kern and Taja V. Simpson actually carried the movie well with their performances and were good at bringing their characters to life on the screen.While "Baby Money" is a watchable thriller, I feel that it is hardly a movie that I will be returning to watch a second time, as the movie just doesn't seem to have the contents to it to support more than just a single viewing.My rating of directors Mikhael Bassilli and Luc Walpoth's movie lands on a six out of ten stars."

The story was nothing revolutionary for its genre, but it was character driven and different enough to keep you glued to the screen. Aside from some minor plot and technical issues, it had constant suspense, and the story progressed with decent continuity and cohesion. The 93 min runtime was just right, as was the pacing. Cinematography was excellent, and the score was perfect and fitting - a rare find in B films, which are normally loud, annoying, overbearing and unfitting.The casting and performances were spot on and convincing, especially Taja V.

Character sketching was very weak. Summing all these negatives it becomes un bearable in so many stages and we get some amateur vibes in terms of execution. In terms of casting wasn't impressed by VJS, I have no idea why would Shruthi Hassan or Sai Dhanshika would even accept roles which have literally zero impact.Verdict: Total disaster VJS star power couldn't save this sinking ship."

Of course someone else who may have issues and is more sensible and still reads as little as I do ... well we all have different views. So I'd understand if you don't like it like that.

While I could accept the sex scenes that go with the territory, I wasn't prepared to deal with the disjoint, pedestrian editing.Madame Claude is the occasional voice over, but her narrative is unreliable. For instance, she mentions she started her "career" as a prostitute (not much of a surprise) and we're shown a scene in the past where she defended a colleague from a customer's beating. You might assume Madame is against violence, but immediately after, one of her "girls" is subject to brutal beating and Madame comment is just "Wash and have a good sleep to forget about it".Then she proclaims she doesn't have the time for a "love story" and immediately after she's hooking up with a sleazy guy. The lack of consistency is not the only problem, the editing goes from past to present with no logic; the character of Madame's daughter is introduced for no reason and then abandoned; the sex scenes are way too frequent, so that the movie is more a soft porn that doesn't need a plot than a legitimate film."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10307724/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Much more than a "madam" ","SummaryInteresting and at times controversial biopic of the most influential pimp woman in France. Also a film about the many and sometimes surprising but inevitable derivations of high-end pimping.ReviewMadame Claude is concerned above all with the heyday of who was the most exalted and famous pimp woman in France during the presidencies of de Gaulle and Pompidou, how she ran her "house" and her "mansion" and her relationship with the circles of power.This Silvie Verhayde partial biopic of Fernande Grudet, aka Madame Claude, focuses on three aspects. On the one hand, she was the pimp of the most exclusive network of female prostitution for more than a decade, which led her to link with circles of power, organized crime and others that the viewer will discover, striking a dangerous balance between them. Coupled with her sixties setting, this sometimes surprising but unavoidable aspect of high-end pimping lends the film, at times, a fascinating and sophisticated spy-movie climate. Do not demand a broad development of these subplots from this film as if it were a documentary or a miniseries; they simply place us in what the protagonist negotiated, trafficked and dealt with.The other two aspects, closely related to each other, have to do with his private life and the way in which he managed his network, concentrated in high-end brothels (houses and later mansions), describing how he related to "his" prostitutes and the "Community" or "family" that they made up, which the film describes in an unbiased way, but without sparing any of its facets. This description of the intimate realm of VIP prostitution (and by extension of prostitution in general) will be controversial for some. In particular, Madame Claude's bond with whoever was her right hand, the enigmatic Sidonie (in a very good performance by Garance Mallinier, protagonist of the notable Voracious), develops. The director and actress Hafzsia Herzi also appears in the role of another call girl.Karole Roche carries out a very good interpretation, combining toughness, dryness and passion of her difficult and complex character, showing a Madame Claude determined to make a place in the male power plot, exercising tight control of her prostitution network with a imprint that went from the maternal to the despotic and ruthless and going through the difficult relationship with her family.The re-enactment of the period is very successful, with a soundtrack with French themes from the period very conveniently located and the usual European casualness in the intimate scenes."

I did a quick mental comparison to "Nymphomaniac" which likewise had its share of explicit scenes. Nymphomaniac left a few issues that could be explored after the fact, e.g., the cost and eventual outcome of addiction of any sort.

It does little to dive into the interesting characters that inhabit her story.Given the story's potential, one could imagine dramatic encounters with the police and her influential clients.

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10307724/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," The end is worth the wait ","I watched Madame Claude by Sylvie Verheyde on Netflix, which just premiered a couple of days ago. It's the second French biopic about "Madame Claude," ne Fernande Grudet, who operated the most illustrious brothel in Paris for fifteen years in the 1960's and 1970's--the first, also titled Madame Claude, by Just Jaekin, dates from 1977 and starred Francoise Fabian. I wasn't sure I would like the new version, since a few of the reviews panned it, but I decided to start watching it to see if I liked it. I watched it all. I saw it VOSTF--speaking French with French subtitles.The best thing about this film is that it is directed by a woman, Sylvie Verheyde. This is important, although little discussed by the mostly male critics and commentators, but I doubt that any male director could have enjoyed the intimacy with the almost entirely female cast. There is only one principal male character, the voyou--gangster--Jo Attia, played by veteran actor Roschdy Zem, who occupies a minor role. Most of the film ostensibly takes place in Madame Claude's maisons closes at 18, rue de Marignan, near the Champs-Elyses, and 32, rue de Boulainvilliers, a discrete location in the 16th.A crucial aspect of the film is mostly ignored by the American audience or even by French people who did not live in Paris in the 1960's and 1970's, as I did. A Yugoslav, Stevan Markovic, whose name is mispronounced by some of the characters, a Corsican, Franois Marcantoni, President George Pompidou, his wife, Claude, and the actor Alain Delon were all involved in a bombshell scandal that erupted in 1968 and is evoked a background to the film to suggest Madame Claude's connections with la pgre, the French underworld. According to the Wikipedia, the affair began when one of Delon's bodyguards, Markovic, was found dead. Both Delon and his longtime friend Marcantoni were questioned by the police. Marcantoni was originally charged with the murder, but after further questioning by the police, he was released. Markovic's murder is still unsolved.Most of the sexy scenes are near the beginning of the film. There are a few violent moments, but most of the film revolves around the entrepreneurial Madame Claude's business and the "Claudettes" she recruited for her wealthy and powerful clients. The end is worth the wait.There are several good articles online, some with cheesecake photos, about Madame Claude. Several books, including her 1994 autobiography, Madam, describe her life. She died in Nice in 2015 at the age of 92, keeping many of her secrets to her grave.French actress Karole Rocher is excellent in the title role and will probably garner a Cesar, the French equivalent of an Oscar, for her starring role as Madame Claude.The young Garance Marillier, born in 1998, is excellent as Sidonie, the daughter of a diplomat. The enigmatic Sidonie puffs or pretends to puff a Virginia Slims most of the time. (I checked: the iconic cigarettes premiered in 1968, the time of the film.) Sidonie becomes Madame Claude's favorite Claudette and her confidante.Because of some confusion in the script, I'd rate the film a B overall. It's worth watching, but not destined to become a classic. Netflix rates it "steamy" and "cerebral." Right, it probably is both."

Sidonie becomes Madame Claude's favorite Claudette and confidante.There are several good articles online, some with cheesecake photos, about Madame Claude. Books, including her 1994 autobiography, Madam, also describe her life and attempt to separate fact from fiction. She died in Nice in 2015 at the age of 92, taking many of her secrets of the rich and famous to the grave.What is not mentioned in the film, but in the published articles is that Madame Claude may have been Jewish. One of her friends, Taki Theodoracopulos, the longtime "High Life" columnist for London's Spectator, asserted to one of Madame Claude's biographers, William Stadiem, that he had seen Madame Claude's concentration camp tattoo on her wrist.Despite its subject matter, female prostitution, I consider Madame Claude to be a woman's movie if not a feminist film. That's because it's fundamentally about women acquiring power, especially the power over men. It's not only Madame Claude who exercised her power but the Claudettes, too, many of whom, after grooming by Madame Claude, tutoring in the arts and letters by scholars of her acquaintance and cosmetic surgery where required--except the breasts-- ended up marring princes, potentates and captains of industry.Netflix rates it "steamy" and "cerebral."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10309902/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," Chehre is 8 decades late to make a lame simulation of Hollywood Classic Double Indemnity with boring seminar on Justice And Law. ","Chehre (2021) : Movie Review -Chehre was looking dull right from the trailer and promos but the advantage of being a thriller kept it alive somehow. You know, many thriller don't open main cards before release to surprise you with the final product and that blur hope was still there with Chehre. However, now the final product seems suitable to that dull pre-release scenario or better say it even goes lower. If you remember Hollywood's Classic Noir 'Double Indemnity' (1944) directed by Master Billy Wilder then you must realise the fact that, Double Indemnity was kind of pioneer in this husband-killing formula. And it made too much sense for 40s but now seeing the story being adapted in 2021 is a Big Joke. How can someone even think of it? Chehre is disastrous attempt already but it doesn't have anything kind of original to stand on its own even in the rest of the narrative. Double Indemnity just gets extention for 40 more minutes where we are invited to attend a boring lecture on justice and law, the same what Amitabh delivered in Pink. But here it's completely out of the context as it is based on some silly game with unrealistic characters. Actually, even that seems copied from Marathi movie 'Me Shivaji Park', that entire portion of retired men serving justice in their own style, yes that's simply copy pasted.There is nothing to talk about Chehre's story as i have already mentioned that it simulates 'Double Indemnity' and even if i have to tell something then it would be termed as spoiler. Well, let me remind you the story of Double Indemnity instead. A beautiful woman married to a rich old guy plans to murder him to get his money of course. For that, she traps a young man by pretending to love him and then both of them commits a crime. Here, Emraan Hashmi is a married man so it takes away the all respect from his character. Two, he is well settled into corporate business so we assume that he has some brain which he eventually keeps aside while falling for this greedy woman. There are lot of stupid things to tell in this set of the story but let's just forget it and let's move towards even worse part. That remote bunglow in snow zone and those peculiar characters in that bunglow, what the heck was that? I mean, seriously? It's 2021 and you are using 18th century's Ideas for a film?Performances of all the actors are strictly average. Emraan plays an over-confident guy who shows off his arrogant grin smile after every confusedly spoken dialogue of Amitabh Bachchan. But for what? We all know the film won't have the same scenario after a while then why this show off? And how come one opens up all his secrets during a childish game? Annu Kapoor's punjabi accent was okay if was playing an illiterate guy, not for an educated character like a Lawyer. The same applies to Amitabh's character. How confusing his character was while asking questions. Rhea Chakroborty is there only to pass her time and Krystal D'Souza was signed only for Skin Show.Chehre may have many problems with its writing but the on screen presentation is damn hell pathetic and it's almost 50 years old. If i have to choose between Chehre and any average Hollywood Film of 40s to watch in theatre again then without any second thoughts i would ditch Chehre. Rumy Jafry couldn't even present the actual product with proper sense. In the film Big B' ls character asks, 'What is Law?'. Here i want to ask Rumy Jafry that, 'What is Filmmaking?'. Did he really made a film for 2021's audience? The loopholes in the film are not plausible even for 1921, that's 100 years back. Let me finish it in one sentence now, Chehre is a film which deserves that furious remark- 'Don't show me your FACE'...RATING - 4/10*"

Ranjit Kapoor and Rumy Jafry's screenplay is effective for most parts, especially in the first half. But the writing loses grip in the second half, more so towards the pre-climax. Ranjit Kapoor and Rumy Jafry's dialogues are sharp at several places. The 13-minute-long monologue, however, fails to make the desired impact and should have been shorter and should have had the required punch.Rumy Jafry's direction is impressive. For a director who has made light-hearted entertainers in the past to direct a thriller so well is praiseworthy. This is a challenging film as it's mostly set in one house. But he introduces the characters and their traits very well. The manner in which they take Sameer into confidence is very convincing. In fact, there are no complaints in the first half as the way he builds up the tension makes for a thrilling experience. Problem arises in the second half as it seems dragging. Also, the climax should have been better and nail-biting. The monologue also spoils the narrative. In the past, Amitabh Bachchan had rocked the show with the 'No Means No' dialogue in PINK . It was shorter and far more impactful. Something on those lines was required here but sadly, the monologue turns out to be never-ending and even goes off track. The other problem with the film is that it's quite dialogue-heavy. The makers have tried their best to infuse drama and tension wherever possible. But even then, audiences are not used to such a narrative and setting. Hence, a subject like this is experimental and would appeal to mostly urban and niche audiences.CHEHRE begins on a great note. Amitabh Bachchan's entry is clap worthy. The exchange of dialogues here is very smooth and convincing. The way Lateef manages to conclude that Sameer is a culprit through the power of his observation and experience of asking the correct questions keeps the interest going. The intermission point is shocking. The second half starts on an interesting note. The flashback of Sameer and Natasha (Krystle Dsouza) is refreshing as it gives audiences a break from the four-walls of the mansion where the film is set. Initially, it is captivating but towards the end of the flashback, the film becomes predictable. The twist in the very final scene of the film is quite impressive and helps the film to end on a fine note.Speaking of performances, Amitabh Bachchan as usual is excellent and suits the part. His dialogue-delivery is obviously commendable but he's very impressive in the scenes where he's simply observing and planning his next wise move. Emraan Hashmi is the surprise of the film. He has always been a great performer but here, he steals the show and stands up in front of the veteran actors. Also, he looks quite dashing. Annu Kapoor is dependable as always and its funny how he pronounces certain words and terms. Dhritiman Chatterjee has limited dialogues but leaves a mark. Raghubir Yadav has a unique look and adds to the madness, especially at the intermission point. Krystle Dsouza is another surprise of the film.On the whole, CHEHRE is a well-made film which rests on a unique plot and bravura performances."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10309902/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," A Decent Outing! ","Flipping through that many critical scrutinies, I was preparing myself for nothing but another disappointment. Following my two hours spent with this execution, now I can tell with much certainty that my presumption was only half right.To start with; the set-up, the all-around ambiance is relatively straightforward and explicit with their motivations and purposes. The creators knew what they needed to accomplish, and they successfully did so up until the third act's commencement. Unfortunately for them, thereupon, everything had gone downhill.The primary justification for its eventual downfall is directly correlated to the Script's inability to uphold the rhythm, the momentum it was building up to, until the finale begins to take place. Just goes to show, how much important it is to wrap up on a decisive note. The closure is as crucial as the initiation!Speaking of performances, those are nice. Nothing out of the ordinary, but each member of the cast did their job with utmost commitment and sincerity. Amongst them, needless to say; Mr. Bacchan stands out the most and on the other end, Emraan Hashmi again showcases his capability to be able to play all kinds of personalities.At the end of the day, their goals might have been naive, unearthing the loopholes of our country's judiciary or the protocols themselves; but the way all that has been dealt with, it just doesn't quite hit the mark. Don't get me wrong, the underlying subtext holds grave significance and mustn't be disregarded but the timing wasn't relevant nor the strategy the film had seemingly taken in regards to that particular aspect."

The film plays as a skit on the judicial system of the country with the retired judge, prosecutor and defense attorney living together in a bungalow and playing themselves in a game to execute the visitors of the bungalow as the criminals.Despite some suspense and excitement at instances, the film ends pointless and feels like a childish play. The twists are similar to a much unknown thriller "Zid" and Amitabh Bachchan shares a similar role from "Badla;'" but overall, "Chehre" ends in a tasteless note with an unlikeable and improbable plot, which won't retain long with the viewers.Rating: 1.5 stars out of 4."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10309902/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Everyone guilty must be punished by law ","Sameer Mehra (Emaran Hashmi) is caught in a blizzard while driving to Delhi from a resort in the hills and a fallen tree makes his onward journey impossible. A chance meeting with Mr. Paramjeet Singh Bhullar (Annu Kapoor) near the sight offers Sameer a night stay at the former's friend's house, much to the relief of Sameer. At the isolated bungalow in the hills, Sameer meets a group of four old, retired men who have had long careers in the field of law - Bhullar himself, Justice Jagdish Acharya (Dhritiman Chatterjee), Lateef Zaidi (Amitabh Bachchan) and Hariya (Raghuvir Yadav). The four men treat their young guest well, offer him drinks, dinner and comfort of home, and invite him to play a game of law with them, where Sameer has to play the accused and he can choose any crime that he would have committed.Confident and street smart as Sameer is, he claims that he has never committed a crime other than jumping signals on a few occasions and allows Lateef Zaidi to prosecute him on any crime he deems fit. The story starts taking a dramatic turn from here when Lateef realizes that Sameer is extremely ambitious and ruthless and his meteoric rise in his professional career must be due to some unscrupulous moves. Lateef plays the prosecutor, Bhullar the defence counsel, Acharya the judge and Hariya has a special task to execute. The game gradually reveals chunks in Sameer's armour and he is no longer confident and comfortable. And therefore way out until the game finishes."Chehre" is an interesting premise and a tactfully created plot. It's dialogue heavy and radically verbose, which aspect is both the film's merit and demerit. It's fast paced and exciting, albeit a little difficult to digest. But the concept of a courtroom outside of the established courts and the four old hands of law slowly breaking down Sameer's pride, confidence and gritty behaviour is interesting. The weak link in the endeavour is Amitabh Bachchan's rant on the precarious state of the legal cases and how the victims of heinous crimes fail to get justice - this aspect towards the end came up as irrelevant to the story, long and irritating, and honestly, brought the film to a screeching halt. The performances are all rock solid and Big B doesn't disappoint. Emaran Hashmi is credible and holds his ground when pitted against the stalwarts from the industry. "Chehre" is a good offbeat film as a one-time watch, but certainly not commercial success material."

He finds it amusing until they accuse him of killing his boss and taking his position in the agency. The trial begins and the unravelling of Sameer's case forms the story. Will he be convicted or acquitted ?Ranjit Kapoor's story is inspired from Swiss writer Friedrich Drrenmatt's acclaimed novel 'A Dangerous Game' and is very interesting and unique.

She is memorable in two scenes - one, where she almost stabs Emraan, and two, when Emraan asks her for the keys. Siddhant Kapoor (Joe) has no dialogues but speaks through his eyes. Samir Soni looks dull while Alexx O'Nell (Richard) gets no scope.Overall, Chehre is a engrossing movie with solid performances given by it's starcast."

They are Amitabh Bachchan ( Prosecutor), Annu Kapoor ( Defence lawyer) and Dhritiman Chatterjee( Judge). To help them in conducting the trial they have a pretty lass Rhea Chakravarty ( for providing lunch, dinner etc), a dumb, sober looking, axe wielding Siddhanth Kapoor ( for security etc) and a retired hangman, flute playing Raghuvir Yadav ready with a noose (just in case the convict is given death penalty).Emraan Hashmi plays a CEO of an advertising firm, who is stuck for the night and unwittingly agrees to play a game of standing trial for an imaginary crime of committing murder. This mock trial is conducted in an informal way over drinks and snacks. Here Amitabh using his powers of observation and deduction, ties up Emraan in knots by his questioning and tries to prove him guilty. There is considerable discussion on crime, punishment, right, wrong, morality etc etc.A sufficiently gripping film in the shape of a courtroom drama which is made eminently watchable due to the superior acting and absorbing dialogue. The lion's share of the scenes are taken up by Amitabh and Emraan who battle it out with interesting arguments. Amitabh repeats his roles of Badla and Pink with ease and elan as only he can. His long closing argument covering justice delivered in courts is however a bit heavy but his fans will love it. The film is directed well by Rumi Jafry and despite few technical flaws there is an air of authenticity. Also with stalwarts like Binod Pradhan ( Cinematography) and Resul Pookutty ( Sound) in charge, the film is embellished with good technical qualities."

Chief Justice ( Dhritiman Chatterjee). As the night progresses, we are introduced to the other characters, Amitabh Bachchan (Public Procecutor), Annu Kapoor (Defence Council), Raghuvir Yadav, Rhea Chakraborty and Siddhant Kapoor.To kill time, the stranger is invited to a game of a mock trial in which the court proceedings are held exactly per the Indian judicial system. However there is a sinister twist in the tale which forms the crux of the plot.Boasting of a stellar lead cast, Chehre does complete justice to a strong script with power-packed performances by each and every one of them. The film might seem slow to viewers who are used to watching thrillers that provide an instant adrenaline rush. Expect none of this in the film. This film is actually a slow burn with the eerie ambience of the isolated dim lit bungalow & the heavy snowstorm creating a perfect setting for an Agatha Christie like whodunnit.Pls do not go by the negative reviews posted online. This film, although slow, steadily leads you to a conclusion where you won't feel that you have wasted your time.

This film is a preachy, lethargic, crude and hollow thriller with neither style nor substance.I kept expecting something good to happen, and it never did. The plot is not good even for a short story, let alone a feature-length movie. The central mystery is really dull and it's presented in the most tedious way possible. Characters are uninteresting and the acting is flat. The monologue by Amit Ji is so preachy, stale and stupid that you really start to wonder about who wrote this crap. In my opinion, those self-righteous kooks, calling themselves protectors of law and justice, were equally at fault and should have been blamed for the casualty.This is waste of time and resources. There is no place for logic and reasoning in this film. The cinematography is good but visuals during the end sequences are reprehensible.The makers said during the release of the film that this is the film that is going to revive our theatres.

The first half is quite tensed and interesting. You already know from the trailer that Emraan must have committed a crime hence all this drama still you would like to know how things proceed and what exactly he did to deserve this fate. Tensed and interesting conversations , thanks to an earnest starcast makes the convos interesting.The 2nd half is where the film becomes ordinary. Emraan's past reminds of his regular cassanova films with betrayal. And that past too is not a good one. Hence the 2nd half is a miss!Amitabh, Emraan, Dhritiman, Anu and Raghubir...these 5 legends make sure that the present part is watchable and interesting! Rhea plays a rather mysterious complex character and she's decent (at the least i would say..ok).Overall, a film that you can give a shot at (if you are not one of those immature ssr nibba-nibbi fan base member).

We've seen most of this before in a long list of inspirational sports stories where the beleaguered, tough as nails coach comes in and unites a rag-tag team while teaching life lessons. However, with (2-time Oscar nominee) Michael Shannon cast as the coach, we know there will be at least one performance worth watching. The screenplay is from Vojin Gjaja and it's directed by Michael Mailer (son of 2-time Pulitzer Prize winning author, Norman Mailer).The film opens in May 1999 as a crew team finishes last in the Collegiate Rowing Championships. Inner-team bickering and animosity exists thanks to domineering Team Captain Alex (Alexander Ludwig, "Vikings"). The following year, the team is introduced to their new coach, Coach Murphy (Shannon). He has a different approach and he's focused on creating a team, rather than a few guys with oars. All we really learn about Murphy is that he's an alum and former rower for this same college, and an Army and Vietnam veteran who lost friends in the war, and carries that burden with him every day.Alex (Ludwig) is back for his senior year and his goal is to be chosen for the Olympics team ... a goal his over-bearing father (David James Elliott, "JAG") reminds him of every few minutes. The other two crew members who get significant screen time are John (Alex MacNicoll, ALL ROADS TO PEARLA, 2019) and newcomer Chris (Charles Melton, THE SUN IS ALSO A STAR, 2019). John is dating Alex's ex-girlfriend Sara (Ash Santos), while transfer student Chris is dealing with a recent tragedy, and also attracted to Sara's friend Nisha (Lilly Krug, EVERY BREATH YOU TAKE, 2021). And yes, at times the melodrama of these folks is just a bit too heavy-handed and soap opera-ish. Coach Murphy is clearly the most interesting character, yet the film spends the bulk of its time on the youngsters and their daily journey.One of the plusses here is that the sport at the center is rowing, which at least veers from the typical sports fare. But then we learn very little about the sport, other than it blisters your hands and causes your lungs to burn ... and there is "swing" which occurs when the team is in full sync. Mr. Shannon does as much with his underwritten role as possible; however, overall the movie is just a bit too generic with its final lesson of, "a loss is not the end." Should you have an interest in a true life rowing story, allow me to recommend the 2013 book, "The Boys in the Boat: Nine Americans and Their Epic Quest for Gold at the 1936 Olympics" by Daniel James Brown Opened October 29, 2021."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10327252/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," The Forever Purge ","The series began with a home invasion movie, sequel Anarchy expanded the universe to see outside, Election Year continued the franchise, and prequel The First Purge saw how it all started, and then this fifth movie came along. Basically, married migrant couple Juan (Tenoch Huerta) and Adela (Ana de la Reguera) illegally cross the border into Texas to escape from a Mexican drug cartel and build a new life. Eight years after Charlene Roan's presidential election, the New Founding Fathers of America (NFFA) have regained control of the U. S. government. The annual Purge and its original rules have been re-instituted, and Racial supremacy and nativism have surged nationwide. Ten months later, Juan has found work as a farmhand on the Tucker family ranch while Adela is working near Austin. On the eve of the next annual Purge, Juan and Adela join a migrant community behind a walled sanctuary with armed security to protect them. As the Purge begins, Adela witnesses a Purger group, who declare themselves to be a "Purge Purification Force" (PPF) that intend to kill those that they consider non-American. The group passes by without hostility, and the migrant community survives the Purge with no incidents. The following morning, Juan and Adela return to their jobs. But shortly after, Adela is attacked by two Purgers who have deliberately ignored the end of all legalised crime. She is rescued by her boss Darius Bryant (Sammi Rotibi) before both are arrested by police for killing their attackers. Meanwhile, Juan and fellow migrant co-worker T. T. (Alejandro Edda) discover that the Tucker family has been taken hostage by their farmhands, who are Purgers intending to take the ranch for themselves. Ranch owner Caleb Tucker (Will Patton) sacrifices himself and distracts the Purgers long enough for Juan and T. T. to rescue his son Dylan (Josh Lucas), Dylan's pregnant wife Cassie (Cassidy Freeman), and his sister Harper (Leven Rambin), who offer them a ride to search for Adela. Nationwide news struggles to understand why civilians are continuing to Purge after it has ended. The group rescue Adela and Darius after the police van carrying them is ambushed by more Purgers. Darius stays behind to search for his family while the others escape from Austin, which is seen burning. At a gas station, they hear news reports about chaos and destruction across all states of America, with local emergency services overwhelmed, it is being described as the "Forever Purge". To protect non-Purger civilians, Canada and Mexico have opened their borders for the next six hours, after which the borders will close, and entry will be denied. The group decide to escape across the Mexican border through El Paso. The NFFA has condemned the Forever Purge after their politicians and representatives are targeted, and martial law has been declared across the United States to try and contain the violence. In response, the Canadian and Mexican borders are closed earlier, leaving the group in a chaotic El Paso and those who trying to cross the borders vulnerable to the Purgers. Fighting through El Paso, Adela and Cassie are split from the group by military forces while Juan, T. T., Dylan, and Harper are captured by the PPF. The PPF leader, Elijah "Alpha" Hardin (Jeffrey Doornbos), offers Dylan and Harper a chance to live if they kill T. T. and Juan. When they refuse, the Purgers murder T. T. before the military intervenes, allowing the group to escape. However, the military base destroyed by more Purgers and they are forced to withdraw. Downtown, Adela protects Cassie from other Purgers, revealing that she and Juan trained with self-defence groups to fight against Mexican drug cartels before they arrived in the United States. The survivors all reunite at a hidden safe house run by a nearby Native American tribe. Their leader offers to transport everyone across the border as refugees. With the PPF in pursuit, Juan, Adela, and Dylan stay behind with other survivors to give the other refugees time to escape. Both groups engage in a gunfight until their ammo runs out and they fight with hand weapons. In the ensuing battle, the Purgers are killed, and Alpha takes Adela hostage. However, Juan and Dylan work together subdue and kill Alpha, saving Adela. The trio rejoin the others in a refugee camp on the other side of the Mexican border, where Cassie has given birth to her child, and Harper is with her. The group reunite to celebrate the child's birth. The NFFA is blamed for the prolonged violence as the entire country is seen burning and it has become a civil war. News reports indicate that more than two million Americans managed to cross the Canadian and Mexican borders as refugees while others rallied to fight back against the Forever Purgers. It is unclear what is going to happen next. Also starring Will Brittain as Kirk, Zahn McClarnon as Chiago and Cindy Robinson as Purge Voice. This fifth entry again makes the most of the outside destructive legal crime sprees, concentrating much more on masked racists who enjoy attacking people of Mexican descent, the survival of the fittest premise is still brutal, the amount of blood spill and explosions is fair, and the pace is reasonable, not that scary but a tense and exciting enough dystopian action horror thriller. Worth watching!"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10327252/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," I liked it! ","Directed by Everardo Gout and written by series creator James DeMonaco, this is yet another example of "the last Purge" before they announce another sequel. That said, this series has gone from middling to decent to actual pretty good to middling all over again, so I was happy that this pushes the Purge in a new direction: once the killing starts, it won't stop. Sure, the series has gotten pretty heavy handed, but if the last few years have taught us anything, it's that the Purge is closer than ever before.These films always get laughed at for the way they handle social issues and then they make over $52.8 million worldwide over its $18 million budget.Eight years after Charlene Roan's presidential election -- The Purge: Election Year -- the New Founding Fathers of America have regained control of the U. S. government and have re-instituted the Purge. Racism has gotten out of control and this years Purge seems like it will cause more damage than anyone can imagine.I mean, you can totally see how they tore this from the headlines. That's kind of why I have a soft spot for these movies, which feel like the last gasp of the exploitation movies that we love that would stare a cynical eye on what was really happening and figure out how to make some money off of it.Despite all of the film's main characters surviving the Purge, the next day the killing continues thanks to a faction called the Forever Purgers, who have decided to turn the tables on the rich and show them what it feels like to be undervalued.It's easy to be snide and think these films are a waste of time, but for some reason, I've found something to enjoy in every film after the first one. I'm really looking forward to Frank Grillo's character Leo Barnes coming back in the next film, as his journey between The Purge: Anarchy and The Purge: Election Year made for a great story."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10327252/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Violent but pointless franchise churner... ","It's often said that the best bits of a bad film are in the trail - well, here that is disappointingly true - and the film offers little more to pad out the remaining 100 minutes than many of us will have seen in the run up to this release. There is little, if any, jeopardy to augment a frankly preposterous plot line that sees lawlessness descend on communities across the USA. The only hope for survival would appear to be a desperate bid to get to Mexico where the border is to remain open for six hours whilst Donald waits for the cement on his new wall to dry. After about half an hour I began to feel sorry for poor old Josh Lucas - is this what he has been reduced to, now? The film does have high production values - it is well put together, but the story and acting leave so much to be desired as to render the whole thing little better than a time killer with an ending that is equally flat. I saw it at a cinema, but I can't really recommend anyone pays money to see this - it will end up on a streaming service soon enough and that's, ultimately, where it belongs.."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10327252/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," Not bad. Tried too hard. ","Not bad, while message heavy I think that wad kind of the point. The acting was decent and the main cast had good chemistry. For 'the purge' it lacked the gritty fighting I would have expected. Storyline was pretty basic and had a good but expected ending."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10327252/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," I don't like the Orange Baby either, but don't overdo it ","The Purge is a dusk-to-dawn suspension of all laws, including murder, the idea being it allows society's antisocial elements to get rid of it all in one burst of violent anarchy once a year, the rest of the year being crime-free. Film 1 was a decent urban pranoia horror thriller. Film 2 was an entirely seperate story set during the purge. Film 3 had the pro-Purge political party (the NFFA) trying to kill the anti-Purge political figurehead, and film 4 was a prequel, setting up the first Purge trial run on Staten Island.Now comes film 5. After 2 presidential terms without the Purge, the NFFA is in power and has reinstated it. But, in the morning, after the all-clear has sounded, a large and organised group determines that the Purge will continue until the country has been purified. A small group of people try to cross the Mexican border to safety.The Purge is a decent idea, with plenty of potential for action, suspense, jeopardy, and human interest. It is also a vehicle with scope for some social and political comment. Suspension of disbelief is crucial for movies, and who would believe a USA where people would vote to introduce a regime which was based on malice, hate and violence? Especially when those people subsequently come up with an organised violent overturning of the rule of law? Well, real life has helped with suspension of disbelief in that regard. But...I'm not overburdened with perception. I don't easily spot subtexts and subtleties, but I managed to spot the political points made here. It was hard not to since it was bludgeoned home with a sledgehammer. I'm sympathetic to the points made but, dear heavens, you're not doing yourselves any favours when your issues are drawn in black and white. Goodies and baddies, yes, but the issues should be more relatable in general terms if you want the audience on board.This was more propaganda than entertainment."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10327252/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","2"," Crude Stereotyping ","Nothing creative just crude excessive stereotyping & clichs on human behavior. Very simplistic political categorizing. (Must be the Trump influence.) Americans are more divisive than ever & the ones with the bigger guns are on the rampage. Predictable who lives, who dies. Humorously, Mexico is now the destination for freedom. The usual cheap artificial looking evenly spaced burning cars/trash along with nicely placed bodies on the streets to denote rampaging killers."

I'm pretty sure it's the most violent installment, quite disturbing, and I absolutely love the masks/makeup. Josh Lucas did so great, refreshing to see him in a more action based roll most anything else wasn't as much. The Purge movies tend to get a lot of hate and I'd highly recommend this one! I really like the writing and producers as well."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10327252/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," Similar to all the previous movies of "The Purge"... ",""The Forever Purge" is an Action - Horror movie and the fifth movie of "The Purge" franchise in which we watch another annual purge happening but this time it does not stop after twelve hours but continues and seems that will never end.I did not have high expectations from this movie because I had watched all the previous movies of this franchise and the plot is more or less the same in all those movies. The direction which was made by Everardo Gout it was good and he presented the main characters in a nice and simple way while he focused not only on the purge but also on the back stories of his characters. The interpretations of Tenoch Huerta who played as Juan, Josh Lucas who played as Dylan Tucker, Ana de la Reguera who played as Adela and Leven Rambin who played as Harper Tucker were good for a movie like this. Lastly, I have to say that "The Forever Purge" is another similar purge movie of the franchise without adding anything new so, if you have already watched the previous I do not suggest you to watch it and spend your time on it."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10327252/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Mindless action sequel that will entertain with not much of a story. ","4 out of 5 stars.The Forever Purge is a good action horror dystopian film about a family lead by Josh Lucas. And a mexican couple Tenoch Huerta and Ana de la Reguera. Who get through the night of the purge. Only after a lot of purge supporters decides to continue to cause mayhem and kill after the law has been lifted. While the family are trying to find a safe haven. Which U. S. is falling in turmoil with a forever purge is continuing. They try to escape the country to escape from the mayhem.I always find The Purge films to be entertaining. They are not the best but worth sitting through for the thrills and action. The Forever Purge is a better sequel than the last few movies. And the film does seem to be the last one in the series.The film does have a lot of thrills and action that would make this worth watching. With the family escaping from a lot of maniacs while running into a war torn town with people fighting and killing each other. And the military failing to contain the chaos.The cast ensemble is good. Josh Lucas did good playing a character that has issue with working aside with Juan (Tenoch Huerta). While his wife and sister are treating him and his wife like family. Ana de la Reguera did a great job in the leading role too.The film does cross a social theme with how mexicans are escaping there country cause of the corrupt system and cartel. Like Adela (Ana de la Reguera) leaving the country to start a new safe life. Only to face the purge in U. S. which is no different than Mexico.The plot is decent as it is undershadowed with the country falling apart cause of the purge.The Newton Brothers music score was also decent. The action is plenty and entertaining. It is a worthwhile sequel."

What is wrong with all of you haters? Stop dissecting movies based on your opinions or beliefs, give your heads a shake, and sit back and enjoy the ride smh. All these 1's and 2's are ridiculously undeserving.This Purge is my favorite of the entire series. Beautifully shot and directed by Everardo Gout. Outstanding cinematography and score. Perfectly paced in its 103 min runtime. Non-stop suspense, action and thrills. I'll even go as far and say this was way more entertaining than F9. It was such a creative story - I didn't think there was any other twist they could add to the franchise that would "wow" the fans, but this one was it. DeMonaco nailed this story. Casting and performances were excellent and convincing. I can't wait for the next installment.I'd watch this film again and recommend everyone watches this with agendas aside. It's an all-around great film you'll be on the edge of your seat through-out, with actual unexpected scares and just the right amount of gore. It's a well deserved 9/10 from me."

I stood up for the last film because I felt with (First Purge) they were reflecting on life as we know it, but in a subtle way.In this film it literally has the Trump 'wall'. The nuance is gone.Degenerates into redneck v Mexican....simply not good enough for Purge.With imagination there is plenty to explore so hopefully any future instalments. Dont become Rambo 5."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10327252/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," The Searchers ","I've not seen a Purge film before this one, but I was aware of the premise. So with no prior feelings about the series either way, I can say that I thought this was passable, but with an inconsistent story that threatens to derail it at almost any moment.In Texas, close to the border with Mexico, Adela (Ana De La Reguera) and her husband Juan (Tenoch Huerta) are living the American dream. The Tuckers, a rich white family, that employ a number of migrant workers, including Juan, prepares for the return of The Purge, following its reinstatement as an American holiday. Though they all survive the night unharmed, the following morning an organised group of the disenfranchised and prejudiced keep the Purge going and escalate to a full race war.So.. I thought that, at least the first one in the series, was a horror film and I was expecting a bit more of that for this, but really, it's an action film, particularly the longer the film goes on. There are some scenes in he first quarter that play a bit more horror influenced, but once it's clear that the purge is going to continue then it's mostly guns and explosions until the conclusion. I'm not specifically criticising the film for that, but it does move it into a particularly crowded field.What I will criticise it for though is for its unfocused plot. There are ideas introduced and not fully explored throughout. The principle one perhaps being that Dylan, the Tuckers remaining male character, played by Josh Lucas, has some racism issues of his own that are never really confronted. His, "I don't think I'm better, but we should all stick to our own" line is the nearest it comes, terrible message as though that is. I'd assumed at some point he'd have to make a deliberate choice which path to take, but it never really happens. It doesn't address how the organised militia group, which are constantly spouting rhetoric about cleansing America of its parasites, ties in with the group that attack the Tuckers initially, are led by an immigrant. The plot keeps changing the characters goals, which is fine but then seems to realise that the ending needs more Oomph so introduces a slightly ridiculous "final boss" type character about twenty minutes before the end.I didn't hate it, it's not exactly subtle with its politics but I'm fine with that, but in the end it's a shallow action movie, lacking in invention or ideas that would escalate it any higher."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10327252/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," The (unintended) timing of this film couldn't be better, making for relevant viewing ","As "The Forever Purge" (2021 release; 103 min.), we see a Mexican couple, Juan and Adela, crossing into the US illegally. We then go to "Ten Months Later", when it's only one day until the annual Purge. Juan works on a big Texas ranch, and there are tensions between the ranch owners and the hired hands (not just Juan). The 12 hr. Purge comes and goes without much of anything happening, but then the shocker comes: "white trash" refuses to end the Purge, making it into a Forever Purge, with the goal of "purifying" the country of all non-Americans, and taking over the business from the filthy rich, like Texas ranch owners...Couple of comments: the is the fifth Purge movie, and a direct sequel to the 2016 "Purge: Election Year" one. This movie was mostly written and filmed in 2019 (with an original intended release for Summer, 2020). In other words, way before the Jan 6, 2021 insurrection by the Trump supporters, who would indeed love nothing better than to "purify" the US of all immigrants (both legal and illegal) and grab ownership of businesses. This film pretty much shows us what would happen if the Jan 6 insurrection wasn't just one city, but playing out all over the country. It is absolutely uncanny. So what does indeed happen in the film? I'm sorry but I'm not going to spoil it, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out. As for the technical side of things, the movie is on par with previous Purge films. In other words: this isn't going to win any Oscar nominations. But I quite liked it, and again, the timing of this film's release couldn't be better, a mere six months after the insurrection of the US Capitol, as if the film makers rush released it to cash in on it (when in fact this should've been released a year ago but obviously COVID-19 had other plans). This makes "The Forever Purge" quite a political film, again unintended. I suspect that Trump supporters will not be a fan of this film, given that their ilk on the big screen don't come out looking very well in all this... Last but not least: the film's score is courtesy of the Newton Brothers, who by complete coincidence also scored the movie I saw 2 day ago, "The God Committee"."The Forever Purge" opened wide in theaters this July 4 weekend. The Tuesday evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended okay (about 25, from a quick count I did). If you are a fan of the Purge franchise, or would like to get a sense what a nationwide insurrection by white trash might look like, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray."

Like the 4th of July but instead of barbecuing, we can commit any crime we want, but I noticed none of these Purge movies has ever been about that one guy who just wants a new TV set. You have to figure there is a large community of people who just plane to steel a million dollars from the bank on the night of the Purge but I'm sure those people got killed by I bunch of righteously wrapped freaks who think steeling is wrong.This Purge is about those wrapped freaks organizing themselves and deciding they never one this night to end. Taking place in Texas close to the broader of Mexico, the Purge centers around a Mexican Cowboy working for a rich boy who don't believe in Mexican Cowboys as he and his wife, a woman who believes in the idea of America, gets to..." celebrate" their first Purge.The purge was never a horror movie technically but it does have all the horror elements, as regular citizens become Jason and Freddy showing off their worse for one night reflecting on the type of person you really are.The Forever Purge is a good movie and the Purge altogether is a good franchise. It works simple because of a vague belief that if we did allow this to happen this is exactly how it would go down."

Terrible characters. The characters in this movie are incredibly bland and it kills everything else the movie tries to do. It's impossible to care about them or their fates. This movie has other problems for sure, but they all stem from this.'The Purge' series has been a rocky ride. It started off okay, but also extremely misusing of the concept in the original 2013 film. Then the next two were great. They explored all the possibilities that come along with this inventive concept. Then the last two have just fallen apart. They need to take note of what made the second one especially so interesting. Get creative and think of all the potential there is.This one just didn't feel like there were any stakes. The whole thing is based around the survival of the characters, but they're hard to care for. There is no creativity in any of the kills or events. It is just people mindlessly attacking each other. The film feels like it drags on forever. This is the worst entry in the series yet and a major let down."

After being saved by the Hispanics they hate, they'll have to work together to survive. This movie is directed by Everardo Gout (Luke Cage) and stars Ana de la Reguera (Narcos), Josh Lucas (Ford vs Ferrari), Tenoch Huerta (Spectre) and Leven Rambin (The Hunger Games). This storyline actually had a good setup, primary plot and the Hispanics in this movie were absolutely awesome delivering their characters and storyline. Lucas played his part perfectly as well. I also adored the backdrops, background events, costumes and masks. Unfortunately there's zero gore in this film. Almost every kill is done with a gun and someone getting shot. There are some intense scenes but very few good kill scenes which causes this movie to fall flat. This is still worth a viewing but it isn't as good as it should be. I'd score this a 6/10."

The Forver Purge truly delivers in a bold exasperating fashion . Buckle -up !The Purge movies have always done something right as the casting is usually solid, with interesting choices for leading roles. It's effectively disturbing at times, and much of that is simply because the main characters are all well cast and mostly sympathetic.The Forever Purge, DeMonaco has taken the gloves off. This is a brutal, unflinching violent action crime thriller with plenty of gore for the horror gore -hound .The production value is through the roof . Incredible set pieces with an array of mayhem , destruction and plenty of pyrotechnics . I very much enjoyed the nod to the Mad Max road warrior segments of the film .The Purge franchise has always been an intriguing one. The series has explored several hot-button topics. The Forever Purge creates an interesting-looking feature. And the director certainly shows a bit of skill when bringing a little tension into the mix. A solid cast and intense action sequences, combined with DeMonaco's takedown of white supremacists, make this fast-paced entry in The Purge franchise one of its best. 8/10."

","I love The Purge films & consider "Anarchy" as the best of the franchise....until i saw "Forever Purge" which i totally enjoyed as a throwback to 70's style gritty & dusty Thriller's because for some reason this Purge really had that old school 70's feel. There's a modern western feel & look & i loved it.Maybe it was the sun-baked setting of Texas & Mexico or simply the Cowboy way the characters dress that made me think of those dusty road movies of the 1970's such as "Smokey & the Bandit" & "Mad Max" &"The Hills Have Eyes" & "The Gauntlet" for example. There's definitely an old fashioned flavour to this film & i dug it.The themes of Wealth, poor, race & violence are all extremely relevant especially with the scary mess that is America & of course it's always going to be relevant but especially so for the last few years with Trumps America & the Nightmare that the country has become.Anyway the film as a film is good exciting & suspenseful fun with a good cast of characters that you like & want to survive. Josh Lucas was decent & i haven't really seen him in anything for ages!!! I thought he disappeared or something but he is here & is decent but the best characters are the two main Mexican actors who give the best performances. Veteran actor Will Patton is good too in a small role but an effect role. Will Patton is probably known as a "Character Actor" as he's in lots of films but usually isn't the lead role but anyway an actor is an actor & the veteran, in his 60's now, is a great actor who has Starred in many films such as The Fourth Kind, The Punisher, Halloween & Halloween Kills, Armageddon, The Mothman Prophecies & tons more!!! The southern accent & average joe quality he has is put to good use here as the old Cowboy father of Josh Lucas's character & gives a solid performance for his screen time.Here the purge boils over to the next day & the savage violence is a shocking sight to see it happening during the beautiful sunny daytime & that makes the atmosphere very scary & intense.The cinematography is excellent. The score is great.I liked this new approach to the franchise by expanding the Purge world by making the daytime chaos & showing how the purge will never end.A nice mix of characters & with a strong look at what it means to be an "American" & to simply be a good person no matter the colour of your skin or where you come from. I'm sure there's tons of subtext throughout the movie but to put politics aside, it's an exciting action-packed Thriller that is actually pretty scary at times.I think i liked this Purge best so far."

It's a new film so I like it to go in a different direction, nowadays we have everyone being writers and directors they judge a film based on their thoughts of what it should be and how it should end up rather than watching it based on it's on merit!! I think it's a 6.5 but kicked it to 9 for all the political morons who judged it on their views. The action scenes were excellent, the story was a 5 but the action and great cast kick up up a notch or 2. The lead actress is the next action star , And Josh Lucas is ALWAYS phenomenal!!"

I think the only redeemable thing is photography, which even plays with colors a bit, but only in the first half of the film. I feel like they used the same formula that we had already seen in "Treintona, Soltera y Fantstica", that in the end because of everything that happens the protagonist goes down the drain and ends up doing something without a prior argument.A waste of time without a soul."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10329614/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Of course I liked it... ","Obviously, we're kind of invested in video nasties, what with our deep dives into sections 1, 2 and 3 of the films that were criticized for their violent content by the UK press and various organizations such as the National Viewers' and Listeners' Association.Thanks to a loophole, these films did not have to pass through the British Board of Film Classification. Soon could rent films that could never have made it into British theaters. Obviously, guardians of decency and morality soon lost their minds. It's kind of hard to put this into a U. S. frame of mind. Sure, we had the PMRC, but we didn't grow up in Thatcher's England.Yet nearly forty years later, the lure of video nasties still gets our collective lizard brain excited. We live in a place where you can now just load up something like Anthropophagous on a streaming service, but at one point, it wasn't just hard to find that movie. According to the Video Recordings Act 1984, all video releases required BBFC certification, along with a stricter code of censorship on home video than it did for actual films. If caught renting or selling these movies, authorities could use the Obscene Publications Act 1959 to levy fines, potential jail sentences and even close down businesses.All we got were stickers on our albums and some scattered record burnings. Nothing like the outright panic that occurred in the UK.This is the world that Censor takes place in.Enid is a video censor (Niamh Algar) who approves a movie* that a killer claims inspired him to devour his wife's face. Her notoriety leads to a producer named Doug Smart (Michael Smiley) to personally ask for her to censor his newest film, Don't Go in the Church. He's also attracted to the woman he sees hidden behind her thick glasses and severe lack of fashion, saying that she should be in one of his movies.Enid replies, "I don't think I like the idea of being raped and cut into pieces on screen."The shady producer shoots back, "The public would love it."As she continually watches the film in an attempt to slice its most worrisome moments - Enid is fastidious in her job, unlike many of her co-workers - she is reminded of her sister Nina, who disappeared when she was only seven years old. She becomes convinced that the actress Alice Lee (Sophia La Porta) is her missing sibling who has been forced to appear in these increasingly violent films.With her parents asking her to move on, Enid has no choice but to use the attraction that the producer has for her and follow him home. He thinks he's getting a chance to sleep with her. She wants more information on Alice Lee's next movie with director Frederick North (Adrian Schiller). As he attempts to seduce her, she pushes him away, causing an accident where he's violently impaled on one of his awards. At this point, reality and dreams start to mesh, brought together with the lines of tracking and fuzz that VHS movies once awarded us with.This moves Enid literally into the woods, seeking out the set and directed North, who confesses that all that he knows is that his movie was based on a true story. He casts her in the film without knowing that our protagonist has completely dissociated herself from reality and has the mission to rescue her sister and thereby end the blight of the video nasties.Director and co-writer** Prano Bailey-Bond explored similar territory in her 2015 short Nasty, a film in which a young boy searches for his missing father by watching the lost man's collection of video nasties. For a first feature, she does an admirable job of keeping a consistent tone of dread and nastiness; this would fit somewhat into the giallo subgenre of "woman slowly losing her mind in an attempt to come to grips with her past," which may be the longest name of a sub-genre ever.Unlike movies set in the 80s that keep things strictly neon, production designer Paulina Rzeszowska and director Bailey-Bond strove to keep things within the gray world - until we enter the videodrome, as it were - of Thatcher. Once those films start to play, they feel real, as the goal was that each fake movie had to have its own storyline, even if we don't see them play out in Censor. What we end up with is a sinister Wizard of Oz, where the escape to fantasy looks filled with the colors of Bava and the soft darkness of Eurohorror.The film may have an ending you see coming from the beginning, but it's still a pretty entertaining and tight affair. And hey - anyone making horror movies that are just 82 minutes long understands exactly one very important and lost rule of how the genre should play.You may be upset with the fact that your beloved video nasties will get a new audience of people who may not understand why they're important to you. Perhaps you will get the opportunity to explain it to them and open the gates somewhat. Or you can always avoid it, wait for this to pass over and content yourself by watching Bloody Moon for the twentieth time.As for me, I hope that someday, Bailey-Bond makes a full version of Don't Go Into the Woods, because it looks like the kind of film that I absolutely love.*It's Deranged, the real 1974 movie directed by Alan Ormsby and Jeff Gillen. I kind of love how Censor balances films created within its universe with actual movies.**Co-writer Anthony Fletcher also worked on both of these films."

Long live the "Video Nasties" ","Enid Baines, an extremely introvert and inconspicuous woman in her late twenties, works for the British Board of Film Censors during the early 1980s; - around the time of the infamous "video nasties". She has the reputation of being strict and prudish, but she also carries with her the unprocessed childhood trauma of when her sister Nina disappeared in the woods although Enid was supposed to be looking after her. During the censor screening of a horror film named "Don't go in the Church" - got to love the title -, Enid sees scarily accurate details from the day of Nina's disappearance, and even recognizes her now adult sister in the B-movie lead actress Alice Lee. Enid goes on a private quest to discover whether or not the mysterious director Frederick North kidnapped her sister.Being an obsessive horror fanatic, with a particular fondness for extreme stuff from the 70s and 80s, I was obviously very attracted by the thematic. My movie-buddies and me have seen all titles on the legendary "video nasty" list, and it was definitely interesting to see an actual genre film truthfully incorporating the modus operandi, parameters, internal debates and decisions of the censorship commission. And, of course, writer/director Prano Bailey-Bond simply must underline the main moral a couple of times, namely "NO to censorship". Movies don't provoke violence, people with unsane minds commit violence. It's a moral I support for a full 100%, evidently!The mystery/thriller plot itself is also better than expected, with some compelling sequences and a forceful performance by Niamh Algar. Enid's descent into paranoia is far from plausible, but there's pitch-black humor and a bit of nice gore.Tip for fellow video-nasty fanatics: spot all the little references, clips and homages to contemporary horror classics and guess the titles!"

Will Hayes is likely the only film censor most movie buffs can name, and it's been more than ninety years since the "Hays Code" first went into effect. Despite the relative obscurity of the profession, the first feature film from Prano Bailey-Bond, places censor Enid Baines (Niamh Algar, WRATH OF MAN, 2021) at the forefront of a prime midnight movie ... a horror film about horror films. Ms. Bailey-Bond has adapted her own short film NASTY (2015) with the help of co-writer Anthony Fletcher, and for the most part, the changes work quite well.The story is set in 1985 when "video nasties", the U. K. label for slasher films, were at the peak of their popularity thanks to the convenience of VHS tapes. Many argued these films, typically independent and low budget productions, were influential in allowing sadistic violence to seep into society. As a film censor, Enid (an excellent Algar), who dresses and carries herself like a 1950's librarian, is responsible for making sure the fictional violence on screen doesn't cross the line of what's acceptable and clearly fictional. Enid takes her job extremely seriously and is annoyed when people mistakenly assume she is in "entertainment". For Enid, it's all about protecting the public.Bailey-Bond jams a lot into 84 minutes ... much more than most horror films attempt. Enid's backstory, and really the driving force for the film, involves her sister's disappearance when they were kids. It remains an unsolved mystery, and Enid often suffers flashbacks and dream sequences - none more vivid than when one of the movies she's watching triggers hope of resolution and a mash-up of fiction and reality. This kicks the movie into a different gear, as we are no longer caught up in Enid's stress censoring movies, but rather in her desperate search to solve the mystery of her sister.Multiple sub-plots (or at least story lines) exist, including Enid's strained relationship with her parents - with an underlying theme of blame - and a real world tragic event that may implicate Enid's work. At play throughout is the existence of violence against women, and Michael Smiley (FREE FIRE, 2016) portrays a sleazy producer whose actions are likely similar to many in the mid-80's. Much of the third act is surreal as Enid crosses over onto the set of director Frederick North's (Adrian Schiller) latest movie after she sees a possible connection to her sister in North's previous film "Don't Go in the Church". The production design by Paulina Rzeszowska (SAINT MAUD) and the cinematography of Annika Summerston are noteworthy. With Enid wielding both a pen and an axe, the film is a bit deranged and disorienting, but a nice fit for the midnight movie crowd.In theaters June 11, 2021."

Led by an outstanding performance from its leading lady and serving as an honest tribute to B-movies of the video nasty era, the film is an impressive first outing for its debutant director.Co-written & directed by Prano Bailey-Bond, the film strongly echoes the works of Argento, Fulci & Cronenberg with its splendid use of colour, style & mood. Those films within the film pay homage to the low-budget horror & exploitation films of the 1980s while its own plot is missing chunks of flesh. It also gives away the ending rather early with hints of a dark past concerning our protagonist but remains gripping.The varying formats & different gauge it utilises do add a disorienting quality to the narrative in addition to reflecting the main character's deteriorating state of mind. The violence & gore effects have a retro feel to them. The period setting is recreated with finesse. But what keeps our interest alive from start to finish is Niamh Algar's deft understanding & brilliant showcase of her character, and she renders her role with steely confidence.Overall, Censor marks a promising start to Prano Bailey-Bond's filmmaking endeavours and is expertly steered by Niamh Algar's excellent act. Its stylistic choices & gradually unraveling atmosphere do leave a solid impression but the script nonetheless required more fine-tuning to truly nail the brief. On the visual front however, it is sophisticated work all the way through and for a first time effort, it sure is commendable. Definitely worth a shot."

Lots & lots of screen time filled with static & boring, walking down semi-lit hallways, sitting in a small room reviewing snippets of old horror films on an old TV; driving a car; not clear flashbacks. Acting felt staged, artificial.

It's such an intriguing idea for a movie. Sadly, as is usually the case, the reality isn't quite as entertaining as the concept. The movie started off well and actually had a really gripping and clever set-up period. But as the film went on it chose to go further and further down the strange and bizarre route and it just lost me.This is a debut effort for filmmaker Prano Bailey-Bond. He shows some real promise. Even though I didn't love the direction the film chose to go in, the writing was still very sound. At least he picked a route and went with it convincingly. Usually the dialogue in these low-budget, debut films is noticeably bad, but here it was well above average I would to say. It was interesting and felt natural. There's certainly some talent behind the scenes here.The film is short at only 84 minutes and it moves a long at a reasonable pace, so you are never caught checking your watch. There's enough to like here for people to enjoy, and it's possible some people will prefer the plot-path the film decided to go down more than I did. I will give this one a light recommendation. It might just pleasantly surprise you."

TV and radio talking heads including Mary Whitehouse expound on the filth and depravity being allowed in the videos. Indeed the eponymous censor Enid (Niamh Algar) is caught up in it as a film she approved (with cuts) is blamed for real life mass murder. Enid is actually conservative in her approach while one of her colleagues likens eye-gouging in the films to that of Gloucester in King Lear. When Enid views one film it reminds her of a childhood trauma when her sister disappeared; viewing another by the same director she is certain her sister is the actress.

Woods are used to good effect, being creepy and threatening in dreams, visions, films and at night on a film set. Only in a fantasy sequence do trees bring any joy. Extreme violence but Enid's inner turmoils provide much of the horror in Censor. Directed/Co-Written by Prano Bailey-Bond. 8/10."

The film takes the slow burn approach, which is interesting considering the very short runtime. It isn't perfect but it's a very promising directorial debut."

I especially liked the 80's Britain backdrop with the presence of the video nasties being so prevalent. I liked the main character, Enid, and I thought she had an interesting enough journey. But what made this movie for me was where it ended up going. Maybe other viewers were let down, but I thought the ending was memorable. There is some imagery in there that will stay with me. Not scary, just well done."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10329614/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," Excellent, twisted psychological horror ","It's delightfully cheeky, constructing a horror film with a concentration on video nasties as subject matter, and a censor at that. I dare say the concept here, a psychological thriller, is quite the undertaking for a debut full-length film, so hats off to writer-director Prano Bailey-Bond for the effort. I like star Niamh Algar, the film immediately comes off as very well made, and one is readily curious where the story is going to go.'Censor' is strong in all technical considerations. Sound and image are pristine, with special attention rendered via stylized, pointed editing and effects depending on the nature of the perspective in a given scene. I appreciate composer Emilie Levienaise-Farrouch's score, characterized largely by ambient soundscapes that lend unease and tension to the picture. Set design and decoration is great, as are rounding details like props, blood effects, and hair, makeup, and costume design. Bailey-Bond has a wonderful sense for use of lighting, and composing swell shots, ensuring we get an eyeful of small details without making tightly-focused frames seem inorganic.Those critical small details include above all else the outstanding performance from Algar, for as much as there is a concrete narrative in 'Censor,' it's at least as true that the movie is essentially the journey of protagonist Enid. Though punctuated with acutely jarring moments, this is far and away a calculatingly subdued, low-key film, centered fixedly on the star - and she manages the part to great success. For all the terrible stress that Enid is under, from many sources, her roiling mental state portends a fracturing sense of what is or is not real. With that, the role requires tremendous nuance, range, and strength of personality. Algar inhabits the space with immense practiced skill, making the troubled censor seem as horrifically real as she could be. It's the sort of portrayal that one hopes will garner Algar much more of a spotlight, because she definitely deserves it.Superb as Bailey-Bond is as a director, the screenplay she co-wrote with Anthony Fletcher is just as marvelous. There's no specific weakness as I can see, and all aspects are written with care and precision. The character of Enid is gratifyingly complex, and only grows more so as the film runs on: 'Censor' is an exploration of her psyche, and it's an unexpected ride. The scene writing, focused always on Enid, at all times serves to accentuate a particular place on her path, but with such a delicate hand that the subtlety is easy to miss or misunderstand at first. And the overall narrative emphatically maintains a core thrust, and heads in a distinct direction, that I rather didn't anticipate - but I'm grateful for it. Because the end result is an exceptional, underhanded horror-thriller that actualizes the overarching disquieting atmosphere with a climax and finale that's inescapably riveting, and frankly awe-inspiring in its brilliance of writing and execution alike.I began watching with no especial foreknowledge or expectations, and at first honestly found myself put off by the tone and laid-back air that the feature affected. But that first impression was handily defied in little time at all as the story began to take shape. I could understand an argument that the constituent narrative elements don't necessarily all fit together with perfect cohesion, but the film works so well broadly, cementing the unsettling experience of Enid, that I can easily overlook perceived minor shortcomings. I'm so very pleased: for the stupendous way it depicts the protagonist's questionable mental constitution, 'Censor' is a devious, captivating portrait of a woman ill at ease and struggling to keep her wits about her. This is well worth seeking out to watch, recommended most of all for anyone who enjoys the quiet cunning of psychological horror.Well done!"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10329614/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Interesting Premise/Concept, but Falls Short with Focus ","This is a movie that I got turned on to thanks to going to the Gateway Film Center. I try not to watch trailers, but it is difficult when I go to the theater with Jaime. This is one that I caught part of and decided that I wanted to check it out. For date night, we decided to see this. Aside from a bit about the plot, I came in blind. The synopsis is after viewing a strangely familiar video nasty, Enid (Niamh Algar), a film censor, sets out to solve the past mystery of her sister's disappearance, embarking on a quest that dissolves the line between fiction and reality.Now this is an interesting movie here. It is taking place in the United Kingdom during the 'video nasties' era. I'm not going to delve too much into the history of this, but Enid Baines is one of the censors that would watch films and then report on what needed to be cut in order to make a certain rating or to be shown in the UK. She is known to be much harsher than some of her co-workers as well.Enid has an interesting past. She had a younger sister of Nina (Amelie Child Villiers) who disappeared when they were children. Enid is holding out hope that her sister is still out there. She gets some powerful news while out at dinner with her parents of June (Clare Holman) and George (Andrew Havill) that they're filing a death certificate so they can move on. They want Enid to move on as well. She doesn't take the information all that well.This news doesn't help as things take a turn at work. There is a man that killed his wife after watching a movie called Deranged. The accused doesn't remember doing what he did and is dubbed 'The Amnesia Killer'. Somehow, Enid's name was leaked to the press as the censor that saw a violent scene of eating a victim's face and she approved it. This causes outrage. It also causes the press to follow her, wanting a statement.As the stress mounts on Enid, she watches a movie at work called Don't Go in the Church. It was brought in by Doug Smart (Michael Smiley). He's a sleazy producer and the film is done by a notorious director by the name of Frederick North (Adrian Schiller). The movie really messes with Enid as the events in the beginning are like what happened to Nina before she disappeared. Enid tries to find out more about the director and this leads her to his most popular actress, Alice Lee (Sophia La Porta).Enid is plagued by nightmares of the Beastman (Guillaume Delaunay) who is in the movie she saw. She is also convinced that Alice is really her sister Nina and has been forced into acting. Much like the synopsis stated, the stress and pressure mounts which causes Enid to lose grip with reality. Can Enid figure out what is real and what is fantasy before it is too late?Now that is where I want to leave my recap of the movie. There are some interesting layers to this movie. This era in British film history of the 'video nasties' is where I want to start. I didn't learn about this until I got into podcasts. It is fascinating to me and part of the credit I need to give here is to Duncan with his podcast of Doing the Nasty. He has directed me to the documentary about this for a more in-depth look about this fascinating idea. There were politicians who were afraid that children, working class adults or even dogs could be affected by watching violent and filthy movies. I've ran into censorship of certain movies and video games that inconvenienced me growing up, but on the scale this was done is crazy. It is just interesting hearing their thoughts on some films and how strict they went with others that were overkill in my opinion. I do like that it feels like the writer and the director understand this era and bring that to the table.With that fleshed out, I like that the idea of why the 'video nasties' is explored. Some might think it is stating that watching too many horror films makes someone descend into madness. I don't think that is what they're getting at here. It feels to me it is stating that people who are susceptible to this shouldn't watch them. Enid is fine in the beginning. I believe the stress of the information given to her by her parents, seeing a horror movie that is eerily similar and she so badly wanting to find her sister causes her to fall apart like she does.This movie wouldn't work though without a good performance from Algar. I think she does well as giving us a baseline for the character of Enid. We don't need a lot, but we get enough of her before she starts to lose it. I think there are a lot of forces working against her. Her parents give the initial shock. Then it seems like there is a reporter with someone on the inside, which if I have to guess it would be Sanderson (Nicholas Burns) to leak information to the press. She so badly wants to find her sister and relieve the guilt for her disappearance just adds another element there. With each one of these, we see the character losing it even more and she did a great job. I'd say the rest of the cast rounded this out for what was needed as well.I do need to shift to some thing that I found as a negative. This is a really slow burn. Jaime actually didn't care for it due to how boring it was. That's not to say she thought the movie was bad. The investigation isn't as exciting as it could be. What they decided to focus on was more of the mental state of Enid and less of the investigation itself. I do think they could have balanced this a bit better in my opinion as well. The movie does culminate in a flurry, but it did feel a little bit of too little, too late for me.Then really the last things to go over would be the effects, cinematography and the soundtrack. For the former, it did look like they went practical. There aren't a lot of effects used and many of them we're seeing on television as characters are watching things. The blood looked good though and this aspect was well done. The same could be said for the cinematography. I think it does well giving us the feeling of what Enid is going through. There is some great editing during the conclusion that really worked for to show the duality of what Enid thinks is happening and closer to the truth. Then I'd say the soundtrack fit for what was needed.So then in conclusion here, I really liked some parts of this movie. It is interesting setting this in the UK during the 'video nasties' era and giving us a censor who due to her mental state shouldn't be watching the movies that she is. I think there is a really good idea and mystery here, but the movie just focuses on some things that weren't as interesting for me. Seeing the breakdown of Enid is good, especially with how well Algar plays the role. The effects that we got are solid, giving it a touch of the sleazy movies that this movie is referencing. I also like the effects and cinematography for the climax as well as the conclusion. It is interesting and disorienting. I can't recommend this movie to everyone. You really need to enjoy slow burn films and even then, I can see a lot of people not liking it. For me, this is just over average. If some things could be tweaked or added, it could have been much higher."

","Only heard about this when I was looking for films to see at my local Cinema & thought to give this a watch as it sounded like it would be good! How wrong was I!The film follows a woman named Enid working as a film censor at the BBFC in the early 1980's & finds herself becoming mentally unstable after she views a familiar Video Nasty & goes out to solve the past mystery of her sister's disappearance, that sees the line or fantasy & reality being severely blurred as she digs deeper & deeper!I found the film to start off with strong & promising! The setting of the 1980's, the brief clips of 80's horrors that I've seen & heard of along with the fictional film within a film film's based off of real life horrors was a nice touch! The theme on Violence In Cinema was interesting as well & a subject matter that I myself am clued up on & usually talk about!But the story & dragged out pacing made this film a bitter disappointment! Where to start? The story, I mean, while the premise is simple, the execution & twist make little to no sense at all! The story arcs seem to start & go nowhere with no follow up to them, which is what the viewer would expect, yet we don't get that. E.g. The man who killed his family after watching Deranged which was passed by the Censors in the film, we hear nothing about it afterwards! The Death of the producer at his home when Enid pushed him into the Horror Award on the table! It's like the film just jumps around & plods slowly & then repeats!The film goes in all kinds of rapid directions without any explanation & expects you to understand what is happening! The ending especially, what the hell was going on there!? I was expecting an ending to explain everything yet it just ends like that & you're left screaming "THAT IT!?", I mean come on! You're left with more questions than answers! What happened to Enid!? Did she get arrested!? Did she get caught? Did she get away!? Did she die!? What!? Nothing made sense! It's as if the Writer/Director gave up, but it's no wonder it was bad! Being it was written & directed by a woman that knows nothing about horrors!The film itself was just a slow bore with little to no action in it aside from the brief scenes of horror we get to see! Aside from that, the film was a plane crash at the end! Terrible! At 1 hour & 19 minutes, you'd think the film would be good, yet it feels longer at nearly 2 hours!Overall, the film starts of strong but loses it way VERY fast by the end!3/10."

Even her minor role in Guy Ritchie's Wrath Of Man offered more than this.Check out The Virtues, Calm With Horses, Deceit, Pure, The Bisexual, Motherfatherson. She is so much better in those."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10329614/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Prano Bailey-Bond's visual style is splendid; the plot feels half-baked! [+59%] ","Censor is set in the UK during the '80s video nasties era and primarily revolves around Enid (Niamh Algar), a video censor. Enid starts to connect the exploitation films she works on with her own tragedy (involving her sister who went missing), eventually unable to distinguish between reality and hallucination. The first act really caught my interest - co-writer/director Prano Bailey-Bond acknowledges the era for its crime boom (which was wildly attributed to the rise of violent, low-budget horror films), and recreates the appropriate aesthetics.The tone is seriously bleak and accentuated by the right colour grading. Seeing VHS tapes, VCRs, picture-tube TVs on one side and a deteriorating mind on the other - that's how I would sum it up. While Enid seeking closure regarding her sister is an intriguing direction that the makers went in, I'd have loved to see more meta-references to film-making and film-censoring in those times. That's what the first act, in fact, sets up. Enid's descent into mental chaos becomes the film's focus in the second act, and the meta elements only serve as background noise from that point on. The slick production aside, both the social commentary and the completion of Enid's character arc come off as relatively underdeveloped.The final act goes bonkers. I like how the skewed aspect ratio offers a different visual perspective. The way the Welsh director uses VHS fuzziness to enhance the horror quotient is also quite impressive. Now, whether the writers' decision to take the film in a 'psychologically affecting' route instead of the 'investigative mystery' route excites you (or not) will ultimately determine your amusement levels. I did like Censor to a fair extent, and will definitely be looking forward to the director's next."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10329614/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," You can't censor insanity ","It started out very intriguing but towards the end it felt like the script became ambiguous although there were many subplots in the beginning. However the main actor was amazing from the beginning to the end. The censor young woman was watching all those video nasties to decide if they're ok to be released or they should be banned or censored. After watching one of the movies, she noticed it's very similar to the missing of her little sister. Two girls in the woods going in the church and one of them attacked the other. Then she thought the actress is her missing sister. She's blaming herself like her parents for her little sister having gone missing so he went over to the house of the producer of that film and happened to kill him after he wanted to make out with her. She pushed him onto his prize and it got stuck in his mouth from his neck. Then she went to the set of the film where they shot the last film of that actress whom she thought she's her sister. She pretended to be an actor and met the director. It went really strange from here on. She improvised for the director and killed the beast man the actor because she thought he'd hurt her sister and killed the director by beheading him as well and chased the woman saying she's her sister but she was afraid and infuriated. And the movie ended with the two girls holding hands and Enid took her to their parents which all seemed to be the dream of Enid I guess because there was a glitch where her sister screamed for help for split second in between those very happy scenes. The media blamed her for inspiring the amnesiac killer for not banning a video nasty and she became the real video nasty antagonist in the end."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10329614/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","3"," No satire, no social commentary, no stance about censoring. Having a B-movie (framed) in a movie could have been interesting but was not ","Saw this at the Imagine filmfestival, usually in Amsterdam but now 100% online. The synopsis on the festival website was promising, but I missed satire, social commentary, and no stance about censorship. It seemed interesting to have a B-movie inside a (frame) movie, offering an opportunity to explore how far a director can go in realism to keep his audience interested. Similarly interesting could have been some attention for politics around censoring a movie, lobbying by film producers against cuts, selling uncensored movies "under the counter", and so on. We see vague hints touching these topics, but none of my expectations came through to merit more attention for this film. The only positive note that I can think of, is that I sat it out without being bored."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10329614/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Great horror homage to the halcyon days of the Video Nasties ","For me 'Censor' is a welcome return of a type of film I haven't seen in a cinema for years. It may not be a some big budget tent-pole movie but films like 'Censor' were made for the big screen.It's a homage to the olden days of horror, and takes a lot from the 1970s cinema and 1980s video horror movies, but really to me it seems to also pay heed to the horror movie golden age in the noughties, from Asian films such as Ringu.In my opinion, 'Censor' stands amongst the top echelon from films from those days. The days of The Wicker Man etc are long gone but that's not say they can't be revisited.We have a film that isn't really frightening, albeit does try some jump scares, but more a study into a descent into madness. A young lady who is a film censor during the heyday of the video nasties uproars in 1980s Britain, has a dark secret that comes to the fore due to film that she is reviewing.The film is a psychological tour (but not heavily) as we follow with our lead lady who becomes traumatised, but the question is whether it is her past or the movies that are inflicting the damage? The film is really agnostic over the whole debate on video nasties, but you will have a think to yourself on the related issues.I loved the film. It was a great trip down memory lane for those of us from those days. The video halcyon days are too often overshadowed by other eras or by mainstream hits like The Goonies, but the truth is that the era was very democratic and horror & violent movies had a field day. This film looks back on that era, and we will laugh at some of the fears & hysteria from the time.The lead (Niamh Algar) actress is superb, the pacing & direction is wonderful. The director uses an old school cinematography style that works wonders here, and I won't give away some wonderfully done shots which really adds to the creepiness.This film proves again that the best horror films are not necessarily the scariest (even The Exorcist isn't by far the scariest). This film isn't really that nasty, it's the underlying themes. This film is wonderful, and shows the UK can still make great horror films frugally.Really recommend you go watch this in the cinema."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10329614/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," Also baited, blah movie ","I was also baited by some early reviews. The main actress is good. But this is just a British B-movie with a 1970~80s setting. If you like campy films then it maybe for you."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10329614/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," I thought this was great: a genuinely novel story ","Positives: I often whinge on about there being no novelty in movies anymore, with everything being derivative of everything else. Well here's a case for the defence. There have been movies before about the mental effect of working in the horror movie business (Toby Jones in "Berberian Sound Studio" comes to mind). But none (as far as I'm aware) from the viewpoint of a film censor. This novelty gave the movie the scope to go in a number of different directions - including as a historical drama. But it focuses on a study of how loss and grief can suddenly emerge in dramatic ways even after many years. Director Prano Bailey-Bond co-wrote this and directs it with such verve that she is very much added to my "one to watch" list for writer-directors.Irish actress Niamh Algar is just brilliant here, reminiscent of Morfydd Clark's fantastic performance in "Saint Maud" (not the only parallel to be drawn in this review). The acting during the dramatic conclusion is utterly chilling.While the ending of the movie might be polarising, I loved it. No spoilers, but it's one of my favourite endings of any movie so far this year. It reminded me strongly of the ending of "Saint Maud".The editing is by Mark Towns (who also did "Saint Maud"). And it's bloody marvellous, particularly during that finale! While it doesn't shy away from showing some pretty horrible stuff, Towns shows much of this subliminally in the edit (shades of the "Psycho" shower scene). This probably helped with its certification (of which more later).The music by Emilie Levienaise-Farrouch is quirky and fitting for the movie. I loved the jaunty end-title music.Has one of the best impalings since Timothy Dalton fell on that model church spire in "Hot Fuzz"!Negatives: While Algar is utterly fabulous, I was less convinced by the acting of some of her fellow censors in the office. Some of this felt a bit wooden to me.Summary Thoughts on "Censor": The workings of the UK film censors have always fascinated me, and here's a novel insight into their work during a very difficult period in their history: the National Viewers and Listener's Association, headed by the fearsome Mary Whitehouse, was up in arms at the potential damage to people's (and particularly children's) mental wellbeing from the influx of "video nasties" arriving in homes on VHS tapes. The film needs to be applauded for coming up with such a novel storyline.What I found surprising (and ironic) is that this got away with only a "15" certificate. Editor Mark Towns suggested to me, in a private communication on Twitter, that the BBFC rated it thus due to the "context" in which the violence was set. But I remember the first 'X' film I saw. It was Brian De Palma's "The Fury", which (from memory) was purely rated as such for the final scene in which John Cassavetes's character explodes in a gory fountain. Judging from "Censor"'s "15" certificate, things have become significantly more permissive in recent years!(For the full graphical review check out onemannsmovies on the web, facebook and (for the video review) Tiktok.

J Abrams Super 8 also managed to do a fine job of being Goonies light but thoroughly entertaining but there have been many misses in this space also as films look to create their own world of mystery, suspense and fun with a focus on the child in all of us.One of the most blatantly Goonies inspired films I recall seeing (it even features 80's child star and Goonie member Ke Huy Quan in a supporting role!) , Netflix's latest family oriented original Finding 'Ohana wants badly to be the newest all-ages romp we all enjoy and features a set-up and location that seems tailor made for some fun and frenetic times but director Jude Weng's try hard and forced film fails to inspire much in the way of magic as its tiresome story, terrible scripting and string of poor performances halts any chances it may've had of being in the same class as the 80's classic.Set in the picturesque islands of Lost aka Hawaii, 'Ohana is a colorful and vibrant film in regards to its setting and locations but Weng's film that is centered around young New Yorker Pili and her families move back to their home state of Hawaii where they discover the meaning of family and life on a quest for lost treasure to help save the families property is rather forced and uninspiring even if the messages the film is portraying are all unquestionably good ones.Nothing in Weng's film feels overly original or inspired, jokes fall flat around bland characters and juvenile scripting and budget set pieces constantly rear their ugly heads throughout, meaning keen eyed older viewers will be having a tough time getting immersed in Pili's quest to strike it rich and learn the meaning of life with her siblings and friends.You can sense there is a really strong film somewhere in 'Ohana, the casting of native Hawaiians and the paradises jaw dropping surrounds gives the film a fresh vibe in certain aspects but nothing can excuse such poorly designed narrative movements, wooden acting and a lack of suspense or thrills, which ensures this wannabe family classic is one for the very young viewers only, not the child that lay inside us all.Final Say -A tough film to enjoy despite its good intentions, this latest Netflix original is far from being a modern day Goonies and will have most viewers rolling their eyes rather than captivated by a supposedly fun-filled adventure.1 1/2 broken phones out of 5."

It weirdly makes the movie into a paranormal type of a movie, which (to me, at least), makes it feels almost as a slight to the Hawaiian culture that it embodies.I imagine its about the same as the movie having angels, but it feels more like Egyptian mummies. But maybe we should be taking mummies more seriously, who knows.Great little family watch.

The mom, Leilani (Kelly Hu), doesn't get along with her family all that well. It's as if all these different generations are colliding, but through the unusual experiences and with help from new friends, they discover the greatest treasure - the love of family (ohana).The movie mixes fantasy and adventure, a little romance, humor and drama in a fun way. This story remind of Goonies and has some elements from the classic 80s films like Indiana Jones, but deals with contemporary subjects of identity and multi-cultural issues. The scenes were filmed on various locations on O'ahu, which gives the film a very authentic tone. The sightseers are beautiful and there is some lovely underwater photography. The story is entertaining and keeps you focused most of the time. Some visual effects and practical sets are not all that impressive, but the performances are very good and make you connect with the characters and what they are going through. Kea Peahu, who plays Pili in her film debut, is amazing in the leading role. I love the songs in the soundtrack and the way the music is incorporated into the storyline. I also love that the film reinforces the importance of a simple life; sometimes we focus on our dreams and goals; we forget about the beauty that is in front of us in our everyday life.The message of the film is that love of family is unconditional despite our differences.I give Finding 'Ohana 4 out of 5 starts and recommended for ages 5 to 18, plus adults.

","Finding OhanaThis was aimed at a very young audience, I would guess no older than 14. There were very few good things, like the scenery or the sea, the rest was largely bad on many levels.For instance the mother was just nasty to everyone, had I been her child I would have divorced her. There was an equally nasty feminist/female empowerment thread that I found distasteful where all the men were portrayed as idiots in comparison to their female counterparts. It was grossly imbalanced.Believe it or not one character said "I am frightened to go to New York because it might make me uncomfortable with who I am!" What snowflake mind did that come from, what culture is so fragile that a trip to McDonald's threatens it.Ordinarily I would have given this a 5 but I sense a political brainwashing agenda so it's a 4 out of 10, meaning steer clear."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10332588/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," A mixture of treasure hunting adventure and family melodrama that stumbles at first but finds its footing as it goes on ","Pili (Kea Peahu) has her sights set on attending a Geocaching camp, but after her grandfather (Branscombe Richmond) has a heart attack, Pili must forfeit her prize and go to Hawaii with her mother Leilani (Kelly Hu) and brother Ioane (Alex Aiono). Once there Pili finds a journal among her grandfather's possessions that tells of a group of privateers who hid a cache of gold on the island and sets off to find the treasure unaware of the dangers surrounding it.Directed by TV sitcom staple Jude Weng and written by comic book/screenwriter Christina Strain whose work can be seen in cult favorite TV show The Magicians and Netflix's upcoming series Shadow and Bone, Finding 'Ohana marks another original by Netflix. Finding 'Ohana feels like a mixture of Lilo & Stitch by way of National Treasure, and while there are good elements on display, the movie is a little clumsy out of the gate.Kea Peahu makes her debut here as our protagonist Pili and brings a natural energy to her performance that is engaging. She does a good job conveying the drive, stubbornness, and arrogance of her character and has some nice moments of vulnerability and pathos throughout the film. YouTube personality/singer Alex Aiono makes his film debut here and for the most part does reasonably well, but sometimes the clunky material especially early on doesn't allow him to make the best impressions, but despite this he does feel engaging and falls comfortably into his role as the older brother dealing with an overly energized mischief prone sister. The supporting cast is also quite good. Kelly Hu despite a somewhat limited role plays her role as a struggling single parent trying to juggle multiple crises at once quite well and Branscombe Richmond plays the curmudgeonly grandfather character quite well and has some very sweet moments with Kea Peahu as Pili where they convey a genuine sense of family. But easily the best performance is Owen Vaccaro as Casper a nerdy overly cautious neighbor who Pili (kind of) befirends who gets some very funny scenes and lines in the movie. Vaccaro was previously seen in The House with a Clock in its Walls playing a lead and its nice to see him here again giving another good performance.The movie itself is very hit and miss, the opening is very clumsily handled with characters often telling us about situations rather than showing us them, and while the characters feel like there's a richness to be explored for engagement and pathos, it often feels like those take a backseat to shenanigans and very on the nose humor. There's also not much in the way of drive at the beginning of the treasure hunt as the movie just kind of ambles along from one marker to the next. The flashback sequences are also rather underwhelming as they're subject to a running gag where the characters in the flashbacks will speak anachronistic dialogue as dubbed by Pili's Kea Peahu that is somewhat chuckle worthy upon first impression but becomes kind of grating upon repeated use. By the half way point I was ready to label this a very "meh" movie, but then it kept going.After a flabby first half that's haphazardly delivered the movie course corrects and makes its stakes more dire and adds some tension and drive that's been missing from the movie up to that point. Without giving too much away there's some scenes of visual wonder and danger that all tie into the themes of family and Hawaiian mythology quite well and actually make the movie feel more engaging as it goes on.Finding 'Ohana is clearly meant for a family audience, and as a family film its perfectly decent. The acting is spot on from everyone involved and the exploration of Hawaiian mythology is quite fascinating (though admittedly I'm unaware of how accurate it is) and the sense of adventure is quite fun once it gets going. Unfortunately clunky writing and an overly slow pace in the first half create some hurdles the movie needs to work around, but once it finds its footing it becomes an engaging adventure."

A Hawaiian family living in Brooklyn returned to Hawaii, went on a treasure hunt, and reconnect with their Hawaiian heritage.Now I'm aware that the movie aims toward family and kids, but I just could not like this movie. The acting was pretty bad, especially the main kid. I felt like she tried too hard to be edgy. The dialogues and jokes were mostly cringe and cheesy. When the characters retold the lore, the movie used the Ant-man lip syncing. Now in Ant-Man, Michael Pena was great the lip syncing worked very well. However, the lip syncing was quite bad and unfunny in this movie.The theme of movie was about reconnecting with one's heritage. I really liked the theme, but I don't think the story delivered and emphasized the theme enough. I don't feel connected enough to these characters to appreciate their change at the end, even though the change was pretty obvious.I still liked some part of the movie, particularly the interesting Hawaiian lore and culture. The adventure these kids went on was pretty decent.Overall, not my movie and the theme and story doesn't work. 3.5/10"

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10332588/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," Family friendly fun! ","IN A NUTSHELL: This cute action mystery is family-friendly and a lot of fun. If you love Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark , then you'll get a kick out of this movie because it has a similar adventurous feeling and has a lot of heart. In fact, some of the set pieces look like they came straight out of an Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark film. The movie was directed by June Weng, a TV sitcom staple, and written by Christina Strain, creating a film that feels like a fresh, tropical breeze.THINGS I LIKED: The cast of kids is really great and features the debut performance of Kea Peahu, who is totally adorable. The other talented kids include Alex Aiono, Lindsay Watson, and Owen Vaccaro. The adult cast spotlights Branscombe Richmond (not a very Haiwaiin-sounding name but he seems super legit), the handsome Hawaiian hunk Brad Kalilimoku, and Kelly Hu. Plus, there is a fun cast of pirates played by Chris Parnell, Marc Evan Jackson, and Ricky Garcia. The movie introduces you to geocaching. I got a kick out of the scenes where the kids' voices come out of the pirates' mouths when they're speaking. You get to see some gorgeous Hawaiian landscape. You see some beautiful spots where they filmed the popular TV show Lost - The Complete First Season and the movie Jurassic Park. It's on the gorgeous island of Kauai, the destination of one of my husband's all-time favorite vacations we took many years ago. We took a helicopter tour of Kauai while we were there and I felt like my eyeballs were so saturated with the beauty that I had to close my eyes every few minutes. This movie also features the Halona beach from the movie From Here To Eternity Speaking of movies filmed there, you might recognize the actor Ke Huy Quan who played the little boy in Indiana Jones and The Temple Of Doom. He wears the same baseball cap in this movie that he wore in that one. He also pays homage to his role in The Goonies with a key chain containing the "Pinchers of Peril" and referencing "Slick Shoes." There's a fun and lively soundtrack by Joseph Trapanese. Meghan Trainer gets featured a couple of times. The kids in the cast are really good singers too! There's a lot of humor both spoken and visual. Beautiful cinematography by Cort Fey. Cute rolling credits at the end. Although some of the sets looked like constructed sets, many of the visual effects by Jay Cooper were really good. It was clever to use muted colors in the scenes that showed the story of the pirates from long ago. You learn about "kapu" (sacred ground) and, in fact, all of the interior cave shots in the movie were done in Thailand so as to protect the spirits in Hawaii. The movie is long but definitely didn't feel like it. There plenty of escapades to keep you interested and entertained.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE: There are quite a few cringe-worthy acting moments. I can't stand bickering. I don't think it's charming at all. The family is super disrespectful to each other and some teenagers are really sarcastic to one another. Of course, I completely understand it's designed to show the character growth in the movie, but I still thought it was annoying. Spiders. EEEEWWWW! The mom played by Kelly Hu has grey streaks in her hair during the entire movie until the last scene. She also has 2 patches on one of her arms at the beginning of the movie that were never explained. What's that all about?TIPS FOR PARENTS: You get to learn a lot about Hawaiian culture. Some Spanish is spoken without subtitles. Hawaiian is spoken with subtitles and sometimes without. Siblings argue and smack each other around. Lots of comments about male nipples. The movie will definitely appeal more to kids than adults."

","Finding Ohana, advertised as The Goonies for the 21st Century and it has all the elements you'd want. It has the dysfunctional brother and sister, the good-looking friend that the elder brother fancies, the geeky sidekick. It has caves and traps and over complicated rocks pulley systems, it has pirates and treasure and needing money to save their Granddad's land and it has Data, well Key Hu Quan playing a family friend, but it's a Goonies link the Producers obviously wanted to help us all associate the film with the legendary classic. It has the beautiful Hawaiian scenery and link after link to Hawaiian culture. It has a trailer that makes it look like an amazing film. What it doesn't have are leads you are invested in, Ioane the older brother is too much of a self-obsessed idiot and it's highly unlikely that Hana will ever have any reason to fall for him. Pili and Casper are entertaining enough, but how they see the history of the pirates, much as it might be 21st century cool, is just really, really annoying - I honestly can't explain how them putting words into the mouths of actors and using modern terms really peeved me. Yes, it can be argued that I'm much older than the intended audience but it was incredibly irritating. And, all the opportunities for good old-fashioned pirate and cave adventures are not fully exploited. It's a Goonies Lite film with wasted potential. But hey I reckon children will love it."

And what could be considered real - there is not just one pill to take/swallow here but quite a bunch ... however you want to take that (in connection to other movies that had that as a theme).The two main actors are really good, but the flaws throughout and the fact that this does not seem to be sure what it actually wants to achieve, dampen the excitement a little bit to say the least.

There's a whole 'Matrix' type feel to events that occur in the story where it intentionally blurs the distinction between the 'realities' experienced by both. The 'reality' is further enhanced by the appearance of hologram people who flit around at the edges of Greg's existence, complicated by his recent divorce, getting fired from his job, and his daughter's (Nesta Cooper) attempt to connect with him following a period of estrangement. Isabel's response to Greg's fascination with his dream world is that it was made possible via animation, synthetic biology, and asteroid mining.Depending on one's point of view, this will come across as a significant foray into a hypothetical world or a pathetic attempt to disguise a poorly constructed story as brilliance. It might even depend on the time of day you watch it or whether one is under the influence of a mind altering substance. I couldn't decide myself, although I know which way I'm leaning.

We sometimes read news items about it, and wonder what "possessed" people to act out their strange behavior. But here, in this fictional movie, the writer/director makes his best effort. For the most part it is interesting and entertaining.Owen Wilson, long known for his goofy roles, is in fact a fine dramatic actor. We see him in an office as a sales guy, we see him called into his bosses' office to get fired. We see him talk to his daughter about attending her graduation. We see him in a lab-like setting being referred to as "Doctor". But when it is all done we still wonder which was real and which was just in his mind, as a faulty narrator.

We each have a vision of what our ideal world would look like. When we first meet Greg (Owen Wilson), he's working on multiple sketches of his: a picturesque Mediterranean villa and a beautiful woman to share it with. Greg seems to be escaping from a world that isn't so great. He's recently divorced, estranged from his son, and evades his daughter's attempt at reconciliation. He's also taking some type of prescription drug that he's clearly abused. On top of all that, Greg is supposed to be working his office job for a customer service company aptly named, "Technical Difficulties". The phone bank of employees are trained to answer each call with, "I'm sorry". At this early point, we aren't certain if this is a parody of office life or the set up for something else. Our uncertainty remains even after Greg has a disastrous private meeting with his boss.Things really get bizarre when Greg bolts from the office and into the local bar across the street. It's here where he first encounters Isabel (Salma Hayek dressed like a witch), who introduces him to the idea that this world isn't real. None of it ... except him. She has created a computer simulation of life and there are two pills/crystals for escape (this should sound familiar to fans of THE MATRIX). The yellow one allows Greg and Isabel to bend the laws of physics, while the blue one jolts them to the world that magically matches Greg's sketches. Like anyone with newly found superpowers, they head to the local roller rink, and take turns causing other skaters to fall until everyone else lay unconscious on the wooden floor. It's at about this point where I'm fighting the urge to give up on the movie.Writer-director Mike Cahill was behind two previous excellent movies that questioned our realties: ANOTHER EARTH (2011) and I ORIGINS (2014). However, this time out his approach is muddled and unstructured. It plays like a philosophical science fiction-romance, but we spend much of the movie trying to determine if the movie is too bizarre or not bizarre enough. A successful complex story will push us to buckle down and engage, but this one never allows us to connect with the characters, so we lose interest. It purposefully tries to trick us into choosing whether it's a computer simulation, parallel universes, or making a statement on severe mental illness. We don't have an answer until the end ... which would be fine were the journey more enticing.Asteroid mining, synthetic biology, and Isabel's "Brain Box", are given some credence thanks to cameos from Bill Nye (the Science Guy) and Slovenian philosopher Slavoj Zizek. Ms. Hayek and Mr. Wilson, both former Oscar nominees, have little chemistry between them, and the film's best performance, albeit with limited screen time, comes from Nesta Cooper as Greg's daughter. By the end, we realize this was a convoluted story line for what was really a pretty simple explanation, and somehow we feel a bit cheated with the whole thing.Streaming on Amazon Prime beginning February 5, 2021"

Salma Hayek and Owen Wilson are maybe not the best actors ever but they have a certain something that is pleasant to follow.

"," Shades of Kubrick and Cronenberg ",""Bliss" begins as a Walter Mitty-type film with a lazy, day-dreaming worker in an office drawing pictures of his fantasy home. It then takes the audience on a psychodelic journey of the mind.The strength of the film was the good performances and some great location footage of Los Angeles. The filmmakers were striving for a style that combined the imagination of Stanley Kubrick and the weirdness of David Cronenberg.The Kubrick-Cronenberg connection was apparent in the film's evocation of the macabre. The grisly death of Greg Whittle's boss; the pathos of an old woman on a walker knocked to the floor of a roler-skating rink; and an unruly mob at a party being separated like the Red Sea with a wave of Greg's hand, are all examples of something approaching dark comedy.But unlike the profundity of a film by Kubrick or Cronenberg, the result of "Bliss" was an exercise in style over substance. The long and dull portion set in the fantasy kingdom of Dr. Isabel Clemens and Dr. Greg Whittle was was slow-paced and tedious and closer to a European art film.It was clear that Isabel and Greg would eventually return to their homeless headquarters and that their supply of hallucinogens would eventually run out. The inconsequential theme of fantasy versus reality tried to hold the disparate elements of the film experience together.By the end, Greg would appear to be under the care of a daughter who genuinely loves him. But, based on the depth of Greg's character flaws, it seems likely that he will blow his chance for recovery. The film is really about two luckless losers who went on a drug-induced stupor and essentially returned back to square one."

","Though a lot of people are disappointed that it isn't really a science-fiction film in the way that some of its marketing suggests, 'Bliss (2021)' has pretty clear intentions right from the off and its small amount of ambiguity is either short-lived or extremely subtle (or both). It's basically an 'allegory' (technically the term only loosely applies) for drug use, abuse and dependency, with its lead character being pulled further and further into a dangerous delusion by a woman he meets in a dive bar. The movie tries to put us in the heads of its 'heroes', portraying their imagined superpowers as real world occurrences. It's not all that conceptually satisfying or, even, visually interesting, though, mainly because it sticks quite close to reality and most of it is shot with overly grainy, undeniably bleak cinematography. The only elements of the movie that aren't almost abrasive to the eyes are the ones that take place, essentially, inside the characters' heads. The problem is that these scenes are too few and far between for the drab look of the real world to be justified; you end up with a movie that just isn't nice to look at for, like, eighty percent of its runtime. There are also a few narrative issues, including some instances in which characters change their minds far too dramatically and far too quickly to be believable. Having said that, the film isn't bad. The performances are solid, especially in the storytelling moments that don't rely on dialogue, and the story is relatively resonant. It isn't told in the most efficient or, I suppose, engaging of ways, but it's told honestly and seemingly with the right intentions. Generally speaking, the picture is entertaining enough to see you through to its end. Though it isn't especially exciting and it does have its less successful moments, it's a decent effort that isn't afraid to try a few inventive things. 6/10."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10333426/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","3"," What if The Matrix was Boring ",""Bliss" has the ingredients of a low-stakes, non-action simulated-reality drama variation on "The Matrix" (1999) and similar movies--two worlds, fake and real people, central romance, superpowers, silly science-y explanations, drugs--it's just badly put together. It's poorly paced. Owen Wilson and Salma Hayek display no chemistry. The plotline with the daughter is even less interesting. And the drug addiction parable worse than that. The ambiguity of which world, if either, is real matters not, and either way there are shots that aren't apparently subjective from any character's point of view seemingly there only to mislead the spectator. Both worlds are underdeveloped, ugly and unimaginative in their own ways.One can see what the filmmakers were going for, because we've seen it done better before--not only "The Matrix," either ("Dark City" (1998), "eXistenZ," "The Thirteenth Floor" (both 1999), "Vanilla Sky" (2001), "Inception" (2010), "Source Code" (2011), etc.). But, here, the sci-fi or fantasy elements are treated with less interest than family and lovers' squabbles and problems of mental health and homelessness. Social realism in a fantasy world. How dull."

The only thing watchable in this movie was a likeble lead actors - they look good, they play good and you can see they had fun with their roles, especially Salma H. Other then that - there is absolutely nothing here to see. This is a one huge mess which i did not understood. The plot is a mess and it was told very poorly. Pacing was bad - at running time 1 h 43 min i was constantly watching at time of much there was left.Overall, "Bliss" is a colossal disappointment. I wasn't excepting anything, and still i was very disappointed. Avoid it, there are way many better movies to see."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10333426/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","2"," Romantic mind bending film that falls into the bliss of pointless ","1 out of 5 stars.Bliss is a science fiction drama film. Owen Wilsons and Salma Hayek character meet and she tells him that they are in some kind of simulation. They can bend the rules with there reality.The film has a theme of drug addiction and feeling lost in your own reality concept. But the plot is poorly put together. The script fails to make the characters interesting. It is boring. The acting is a bit stale with Owen Wilson and Salma Hayek.Its a mind bending concept that fails to be something more. It loses itself in its own reality with twists that is not even interesting to keep the viewers engaged."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10333426/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt"," Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote. "," Psst, anyone know where I can get me 10 of those blue crystals? ","Another creative wonder by Mike Cahill. Unless someone fully understands, or has/had addiction and/or mental health issues, this film may be confusing.I like how Cahill thinks out of the box, and the way this story was portrayed, was genius, albeit flawed. His screenplay was somewhat all over the place, sloppy, and did have some plot and technical issues. The story didn't flow and transition as well as it could have, like it did in his earlier film, Another Earth. Although the pacing was slightly better in this one, it still needed improvement and less filler for the 103 min runtime. For me, this film missed the mark and had much more potential than what I saw. Owen Wilson and Salma Hayek were great in their roles, as were the rest of the cast.It's a different film, but once you get what's going on, you'll appreciate it a little more. It's a decent one-time watch. So it's a 7/10 from me."

No I'm not saying the movies are anything alike.This one...you follow Owen Wilson through various aspects of his 'life'. With the Hayak character who shows up as like his mysterious spirit guide. It's a weird movie, well acted. Very interesting. But there is kind of a reveal later that really wasn't that big a surprise to me. The movie was good. I think the ending was good. 6/10"

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10333426/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," So underappreciated and misunderstood film. ","Mike Cahill never seems to disappoint me so far. All of his works are very creative and thought-provoking. This film is a truly awesome exploration of the human mind just like Enemy (2013) was, which is also an underappreciated and misunderstood film. There are at least 3 ways to interpret this film of what is real and what is fake, there are tons of hidden details which give hints. There's also tons of funny references to popular culture and some multiple-meaning themes as well. I say this is some fresh air in comparison to all the mindless films we get nowadays."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10333426/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt"," This mess would make Nemo take the Blue Pill ","Firstly anyone claiming this vapid, children's or idiots' version of Matrix has any redeeming aspects ought to have their head examined.It is no secret that most experts on developing technology think that 90% of humanity will be living in a drugged state and simulations. Read, or if you like watch on youtube some presentations by Yuval Harari. The fact is the vast majority of humans are simply not intelligent enough to understand that pretty much all of your externally detectable decisions preferences, fears, weaknesses, pleasures, interests are being catalogued, as it is cheap and easy to do with algorithms. But what is comings even more powerful: governmental and corporate entities will have administrative access to your brain at even deeper levels that you yourself do. Which is to say we were worrying about Orwell's 1984, when we should have been worrying about Huxley's Brave New World. Can you imagine democracy in such a world?So the false ambiguity in this film, and you can be certain that the makers themselves did not know whether to finish it as Wilson's character being a drug addicted severely mentally ill loser, or alternately someone living in a beautiful near perfect world, is ultimately meaningless. What difference does it actually make? We are not presented with any meaning,Even the only irony in this drek is unintentional: in that 56-yea old Salma's semi-nude scene is actually a simulation, done with a 26 year old body double. Also anyone who has seen the homeless situation in SF, LA, DC or other places where it is out of control despite plenty of shelters and food, knows the cops don't just roust the homeless anymore."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10333426/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," This is a Heartwrenching Film of Desperation, Not Quite Sci-Fi ","Let me also join in and say as a marketer, this film's marketing was terrible. Totally gives folks the wrong idea if they're expecting a neat little sci-fi film."Bliss" is not a sci-fi film. It's not quite a fantasy film either. It is a film about designer drug addiction, homelessness, mental illness, depression, separation of a family. It's about a man played by Owen Wilson, whose whole world fell apart at once. He was already on the edge of everything: homelessness, drug addiction, etc.; as he's going through a divorce, his family was split. He loses his job and meets a real bohemian, homeless, street prostitute, drug addict played by Salma Hayek. She convinces him to take a synthetic designer drug and escape to a whole world where they are together is not the real world.The film's marketing makes you think this is going to be a kind of sci-fi/fantasy feature, but it isn't. Maybe the thought was to make it one, but it couldn't fit in the drug addicts and homeless as that took over the film more than "the other world." It tried - it tried. It started well - the twist with his boss was funny, and then meeting Selma's character in a bar and how she laid it all out had that sci-fi/fantasy promise.Then the movie goes into the homelessness and addiction and prostitution, and you get as confused as Owen's character, so by the time they get back to the sci-fi/fantasy element, you know it's a drug trip.There is no happy ending here. Just go in knowing this is another way to show co-dependency, drug addiction, homelessness, surviving on the street, period."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10333426/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," LIfe in a simulation ","Similar in concept to "The Matrix", this is a really smart take on life in a simulated reality, especially for a relatively inexperienced writer/director. The simulation mechanism ("the Brain Box") has a decent plausibility factor which is certainly appreciated. Owen Wilson always seems to play these I'm-so-clueless roles so well, and Salma is in full stride with her latina accent, gestures, and mannerisms. One of the things to like about this treatment is that our protags get out of the simulation - no easy task - and then find the need to re-enter it, but only one can get out again. And this is "the problem" that's discussed in the story and why a story like this would make for a great 10-ep streamer, since the simulation mechanics are problematic and need improvement, an evolution that would play great over one or two seasons."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10333426/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," Lost in translation ","The synopsis of this movie was so badly and wrongfully portrayed that I spent 7/8 of it trying to work out not only what it was all about but where it was heading!It is Not SyFy in fact the whole movie bears zero resemblance to what it really is portraying or about which is a travesty."
