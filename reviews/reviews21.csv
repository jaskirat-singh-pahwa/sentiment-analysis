Dude is a super talented martial artist and he was underused? The biggest blunder was the film doesn't spend time to develop a relationship between Zul and Chen and just quickly move from one scene to the next.The story was convoluted and too fast. Considering that it got big budget on the action scenes, as well as the good cinematography and lighting, it seems like a waste of chance for a well-made local action flick like Polis Evo 2."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11348542/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," Starts with a clever take, then gets proud of how clever it is ","In the time that you'll read this, Mickey Reece may have already made a new movie. For four years in a row, he's had a debut at Fantastic Fest. You may have seen his Climate of the Hunter a year or so ago - time no longer makes sense, so it could have been months - and the first moments of this movie seem to rail against the slow boil of that movie by starting with a profane cake throwing rant by its titular character, Sister Agnes (Hayley McFarland, The Conjuring).For the first half of this film, I was fairly riveted by a tale that combined the Byzantine - or Roman, right? - politics of the Catholic Church as it struggles in the dawn of a new century, even as the possessions that defined the old church and the exorcisms that became pop culture decades ago rear their head again.As she serves at St. Theresa's convent - which remains rooted in the old ways of the church, with nuns not allowed to leave the grounds and men being limited - she finds herself in the grip of something demonic. But what has she done other than upset the natural order and asked her fellow sisters to confront who they are? Well, yeah, and foam at the mouth. One could arhue that Mother Superior (Mary Buss) is the real power destroying the lives of these women.Father Donahue (Ben Hall) has been selected by the powers that be - he was sure they'd caught on to his secrets and crimes - to exorcise the demon that he doesn't believe in, bringing along an acolyte named Benjamin (Jake Horowitz) who is the one person in the film that seems actually close to the divine. Donahue continually harangues the young not-yet-a-priest, demanding that he look into his heart to determine whether or not God offers him the life he really wants to live. This is an interesting take - the priest at the end of his road and the young man just starting his first steps.But like much of this film, it's a fleeting notion. Donahue's half-hearted exorcism ends with his nose being bitten off and blood covering everyone, leaving him no choice but to call in Father Black (Chris Browning), an excommunicated priest who has created his own cult of personality, complete with him being bound to the demon Bune - who in the Lesser Key of Solomon we learn is a duke of Hell with the ability to move the dead, make people rich and answer a variety of questions - and a beehive-hairdo-having, chain-smoking henchwoman who really deserves her own movie. If this entire moment of the film feels like it came straight out of El Dia de la Bestia that's a compliment.Just like every man in this movie, his exorcism is pretty ineffectual and feels cobbled together from every Italian ripoff of The Exorcist, such as Enter the Devil and The Return of the Exorcist. And then, when all seems lost, the film dissolves and becomes an entirely different film after Agnes and Mary (Molly C. Quinn, We're the Millers) have a moment that's more arthouse than Alucarda and suddenly the film becomes her story, cast down from a world of faith into the magicless world that we live in today, a place where hack comedians (Sean Gunn) let you down, where bosses demand sexual favors in the stockroom of grocery stores, where rent goes up, where even a demonic voice and being possessed yourself can barely change things. However, the return of Benjamin, now a full brother in Christ, may give her the faith - or at least a momentary respite - that she needs.There's a theme of losing love - a lover, a child - and having to turn to God even to discover that that may not be enough that runs through this movie. But the narrative shift and the lack of focus near the end of the film - it gives up on a been there, done that exorcism story with some new wrinkles to, well, tell another story that feels like we've been told before - damn the efforts.It looks great. It sounds amazing. But I get the feeling that by the end, Reece was already bored and thinking about what he was going to make next instead of finishing this one off. It's so disappointingly close to a movie that I'd tell people to watch but you can't make a recommendation like "watch the first forty minutes" or "fast forward a bunch" because that's not a recommendation, it's a litany of excuses."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11348542/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," Okay when it's horror, not worthwhile elsewhere ","Following a series of strange outbursts, a disgraced priest and his young friend are sent to investigate the stories of demonic possession plaguing a remote convent but when the incidents cause one of the nuns to leave the convent and start her life over the events of that day still weigh on her.This was a rather enjoyable low-key genre effort. Among the more impressive elements in the film is also a potentially troubling one in the stripped-down, minimalist approach here. Generally more concerned with endless dialogue conversations that spread the idea of the trouble in the convent as much as the visual cues that would clue someone into the potential of what's happening, that one manages the rare feat of giving an interest to the conversations taking place. With the two going back-and-forth together about the possible outcomes in their quest, the religious implications of their faith-based profession, and their backstories impacting the real reason for the visit alongside the numerous conversations between the nuns about what's happening to the possessed in their clergy, it has plenty to like with the stripped-down, conversation-heavy approach. When the film moves into more obvious and overt horror territory, there's quite a lot to like here. The initial scene of the outburst she throws signaling that something might be going on with her friend that includes all the usual associations with the genre including swearing viciously, countless religious blasphemies being uttered at anyone that will listen, and spastic body contortions that are supposedly impossible for a person to accomplish on their own that feel rather expected but no less enjoyable. The exploits of the several exorcisms that are carried out are kept rather low-key like the conversations but it has some intriguing aspects including the physical remnants of the interactions that are rather brutal with how shockingly sudden they come off with some mild but effective gore-gags in place. Overall, these here are the films' enjoyable and positive aspects. There are some issues here, and it is a singular point in the film that stands out. The second half of the film where it drops the convent for a drama about the friends' life after leaving is a complete tonal shift to what's happened before that it drags the film down heavily. The complete lack of anything remotely horror-related here with the film dropping the demonic possessions and religious fervor in favor of a slice-of-life drama revolving around the best friend attempting to reintegrate into society with a low-paying job, lousy apartment and a lack of social life is something that will disappoint most looking for constant thrills. Not only that, the fact that these scenes focus on the friend instead of the possessed individual of the film's title, who disappears with no resolution about her possessed state, shows a weird lack of interest in the main character, rendering a lot of it pointless. It's significant and holds this one back a lot.Rated Unrated/R: Graphic Language and Violence."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11350284/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," Watchable, but forgettable action movie... ","I must admit that I initially found this 2021 action movie titled "400 Bullets" to have an interesting cover/poster. And with it being a movie that I hadn't seen, of course I took the time to sit down and watch it.I didn't know anything about the movie prior to watching it, aside from it being an action movie.Writer and director Tom Paton delivered an okay enough movie. And by that I mean that the movie was watchable, but it wasn't an outstanding or particularly extraordinary movie. For me, it turned out that it was just a bit too generic.The movie was troubled by having a small cast, which meant that the performers had to put on additionally strong performances to carry the movie. But since they only had a subpar script to work with, then the movie wasn't all that great.I am sure that there is an audience out there for a movie such as "400 Bullets", however, I found the movie to fall somewhat short of properly entertain me. As I mentioned earlier, the movie is watchable, sure. But this this hardly a movie that I would recommend you rush out to get to watch. Nor is it a movie that I will ever return to watch for a second time.My rating of "400 Bullets" lands on a generous four out of ten stars."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11350284/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," Gurkha's Never Quit!!! ","Sometimes, the best military actioneers are low-budget thrillers set in confined spaces. Predictably, the bad guys outnumber the good guys, and the villains have far more ammo. Complicating matters, the heroes are cut off because mountainous terrain interferes with their ability to contact headquarters. Indeed, the villains enjoy greater advantages, while our heroes have only honor to inspire them. Meantime, both sides wage a constant battle for survival against the wintery environment with its bone-chilling temperatures and the pitch-black oblivion of nightfall in a country sprawling with mountains. "Black Ops" writer & director Tom Paton chose Afghanistan as the setting for his contemporary, white-knuckled, bullet-riddled exercise in war-time suspense and tension, "400 Bullets," starring Jean-Paul Ly, Andrew Lee Potts, and James Warren. Basically, an elite outfit of British soldiers, led by Bartlett (James Warren of "The Gentlemen"), is transporting a crate of high-tech missiles along with a fortune in gold ingots through Northern Afghanistan. The Taliban ambushes them, and everything goes sideways. A virtuous young British officer, Captain Noah Brandt (Andrew Lee Potts of "House of Salem"), is accompanying Bartlett and his culturally diverse soldiers. Two are heavily armed dames. Now, Brandt isn't part of Bartlett's unit. Instead, Brandt has orders to safeguard the missile guidance chips. Without these computer chips that Brandt totes around in a titanium case, the missiles would be so much scrap metal.Imagine our hero's surprise when the Taliban ambushes their small convoy of vehicles in the middle of the night, and bullets swarm around them like furious hornets! Initially, when the Taliban starts shooting, Bartlett jams on their brakes and careens to a jarring halt in the middle of the road. Noah follows another British soldier, Beasley (newcomer Eddie-Joe Robinson), out of their vehicle, while the Taliban rake the convoy with withering barrages of gunfire. This lethal hail of lead cuts down the ill-fated Beasley. Noah emerges moments later with blood caked on his head from where he smashed it when the vehicle braked. As he scrambles for cover, Noah notices Bartlett's men and women appear to have been wiped out, too. After Beasley dies, Noah manages to limp away with a minor wound and vanishes into the inky depths of night. Eventually, the resourceful British captain stumbles some twelve miles into a Gurkha army outpost. Incidentally, the title "400 Bullets" refers to the number of cartridges stored in this arsenal. Noah is frustrated when he learns only two soldiers patrol the arsenal. The rest of the Gurkhas have been redeployed to safeguard a road 40 miles away. Rana Rae (Jean-Paul Ly of "Viking Siege") removes the Taliban slug from Noah's side about the same time Taliban gunmen descend onto the outpost in their SUVs and start shooting the smithereens out of it.Little does Noah realize the nefarious Bartlett and his accomplices were playing possum during the ambush. Meantime, the Taliban shot the wrong Briton by mistake. The plain-spoken Taliban leader, Amir Wassiq (Adam Sina), apologizes to an annoyed Bartlett (James Warren of "Wrath of Man") about this unfortunate mishap. Amir complains that both Beasley and Brandt were identical. Earlier, the Taliban had arranged to buy the missiles with the guidance chips from Bartlett for a small fortune. Afterward, Bartlett and his treasonous chums had planned to go 'missing in action' and live happily ever after on their ill-gotten gains. The hand of fate that spared Noah trashes Bartlett's best-laid plans to get those chips.Honor as a central theme infuses "400 Bullets." Writer & director Tim Paton made the film as a tribute to the legendary mystique of Gurkha warriors. "I kind of feel like the Gurkhas," said Paton, "deserve their own 'Rambo.'" This represents the first time a Gurkha soldier has played the hero of a war movie. For the record, Gurkhas are Nepalese soldiers renowned for their military honor, expertise, and highly disciplined training. Ironically, although cast as a Gurkha, Jean-Paul Ly is actually of Chinese & Cambodian lineage. Surprisingly, nobody has derided Paton's efficiently helmed, nimbly paced, 90-minute epic for this politically incongruent casting goof. Not only is Ly thoroughly believable as a Gurkha, but he is also an accomplished stunt man. He has performed stunts in as many as 25 films and television shows, including "Lucy" (2014), "Now You See Me 2" (2016), "Doctor Strange" (2016) and the forthcoming "Venom" sequel (2021). If you haven't seen his brutal six-minute action short "Acr" (2020) on YouTube, you've missed a treat! Ly makes a vulnerable but sympathetic hero driven by his sense of honor to never capitulate no matter how desperate things appear. Just when his virulent adversaries think they've beaten him into submission, Rana rebounds for more abuse! Meantime, "400 Bullets" consists of more than just wall-to-wall firefights and fisticuffs.Paton milks the hushed moments between the mayhem for the utmost suspense and tension. He shifts from the deafening firefights outside the Gurkha facilities for scenes inside it with the heroes and villains stalking each other in nail-biting cat & mouse situations. Paton stages grueling close-quarters combat scenes that may strike the squeamish souls as too harrowing. These pugnacious combatants stagger around wearily and deliver savage blows with fists, knives, and feet. You'll feel as fatigued as they look when the victors collapse from sheer exhaustion. Nothing about the ferocious R-rated violence and profane language have been softened. Just about everybody utters the F-word. The key to a good thriller is a sadistic villain who never gives our two heroes a break. The atmospheric claustrophobia of "400 Bullets" generates a sense of paranoia as the heroes and villains fight with relentless vigor. James Warren drips with treachery, while Wayne Gordon as Johnson and Adesuwa Oni are take top honor as his sadistic subalterns. "400 Bullets" rewards both its heroes and its audiences with realistic shootouts and pressure cooker suspense."

It's a low budget action movie and, therefore, you know it's not going to be up to "Hollywood standard".There are a few glaring plot holes, and the "military porn" types may have issues with some of the equipment featured ... but I give it an 8 simply because I wanted a movie to watch ... this was only 90-mins long and it obviously wasn't going to require my 100% attention ... there is nothing "woke" about the movie (which is a refreshing change)All in all it is a human movie where the actors deliver their lines as if they are actually sentient beings, unlike the trashy wise-cracking witty-comeback-orientated movies that the less intelligent audiences thrive upon. It doesn't try to be too serious, but it doesn't try to be funny either.It is, essentially, a modern version of the old war movies some of us grew up on.It's more John Mills than John Cena, and I'm glad for that."

The main idea is that the good guys are fighting the bad guys and they only have 400 bullets. Yes, they are in an important advanced outpost with tanks, armored vehicles, humvees and lots of equipment but somehow the only two soldiers left there have no ammo... absurd.

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11366736/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," clever, funny, and sharp ","Greetings again from the darkness. If we have to depend on Dublin filmmaking for the year's first stellar comedy, then so be it. This is the first feature film from writer-director Rachel Carey, but it certainly won't be the last. Somehow she's created a black and blue comedy that plays like a mash-up of ZOOLANDER (2001) and BLOW THE MAN DOWN (2018), two films I feel sure had not previously been mentioned in the same sentence.Piglinstown is a small, working class community in Dublin ... the metaphorical 'other side of the tracks'. Michelle (Angeline Ball, THE COMMITMENTS, 1991) runs the salon, and is just one of the local business being threatened by gang activity and gentrification driven by greedy politicians. Michelle's staff includes Stacey (Erika Roe, HERSELF, 2020), a stylist who believes winning an upcoming competition can not only save the salon, but also her dreams of finally being accepted by the mother that deserted her many years ago; Gemma (Lauren Larkin), the in-house amateur psychologist and therapist; and Chantelle (Shauna Higgins, "Red Rock"), a socially awkward wizard with hair color. It's a motley crew of women who are stronger than they think, and display a camaraderie that defines small business and small towns.The ladies embrace the upcoming "Ahh Hair" competition as their road to salvation, where a win would boost the salon's reputation and make tearing the shop down for luxury apartments an unthinkable act. The problem is that the annual competition is consistently won by the posh shop where Michelle once worked before a catastrophic on stage occurrence many years ago. The high end shop is now run by her hilariously intimidating rival Pippa (Victoria Smurfit, "Marcella"). This becomes a bit of a parody of class distinction between Dublin's north and south side.But there is much more here than the hair styling competition. Some of the grit of the working class rears its head one evening when the gang leader threatens the ladies of the salon. One thing leads to another and soon the shop has earned its name, "Deadly Cuts." Although crime and violence play a role here, the gore is minimal and mostly occurs off screen, and even packs its own level of humor. Ms. Carey loads up her script with a slew of one-liners, each expertly delivered by a cast that embraces the cinematic lampoon. "The hair tongs are heating up" is merely one example of what is broadcast by FAD TV during the competition. For a rollicking good time, check this one out ... though you may need the closed captions unless your ears are in full Irish mode.Featured at the 2021 Seattle International Film Festival."

I liked the movie, and Aahana Kumra.Bawri Chhori is about Radhika who came to London to find her runaway husband and take revenge.The first few minutes grabbed my attention as the start of the movie looked unusual and interesting but as the film progressed it lost its momentum and finally turned out to be an average movie with so many missed opportunities.Radhika is helped by Aanad(played by Vikram Kochhar) and half Indian Anna(played by Rumana Molla) to locate her husband. In quest to find and take revenge Radhika travels to different part and meets different allies on the way.The movie could have been made more interesting. After first half almost every scene you can predict and the end result is not different. It turns out to be very predictable.Akhilesh Jaiswal, the director of the movie does a nice job but misses many opportunities to make an tight revenge film. The movie is very inconsistent. You would love some part but gets boring somwhere.Aahana Kumra is very versatile and she delivers a strong performance. Rumana Molla is refreshing and the sisterhood shown between Radhika and Anna is likeable.All in all an average movie, should have been made much better."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11373840/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," A slice-of-life tale lacking sufficient freshness and focus! [+43%] ","Conceived as a feel-good click, Saajan Bakery Since 1962 lacks focused writing and direction. It throws in a couple of good ideas here and there, but never explores anything in detail. Sibling rivalry is a worn-out thread in cinema; it'd take innovative characterization and treatment to add something fresh to this age-old trope. Betsy (Lena) and Bobin (Aju Varghese, who's also co-writing) play the sister and the brother, who run Saajan Bakery with their uncle Cherian (Ganesh Kumar). The trio delivers decent performances which keep the film watchable.When we get to the sixty-minute mark, it becomes obvious that Saajan Bakery doesn't exactly have a story to tell. Certain events unfold in a slice-of-life manner; the plot consistently sticks to its "unruly-lead-character-undergoes-progressive-transformation" template which makes the film uneventful and sans (many) surprises. The humour is a mixed bag. More often, the gags are harmless but a few seem deliberately regressive. The funniest stretch involves Bobin amateurishly attempting to make cream buns. There's also a quirky girlfriend character who randomly breaks the fourth wall. While it was fun initially, it became overused after a point. Heck, director Arun Chandu even uses it as a voiceover device to activate a subplot (regarding cream buns).Saajan Bakery does make you feel hungry with its wonderful food photography. Prashant Pillai's musical score is a definite plus too. But even these factors can't save the film from its drab writing and lacklustre direction."

Not recommended."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11373840/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","3"," Steer clear of Saajan Bakery ","You better think twice before venturing to devour anything from Saajan Bakery (since 1962). With such a promising setup and equipped with seasoned bakers, I had hoped for a feel-good treat. Alas, it turned out to be flavourless, unappetising and disjointed (maybe by trying to bake a lot of fresh stuffs together, but devoid of any pith) so much so that it was extremely difficult to chew it up or even gulp it down, leaving me with no option but to spit it all out."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11373840/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," The freshness of Sajan Bakery. ","Aju Varghese will be seen in a double role in the film as starrer. There is a concept that everyone may have in mind when they hear all this.Sajan Bakery Since 1962, directed by Arun Chandu, is an effort that transcends all those pre-conceptions.Aju Varghese is also co-writing the script for Sajan Bakery, which is co-produced by Dhyan Srinivasan and Vaishakh Subramaniam.Script of Sajan Bakery is good at writing. Its advantage is also manifested in totality.The film is set in Ranni and surrounding areas of Pathanamthitta district. The story revolves around Sajan Bakery, founded by Sajan in 1962 in Ranni.Bakery life. That is the freshness of Sajan Bakery.The character Sajan starts the film with the title and then few time at the end of the film. Sajan's sons Bob and Betzi are the main characters in the film.Their uncle, the mother-in-law and guardian, lives with them.The focus of the film is on sister-brother relationship instead of formulas.Brother and sister, who are not much older than each other, we can enjoy the fact that the chemistry between them works out well when Lena with Aju.And their uncle who has no burden of parenthood between them. Home life of all three.The director who cast Lena as Betsy deserves a horsemanship. Similarly, the casting of KB Ganesh Kumar in the role of uncle is very fresh.Aju Varghese is doing well as Sajan and Bobin. Both made Both were Aju Nice.I do not remember ever seeing Ranjitha Menon on screen never. She is living perfectly in screen as a Ranni Nasrani.

How ironic that while "Mohan kumar" was trolled and widely criticised for its abundance of feel good moments, this movie was at the receiving end of trolls and taunts mostly owing to the fact that it lacked dramatic positivity spreading scenes or inspiring dialogues. In other words, it was kept as close to life as possible and hence consequently ended up being boring and lacking objectivity to the first to respond self employed film critics. So now, it's pretty certain that expect for a movie like "Home" that might pop up every five years or so, this would be the end of the feel good genre, a trademark of 80's and 90's as it seems impossible for any writer and director to include the right amount of dramatic scenes and dialogues in a feel good movie.

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11374902/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," A fairly enjoyable dark-comedy thriller with a few red flags and an okayish finale! [+63%] ","One thing writer-director Nelson Dilipkumar's good at is infusing wry humor into conventionally serious situations. In Doctor, he sticks to his core strengths, plotting a bunch of misfits who come together to battle a kidnapping situation. Another director would have milked the family angle so much to extract more sentiment, but Nelson chooses to make us laugh instead. While SK's deadpan act works, given how the character is etched, the supporting cast totally nails it. Led by Yogi Babu and Redin Kingsley, both in top-form, the film generates situational laughs during many scenes, especially in the middle portions.Once the film moves to Goa, the laughs dwindle slightly, but the engagement factor remains on the higher side. A big chunk of the packaging is on Anirudh's musical score, which again works so darn well. There's also a fun lights-out action scene inside a metro which is superbly staged, with every actor doing complete justice to their parts. The final 20 minutes lack the much-needed closing punch, but when the credits start rolling, you forget what the main plot was because by then, it's the supporting cast and their inherent wackiness that you'll remember Doctor for. What Lokesh Kanagaraj managed to do with the action genre - giving mainstream Tamil cinema a much-needed update - Nelson's trying to do with dark comedies. The absurdity levels remain at their peak all through.Overall it's a fun watch if you can ignore some of the casual misogyny and gender-based humor (why's a man dressing up as a woman perceived to be funny in 2021?). The heroine is reduced to an unintelligent pawn, and it was weird to see her family stay quiet while SK's character keeps making snarky remarks. Just because SK's character is a do-gooder doesn't take away his toxic traits. I'm hoping Nelson doesn't amp this up in his next film with Vijay."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11374902/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," A slightly different plot with Director's usual pattern ","The biggest advantage this movie has is wrt to the characters being played by known/popular faces which in itself is a big marketing trick to make it go far. Although the plot was in line with the director's previous one but with a different genre, it didn't bore at all, again maybe due to the performances of the usual comedians with an unusual structure.I think the best thing about this movie is that the sub-step scenes were removed which would've made it way worse, for-ex the fight sequence, in the end, was removed and instead the film ended with just a few gunshots & bombings.This film neither stands out nor is mediocre, definitely one-time watchable stuff."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11374902/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," A good premise that unfortunately loses steam towards the end! ","Director Nelson Dilipkumar's latest outing has many of the similar elements that made his directorial debut Kolamavu Kokila (2018) a hit. A middle-class family, thrown into a world of deceit and crime, dollops of dark humour and a motley crew of quirky, eccentric characters.Sivakarthikeyan plays the titular 'Doctor, a seemingly emotionless army surgeon, who makes it his personal mission to find the kidnapped niece of his fianc. He assembles a rag-tag bunch of misfits to perform the task, which is where an excellent Yogi Babu and an over-the-top Redin Kingsley make their grand entrance.The duo manages to infuse a lot of humor which combined with outlandish twists and turns makes the first hour quite entertaining. However, the movie loses steam towards the end with the logical inconsistencies and the ease with which the many issues in the film are resolved by the climax, leaving the viewer dissatisfied.Sivakarthikeyan has clearly given his all for the role, playing the scheming, Machiavellian doctor with ease, nailing the body language and mannerisms of the extremely practical-minded character. Another notable performance was Deepa Shankar as the bungling house maid who delivers some of the funniest dialogues in the film, accentuated by her funny expressions.Milind Soman delivers a characteristically appalling performance in a cartoonish guest role while the heroine, Priyanka Arul Mohan is given precious room to shine. Vinay Rai, who excelled as a suave, debonair villain in Thupparivalan (2017), tries to recreate the same magic here but is let down by shambolic writing. This truly has to go down as one of the stupidest writing for an antagonist in a thriller film, such is the ease with which the hero dismantles his entire operation.Overall, Doctor has more lows than highs. I just wish the director had managed to sustain the same frequency of unexpected twists and moments of dark humor that we saw in the first hour, for the entire length of the film. The setting of the stage was quite grand, the follow through, sub-par.Just an average watch. Not recommended!"

","Movie review: Doctor (Tamil film) streaming on Netflix #sanjuzzreviews #doctor2021 Just saw this film for a lark without reading the synopsis or having any background of the story. It was pleasantly entertaining.. I can definitely vouch for it !!Doctor is a dark comedy, action thriller directed by Nelson Dilip Kumar and starring Sivakarthikeyan as the protagonist Varun.Varun is an army doctor who gets rejected by his fiancee for being emotionally detached. Despite being hurt by her rejection, he decides to help her out when her neice gets kidnapped by a human trafficking mafia. He uses the same qualities (emotional detachment) along with his wit to create a team of conmen to con the bad guys and rescue the girl. Sounds confusing right? This is what the film is all about.A different kind of an experiment with comedy action drama, all packed in to make a complete "hotch-potch", yet coming up with a winner in the end.You will like this if you enjoyed Andhadhun.Would love to see more films in this genre in future...

Those characters gave a perfect feel as an antagonist and protagonist for this sort of story.Comedy tracks, Humour, timings, counters worked out really well. Gave special importance to all those characters and got the best output from everyone of them. Hats off! Anirudh's fire creating BGM, proper camera work and light work, editing, artwork, dialogues, everything else added as a plus. Slightly slow on screenplay, but the comedy tracks pushed it harder to move faster.Very good family entertainer makes everyone to Roll on the Floor and Laugh in many scenes. Must be the Biggest Box office and blockbuster hit for Siva Karthikeyan bro this year.Royal Salute for Director Nelson. He modified and restructured Sivakathikeyan's commercial formula. Standing Applause for the crew members.Special Mention to appreciate: Redin Kingsley (Pushed the scenes faster with his comedies in the necessary portions)Really hard to handle this kind of serious emotional content. Movies like Taken, Traffic kept us seriously emotional till the end. It was really challenging to play the comedy throughout the film. Surely this must be appreciatable!#Nelson Big Claps "

Great performances from Kingsley and Yogi Babu, while guys like Bjorn also made their impact.Only thing I'd criticize is the climax scene which I felt was a typical commercial film ending. The movie could have avoided that clich which didn't really add anything to story. There were a few scenes here and there that felt like they were dragging a little too long, however it wasn't a huge issue.Overall an extremely solid movie from Nelson and Siva Karthikeyan who continues to impress us with his interesting script.

The screenplay at times is a bit dragging but it's justified when you look at the movie overall.The background score, story, Sivakarthikeyan's stoic acting, Redin kingsley's quirky dialogues, Yogi Babu's comedic timing blends well together.

","Yikes, if you are from anywhere else in the world, you might be forgiven for thinking "is this state of the once mighty British television industry". You might also be forgiven for thinking that if you come from the UK, too... It did enlighten me as to one things folks who travel with BA might have seen at the start of the safety video - here is the same "Chabuddy G" (Asim Chaudhry) who acts as the manager for the gang of lads whose success at radio station "Korupt FM" has led to one of their songs being used on one of these game shows that only the Japanese can make (or appreciate). Off the boys go, in search of fame and fortune, only to discover that they are only to be subsumed into a corporate entertainment culture that they are ill suited for - and their long established personal ties are soon stretched to breaking point. There is chemistry between the men, and oddly enough i felt a little for them as they struggle to impose their own unique integrity on the perfectly coutured "Taka" (Ken Yamamura) who cares not a jot about the people, only about the cash and kudos he can obtain by exploiting them. I find this kind of humour a bit puerile, and cringe making but I guess I'm not the demographic - there were certainly folks in the cinema who laughed out loud; so i suppose I can only say that if you like the television series, you may well like this. If not, then I wouldn't bother."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11376010/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," The transfer doesnt quite work ","'ve missed the likes of Chabuddy G , MC Grindah , DJ Beats and Steves since the brilliant BBC comedy People Just Do Nothing left our TV screens three years ago here in the UK . So when I heard they were bringing out a film , I couldn't wait to see it , but sadly , like one of Chabuddy's business deals , this spin off , falls flat on its face .After Brentfords largest Pirate radio has ended, the boys from Kurupt FM find their way to Japan on a epic adventure in search of Fortune and Fame.This is not a bad film it's just extremely disappointing. Perhaps that's because I'm a fan and was expecting more laughs but I can't help but think , what on would someone who hasn't watched the show think about this movie . I'd suspect they might be a little confused.The whole concept of them going to Japan and having their profile changed to suit a Japanese audience is an obvious one but the writers didn't take advantage of the situation as well as they could have .There are a few funny moments , and the people in the theatre were laughing but just not enough .Perhaps the format is only suited to being a 25 minute long TV episode and not a film and maybe it being set abroad takes the characters out of their comfort zone too much ?I still hope they revive the TV show because I don't think it's done it's course but that's where it should stay as the transfer to big screen just didn't quite work."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11376010/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Great mockumentary ","Whilst the plot is very predictable, People Just Do Nothing: Big in Japan is still a great mockumentary that's really funny and heartwarming whilst also being very accessible to newcomers.

But their friendship is tested when the idea of fame & the music industry isn't what the think it is.I found the film to be pretty good!

The film also presents a message of knowing who your friends are & to be yourself & not sell out!

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11376010/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Bang on! ","Having experience in both UK music culture and Tokyo life this film isn't as far off the mark as some people seem to think it is.The Tokyo locations, mostly Shinjuku and easily recognisable to locals are well chosen, the language and culture barrier details are multilayered and well observed, and not done in a way to be actually stereotypical or derogatory.The music industry is heavily managed in Japan, and image can be meticulously sculpted, just like in the US/UK manufactured pop scene.Faded and fallen acts can have surprise success in Japan, - 90s wash outs Kula shaker playing festivals just a few years back!!, and that success is often devoid of it's original scene context, ie Japan will like mohawked punk without knowing about thatcher govt and the social and political scene that created it, they just like the look and sound of it and enjoy it on that level.So this film got all of that right and delivered it with good humor, although it did cherry pick its cultural points specifically to forward the story, so practically none of the amazing positive things about Tokyo were shown; it's vibrancy, respect, deep culture and history, generous and deeply funny and fun people, self aware, smart, creative, that stuff doesn't really get much of a look in here, but that's fine, it's not the story they're telling.So too it gets the deluded low level musicians of the electronic music scene. So many clever details (why have I got a guitar in my hand??), only got 2 songs, Beatles etc, And then the social commentary is great."I've never received a salary in my whole life"."I didn't enjoy it, but I loved it" "It tastes normal" etcA lot of this rings true and is pretty funny.I know the Japan portrayed is supposed to play on that trope "oh those crazy japs " etc but, it's not that crazy when you live amongst it."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11376010/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," As a PJDN virgin, I still laughed a lot! ","It's brave that such a relatively niche UK TV show should have a go at 'jumping the shark' onto the big screen. Would fans like it? And, just as importantly, would newcomers to the characters, like me, be able to enjoy the film as a standalone entity? The answer to the last question is a qualified "yes".Positives: It well-surpasses the "6 laugh test" for a comedy. There are some scenes that I found extremely funny, with others that rated highly for me on the David Brent / Alan Partridge scale of cringiness.I've seen comment that the story is "silly" and "unbelievable". But having experienced the crazy clash between English and Japanese culture first hand, it strikes me as very true to form! The way in which the Japanese music execs try to stylise the ground as a 'boy band' ("Bang Boys"!), which Grindah greedily goes along with, is a nice satire on the music industry asserting its brand over musician's art.A subplot of a love story between the inept Steves and the cute Japanese translator Ishika (Ayumi It) is nicely done and strangely touching.The good news is that you don't need any previous experience of the characters to get fun out of the movie: you can jump right in. That being said though, I'm sure fans of the series will get more out of this than I did.Negatives: While the ending was uplifting, I was itching to know what fallout (or success?) there was from the event we witnessed. Perhaps if its a box office success (unlikely I think!) then there will be a sequel.Summary Thoughts on "People Just Do Nothing: Big in Japan": IMDB is littered with disastrous reviews of British TV shows that have tried and failed to make the leap from the small screen to the big screen. "On the Buses"; "Are You Being Served?"; "Steptoe and Son"; "Please Sir"; "Love Thy Neighbour" - the list is endless. They are mostly all horribly unfunny. Even the great "Morecambe and Wise", although showing occasional moments of brilliance, struggled to fully land any of their three big-screen outings.The 'go-to' of many of these efforts was to "go abroad": take the well-loved characters and put them into a 'bigger' and stranger pool. So "People Just Do Nothing: Big in Japan" was following a well-trodden path here. It's a tribute to the team and their TV-series director Jack Clough, in his feature debut, that they pretty much pull it off.I'd like to agree with Kevin Maher of "The Times" that the movie is full of "Japanese stereotypes... drunken businessmen, passive giggling women etc". But having travelled extensively on business in Japan, it seems pretty close to the mark with its observations to me! More importantly, the film never seems to be particularly derogatory or disrespectful of the culture. For example, they take their shoes off too much!Key to its box office success will be whether or not it can attract an audience outside of its niche TV fan-bases. As a member of that sub-group, I really wasn't expecting to enjoy this one, but I actually did. It was good fun, and if you want a good laugh at the cinema - a pretty rare thing - then I'd recommend this one, even if - like me - you haven't seen the original TV show.(For the full graphical review, please check out onemannsmovies on the web, Facebook and Tiktok.

The accents took a bit getting used to, but after that it was fine and easy to understand all of the characters. I expect it's better if you are familiar with the show and the episodes for more context.Doing TV series movies where characters go on holiday is nothing new. It boils down to characters and situations they get into that make them good and engaging. There was actually more emotional depth and relatability to this than I initially expected, and it's got some great shots here and there too. The Mockumentary aspect was a nice touch too. Just a fun watch overall and does what it sets out to do effectively.7/10."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11376010/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","3"," Watchable, but very underwhelming. ","Ugh, the ratio of 'jokes to runtime' is low...very low.When you consider that the original 20-ish minute episodes were crammed with hilarity and solid jokes every few minutes, you'd expect more from a 90 minute feature-length movie. Unfortunately, the jokes are few and far between...and the jokes aren't even that funny.Maybe it's a different writing team to the series, or maybe the Kurupt FM novelty has just worn off. Perhaps they should of done the movie straight after the series ended, while they were still hot. Or maybe the whole 'going to Japan' thing threw things out of whack...perhaps they should of kept it in and around Brentwood. Whatever the reason is, it is very visible and apparent that this doesn't live up to the name. So don't expect too much.Everything and everyone seems toned-down and diluted. Most of the elements that made the series a hit are missing.It's more of a drama, than a comedy/mockumentary."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11376010/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","1"," Awful movie ","I enjoyed the show, I felt series one to three were solid 8.5/10 and 4 and 5 were a bit more commercial but overall we're good 7-7.5/10, I was quite surprised this got made in to a movie, it doesn't feel commercially popular enough or really have the scope to fit 90+ minutes so I was sceptical and sadly proven right.I sat with a 30-40 person audience and bar chuckles at steves none of the jokes or humour landed, to the point I actually felt embarrassed for the guys doing it, the plot wasn't horrific but it was just forced and didn't feel true to the series.Grindah just felt off, too emotional and accommodating for stuff he'd never agree to, I mean he hated a comment on the internet so bad he shut it off so we're supposed to buy he's doing all that? Didn't fit right. I find the forced oblivious to reality ego annoying but he's true to himself and in this film he wasn't so just felt the dynamics suffered.Beats just says small sentences or looks at the camera, he's suddenly grown a pair and stands up for himself more, again just didn't land, think he had one line get a laugh but the camera looks just became irritating. The only humorous bit was Craig being his boss, that guy is ginormous now. Even did a queen joke just to call him Eddie Murphy... cringeDecoy... I mean what's the point, does the camera looks expressionless and it feels his only purpose is the joke about angel. Which was made the exact same way and it just wasn't funny and I don't genuinely believe it's possible to be that stupid, he's done well to get paid for literally 3 lines. Rubbish character.Chabuddy.. he was for me a character when new and fresh it was hilarious, really funny and well done, it became stale in the series and the film nothing he did or said got a reaction, again you question how anyone can be that naive and stupid but either way the character was off. The same jokes, everything just felt a bit embarrassing really, got no laughs and just felt a bit outdated.Mich.. I'm surprised she's an actress really, she's dreadful, nothing about her is funny, another one just being needlessly stupid for jokes even though it's just obvious, I get what they're going for but it's just not natural and she doesn't have chemistry with the group even though in real life she's with steves.The Japanese lot were fine, I enjoyed the interpreter thought she was fun and Taka to was decent at his role. Nothing bad to say, the takeshi/wipeout style show was believable.The only saving grace in this movie was Steves he was natural and genuinely funny, if it was 90 minutes of him and the interpreter it'd be a classic, his timing and mannerisms for comedy are great, he's the only one that brought any atmosphere to the cinema.The jokes were corny, poorly written script, too slow moving and things that work well in 22minute tv shows don't translate to movie particularly well. I really wanted to like it and thought maybe I just didn't get it but hearing bc a lot of people walking out it was all except Steve this was rubbish.. sad end to a decent show."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11376010/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Hilarious! ","I've never actually seen the TV series so I went into this film pretty much blind, I'd seen the trailer and thought it seemed pretty up my street. I was exactly right, perfect British humour with hilarious moments that lead to just an enjoyable film. The writing in this is so good and the jokes and cringe moments work so well. I like the sort of documentary style of filming this has, I think it works so well with the characters and the way they present themselves. Being from England myself there were so many British tropes and jokes in this that really made me laugh. I haven't laughed this much in a film for a long time. Nothing much to really say about this film other than go and see it if your looking for a funny new film to see. Hilarious!"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11376010/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","3"," The decline of a once-great show is complete ","The editing was good. The actual comic and dramatic material here is dire, but hey, at least it's tightly edited.These are shallow, cartoon versions of the characters we knew and loved in the first three series. The smart, subversive humor and social realism that made the show's early years so wonderful - in episodes like Weed Drought, Promotion, Clubnight, New Friends and Valentimes - is absent here, even more so than in the weak series 4-5. Whereas the show's emotional moments used to feel authentic and truly earned, here forced sentimentality reigns. The first twenty minutes or so are fairly pleasant, as we're reimmersed in the show's world and reacquaint ourselves with the characters, but once the action moves to Japan, the script takes the most obvious, cliched choice at every turn, and almost none of the humour lands. All the major characters have become hackneyed, but Chabuddy's material is particularly weak. Grindah's ego is intact, but the rest of his character seems to have been lost along the way; I like that the film at least tries to give him a character arc, but it's nothing we haven't seen before. Beats has little to do apart from lots of looks to camera, a joke the film overrelies on. The same Miche who sold Grindah's jacket to make ends meet, and had the courage to break up with him when his behavior crossed the line, is reduced to an airheaded cheerleader for her husband. The only characters who feels consistent are minor ones like Roche, Decoy, Angel and Craig - in fact Roche is the highlight of the film.The decline of this show is like a microcosm of what happened to The Simpsons. I never thought I'd say this, but I can only hope that this is truly the end."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11376010/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","1"," Boring and dumb ","What a boring movie, it offers nothing at all to the viewer.

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11376010/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," You will laugh i'm pretty sure ","PJDN: Big in Japan was a film i was unsure about what expectations to go in with having had some prior experience of the series. This film's main aim is to get the audience laughing and it achieved this with flying colours - around 80% of the jokes were met with giggles and chuckles all round which for a 90 minute film isn't bad going. The only reason i can't rate this higher is that its not a film that will stick in my memory or have an affect on me beyond the experience at the time. That being said i do think its worth a watch especially if you enjoy the show already and even if you have no prior knowledge you will enjoy your time."

It looks incredible, cinematography is stunning through the entire picture. I also really enjoyed the tension building throughout. Plot and tone-wise it reminded me a lot of Brimstone and Treacle, or the more obvious Night of the Hunter. The music was well crafted and helps immensely in building the tone of the film. And for the most part I thought all of the performances were great. But...I wasn't a fan of Mark O'Brien's performance overall. It felt a little forced at times and his glossy eyed bad boy just didn't work for me. There were also issues with the plot, mostly small stuff but I also found the final act to be a little too short on information. Obviously that's intentional but I feel too much was left unsaid about what exactly is happening.Overall, definitely worth a watch if you're into slow-burn tension filled occult/folk horror. But you may be disappointed with where it all ends up."

She obviously has loads of money cos the technical crew were obviously trying their hardest to turn this trite little thing into a decent looking visual experience, but honestly, it thinks its deep while it is purely admiring itself in a reflection ... This gives shallow a new peak to look up to ... This may gain a following amongst the simpletons that thought "The Room" was so bad it had something to offer, rather than just being best thrown in the bin and forgotten about ... If you fancy loosing even more faith in humanity, watch this fiasco. As for the Young woman, I would suggest she sticks to acting ... In daytime soaps or teen programming."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11378876/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","3"," Orpheus uses Inception to heal the mind with hamfists ","There were plenty of visuals and lighting that made this film pretty to look at, but so much else about it was wrong, discordant, and not appealing.First off, it's not really a story meant to entertain, but a metaphor/allegory/arthouse (take your pick) for the journey within. So skip this if your looking an adventure to an alternate world.On the other hand, if you want something artsy that addresses mental health, this might be up your alley.At no time did I find the soundtrack pleasant. It was always a little discordant, a little annoying, and I'm sure that was on purpose. But it made me very edgy and unhappy, and wishing it would hurry up and get to a new track.Many scenes dragged on with characters doing weird things just to be weird. It reminded me of someone wanting to be surreal but never quite getting there or understanding it. Rather clunky, but perhaps with some practice they'll improve.I did not care for the attempts to mislead by pretending there WAS something metaphysical/supernatural happening. Other than being a red herring, I think it's slightly disrespectful to those who believe in the consciousness and higher realms.All Margaret's encounters with the demons were super hamfisted attempts to be subtle, but they just dragged on harder and longer and got worse as the movie progressed. The attempt to hide the message of the encounter was there, but it was as amateur as the surrealism.Also, was I supposed to like any of the characters? And if Mom and Dad are at such odds with each other, why are they still together after 20 years? Seems like the child's death would have finished driving them apart.Lastly, how much guilt would a 4-year-old even imprint upon themselves that they're still a wreck 20 years later? I had some traumas and tragedies around that age frame, and it didn't imprint to that level. Now, if all her angst were spawned from feeling like her parents blamed her and they had treated her like crap, I would have felt a lot better about her catharsis. As is, it felt unearned and unwarranted.Waste of time for anyone other than arthouse lovers who want to feel superior."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11378876/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," Confusing but stylish enough ","Not sure what this film thought it was trying to portray. I sure as hell didn't get any sense of what this film was about. That isn't always a bad thing it's just this film annoyed because of it as felt for a first time directing that Carlson has some real directing talent. I'm sure some sort of message was meant to be portrayed, I just found the end feeling I was left with was frustrating. It was pleasing to the eye and some scenes were quite well done, the music was good too. I've no doubt that Carlson will be making some very good films in the future."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11378876/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," A mesmerizing and emotional movie. ","THE BLAZING WORLD is the journey of one woman to reclaim her past and face her devastating depression from a childhood trauma, all presented as a dark fairy tale. Think Nicolas Winding Refn directing a script from David Lynch inspired by Lewis Carroll. First time filmmaker Carlson Young uses dazzling, darkly neon, and twisted visuals to tell this story, and her striking vision puts her great talent on full display. Dermot Mulroney impresses and Udo Kier is damn creepy. Crushing and gorgeous to watch with an utterly haunting score, the film is a mesmerizing, emotional experience you won't soon forget. Bravo Carlson Young!"

The empty cup is the most Holy Cup yet a cup full of gratefulness and compassion is just magical!How much would our projection of Earth change if everyone learned to go inside and maintain peace upon their within?

That's not the say I don't hate the film; however, I find myself entertained.The story made things clear, unlike the short, about where this might be going. The first half is great and the second half makes you fall off a cliff. The cinematography is still present but I think it's a bit weaker than the short was. Nothing was pushing the boundaries. The acting had some potential and I think there was just one over the top moment that had me questioning it. The score is lovely and I love love love the lighting in this film.This is a film that has already divided audiences during the screening. Most of them virtually left the screening. I wanted to stay and see what was going to happen. It turns out I was just satisfied with half of the film, but a majority of its technical aspects really hooked me."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11384004/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," Shekar Kammula's Meta-Narrative is "TOUCH"ing!!! ","Love Story is set in Hyderabad whose most famous love story is that of Quli Qutub Shah who swam across a river during flood times to save the love of his life, Bhagmati. This love story is between people who are from two different religions and social positions, and the only thing binding them is love. Hyderabad's foundation is built on love. Therefore the love story buds and grows in Hyderabad. And we are lured by it.Real story surfaces when the couple realizes that they are unequal and even if they want to live together, it won't end well for their families. And here chaitanya's character has more to lose. Because since childhood he resented his unequal status and faced many hardships to create whatever he has now.One beautiful aspect of this movie is how it deals with "TOUCH". For sai pallavi's character physical touch reminds her of the atrocity she faced as a child. For Chaitanya's character, being from a lower caste his touch is always considered impure. And beauty of writing comes out in a scene when he touches her, she feels discomfort even though she knows his touch is not intentional and he feels sorry as well as angry when she reprimands him, but he cannot show.They both carry a lot of emotional baggage in this movie. Which is why when heroine KISSES hero, it had a huge impact. And he cries when she kisses conveys the acceptance he feels of both her love and society as a whole. HIM BEING UNTOUCHABLE ALL HIS LIFE IS WIPED OFF WITH THAT TEARDROP.This is most mature writing I have seen from any Telugu director in recent times. Many questions were raised that we overlook in our day-to-day lives like What is Masculinity? How can child abuse affect their education? How can drinking father drains his child's security into gutter? Is his father's drinking habit root cause of all her problems? OR Is it the voyeuristic nature of a human mind? How can discrimination make you insecure? And when will you be free of that insecurity? Maybe never!!My only concern is due to this heavy lifting, somehow the atrocity faced by sai pallavi's character took a backseat till the penultimate portion of the movie. And the movie redeems its mistake with the powerful performance of Devayani (sai pallavi's mother) in a single scene in the climax."

Then enters the concept of going to Dubai to earn quick bucks by doing two to three menial jobs simultaneously and no contact for six months with his lover. Then the idea of register marriage and fake suicide to evade the eyes of her Bawa. Then out of nowhere comes the accusation of molestation and opening up of pent up fear . What a Hawla movie made by the director. Pathetic First half is good which has been savagely killed by the second half of the movie and deserves 2 out of 5. The only saving grace is dance of the lead actor Sai Pallavi and there is nothing to watch in the movie.The first half of the movie had decent jokes and the chemistry was also good but the second half was unbelievable. It appeared as if the first half was written by a good script writer and the second half was written by another script writer. Horrible script writing. Usually Shekhar Kammula movies have two chartbusters songs , in this movie there was not a single good song . There was not a single trademark of Shekhar Kammula.Total and complete waste of time .

"," June On Planet Marathi Review: Seesaws Between A Sweet And Hollow Depiction Of Mental Health And Small Town Claustrophobia ","Small town Aurangabad, June 2019. Neha decides to shift from Mumbai to her husband's house in a cheek-by-jowl colony in the small town. One of the residents of the colony sends a text message to his friend on seeing her - standing unbothered, a puffing cigarette on her lips - "It's like an ocean in Aurangabad." Her husband is nowhere to be seen. Neha refuses to pick up his phone calls, and when we first see her, packing up her Mumbai house, all the photo frames are facing the other way. Neha doesn't want to confront her past."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11384400/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," If Dil Chahta Hai was set in a small town. Real and beautiful. ","June is about healing. And in times like these we need more films like this. We have seen so many films about young people who grew up in cities in film families or business families where money is never an issue. But we hardly get to see a film about friendships, about relationships that aren't necessarily romantic but still heal, still change, still push people to go higher in their minds. June is as much about Aurangabad as it is about the two protagonists. Nehha Pendse is the surprise factor of this film. There are scenes where she totally surprises you with her naturalness and earnestness towards the character. Sid menon is as usual lovely. I'd earlier seen him in the gay romance titled Love on Netflix. Jitu joshi again is always a welcome face. One wishes one saw more of him. But the subchatacters of June and their sub plots are just as important in the film. And the film deals with certain dark spaces also in a healing manner. The girl who cuts herself while shaving just melted my heart. And that conversation about a turtle in a well on a bench between a boy and girl was another favourite scene. I look forward to what this director duo do next either together or separately."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11385078/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," Skip it ","Review By Kamal KTuck Jagadish is a film predominantly made to remind us about the beauty of joint families, the sensitive issues in villages which brings divide among the people etc. Director Shiva Nirvana got a huge casting and gave relatable names to them. The names, the casting, and the village setup gives us an honest feeling. But then, the good things end there itself. The multiple characters conflict with the screen time. We see characters coming and disappearing without purpose. It happens in the case of everyone, even the heroines and Jagapathi Babu.We get to see many things happening without purpose. In many places, we feel like we are seeing familiar scenes. Everything becomes predictable and boring. The climax is again a disappointment.Nani is Nani in Tuck Jagadish. He is one actor who excels in comedy and emotional sequences. There is very little comedy in this film and he does justice for the emotions that are needed from him within the character boundaries. There are also some sequences which highlight the heroism in Nani and they are comfortable as well.Skip it."

"," Tuck Jagadish Review, On Amazon Prime Video: An Obvious Family Drama Lifted By Some Brilliant Masala Writing ","From a distance, director Shiva Nirvana's third film (after Ninnu Kori and the much-liked Majili) is a story about blood. On an obvious level, it is about the same blood that's spilled in most big-star Telugu movies, with its slo-mo entry scenes, razor-sharp sickles, flying SUVs and immovable villains. But Tuck Jagdish is far more interested in the other kind of blood-the family kind or at least the kind of blood you're likely to see in a Sooraj Barjatya film. For the most part, this concoction of these two opposite blood types seems forced and manipulative, as though a pure family drama needed the adulteration of action for its star and the box office.Read the full review on Film Companion."

The country is corrupted, crime is very common, it takes years for justice and here they show a guy putting sunglasses doing over acting and fighting evil si comfortably as if enjoying a pizza. Grow up South."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11385078/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","3"," From first scene, it was outdated!!! ","For what nani opted this movie???Old 90's story again and again without any changes. Even Nani cant push up this one. Lost my weekend and time by watching such movie on prime!!!"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11385078/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","1"," Worst movie ","Same old 90's stories. These people who want to behave like reel heroes are zeros in real life. Did anyone ever question any atrocities in real life? And movie is just pathetic. No meaningful to any characters. Waste of time."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11385078/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Feels old, but for a reason ","For those complaining about outdated, If you watched Nanis speech at press meet he very clearly said this movie is not anything new, and this is movie is similar to old family movies that we haven't seen in a long time. So it's like a 90s movie on purpose for nostalgia and family sentiments...all this he clearly said so not sure why people expected something different. Based on that, movie was ok, but missing usual comedy and entertainment from Nani anna. Writing can be better, background score can also be better, but it's still an ok drama movie. Just expect something typical and old and Nostalgic, like The movie makers clearly said, and you may like it."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11385078/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," Nani's one man show ","Typical mass entertainer but with old storyline, it has some brilliant narratives and emotional family moments, which makes it an worthy watch, nani nailed it again with performance."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11385078/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","1"," Please save yourself ","Watch this movie only and only if you have nothing else to do in your life. Just don't waste your time on this."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11385078/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","3"," The year 2012 called, they want their movie back ","I dont know if this was some kind of throwback to the old telugu movies but this one looks old, feels old. Mashup of Mircha and Arvindh Sametha.Pros Nani's performance. Its his show.Cons Cinematography and Music feels dated Cast who aren't given much Disrespect to actress like Aishwarya Rajesh and Ritu Verma Plot inconsistency And plenty of plot holes.Also if Nani and Jagapathi Babu are sons from Naseer's first wife, how come the daughters from his second wife looks older than them."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11385078/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," Below average ","Makers tried for a Ala Vainkuntapuram lo. But Tuck Jagathish is disappointed. Nani catched his screen presence. But the story and script is very outdated. Rithu Varma acted like a hero's dummy in this movie. There is no a challenging role in it. Jagapathy Babu,Devadarshni & Rohini are good. Any way Tuck Jagathish is below average for me."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11385078/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," Nani show ","One of the very few actors who can really act when it comes to emotion, the movie is all about what is happening across, it's a beautiful movie."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11385078/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Would have been superhit in 1990s! ","Watched the movie for Nani's acting and 6 stars for that, else there is nothing left in the movie. The story is million years old, probably director must have found it while digging his old house, it's like zillion years old. Avoid if you can, watch if you have nothing else to do. Nani Ji, please read the script mama.....!"

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11385078/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","2"," Most boring film of my life ","Tge movie is based on thd family village headman concept that we used to see in 1990s and 2000s. But today in this and age one cannot relate to the concept.In the first half, the heros behavior is hard to phatom. Is he aloof, arrogant or lost. The second half is slightly berable after he becomes the MRO.The female leads character is really shallow, except the scene of beating pervert MRO, she barely has any substance.Music is not great with not one catchy song. The editing is really bad with lot of scenes jumping without any context."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11385078/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," Have to be braindead to watch this ","A movie is only as good as the characters that portray it. This movie is a disappointment.Agreed that this story can be made in any era as it will still be relatable but the script should demand a new way of story telling which is missing.Telugu Cinema in a nutshell can be broadly classified into two categories, Entertainment oriented or story/performance oriented. Unfortunately this falls in neither.The cast is so powerful to pull off any kind of performance but i guess the story or the director did not demand any.Music and action sequence did not disappoint and hence earned 5/10 rating.Technically there wasn't any aspect that stood out to be reviewed.I personally would love to see Nani exploring different genres but adding a bit of comedy here and there would not affect the movie and i was disappointed not having seen any in this movie."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11385078/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," Rehash, Predictable and inconsistent ","All the time that we watch the movie, we get a feeling that we might have already seen it somewhere. After giving us two great movies, Shiva Nirvana falters in his third. His strengths emotions are there, but they never carry through the movie due to the screenplay. It feels very formulaic and forced. Nani does what is expected of him and is subtle. Ritu does what she can but is not a memorable role. Aishwarya rajesh has small but substantial role that she lives up to with her acting. Jagapathi babu gets another meaty role and excels. Others get registered here and there and did justice to their roles. Songs never get registered and BGM is a huge minus point. Give it a try for Nani and Jagapathi Babu."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11385078/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," Not for everyone for sure ","Tuck Jagadish wanna be Mahesh Babu's 'Maharshi'- & Junior NTR's 'Aravinda Sametha' but doesn't even stand there. This is just a cheap version of the films that I mentioned above. Same routine Telegu film that you've tired of watching. The movie isn't bad but today's generation it is pretty outdated. Predictable and boring. I'm not saying this movie is bad but it just not everyone's piece of cake. Those who love to watch Indian television dramas would lovr this film but not youngsters."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11385078/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","2"," Outdated movie ","What a terrible movie with the same old plot! Nani has totally lost these days. His move selection has gone terribly awry. There is no proper story or screenplay in this movie. No wonder the producers have gone for OTT release. The movie would have flopped big time had it released in the theatres.@Nani: Please go back to your good old days and make meaningful movies. Not these routine rotten movies."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11385078/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","3"," Wonder how such poor scripts even get made into films ","Nani movies usually attract some attention from viewers. Some are really good but most are at least watchable. The actor himself comes out as someone who is choosy about scripts and uses his acting skills to uplift even average stories.But Tuck Jagadish literally scrapes the bottom of a barrel. Mind numbing twists in the plot. It is hard to understand why violence has to be so raw and illogical. Wafer think plot simply goes on endlessly and aimlessly. Terrible violence makes the movie unwatchable.Just having a catchy title does not help. Middle Class Abbayi (MCA) is also in the same category of an attention seeking title but an appalling script.Hopefully, Nani will recover from this mistake soon and get back with some decent movies."
