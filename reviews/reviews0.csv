Grittier to begin with and Hiroyuki Sanada is one of those guys who automatically lifts the quality of the thing by his presence alone, but then it ends up turning into the usual CGI dominated cheese fest by the climax. They try to make sense of some kind of plot here which is quite excruciating but by the end it's just the usual intercutting of heavily stylised fights between the player characters. Kudos for the copious gore FX and the CGI isn't as bad as it could have been, but I was hoping for more."

After nine victories by Outworld, they are one loss away from the Earth being conquered. Cole Young (Lewis Tan), Sonya Blade (Jessica McNamee), and Liu Kang (Ludi Lin) must defeat the warriors of ruthless Outworld Emperor Shang Tsung (Chin Han).This is a violent, hard-R reboot of the video game adaptation from the 90's. It has scraped off the cheese and speckled on some more action. The special effects are mostly up to date. It's very competent like the competent acting, action, and designs. The story is basic and set up to have more movies in the franchise. Josh Lawson is funny as Kano. The others are less charismatic. The missing ingredient is an A-list actor or an old action star doing a side role cameo. It's an old Hollywood trick but it works. It would give this the illusion of an A-list movie. As it stands, this is a well made B-movie and it's probably enough to continue as a B-movie franchise. Sadly, that road is usually downhill but maybe it could be a long ride."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0293429/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," Mortal Kombat ","Mortal Kombat has been rebooted as a gore laden and a more serious action packed movie.It is surprisingly entertaining but a predictable film. The director makes effective use of some visceral battle fights.It starts off in 17th Century Japan. Bi-Han/Sub-Zero (Joe Taslim) kills the ninja clan led by Hanzo Hasashi/Scorpion. He kills Hanzo as well as his wife and son.Raiden, god of thunder, arrives and takes Hanzo's infant daughter to safety.In the present day. Outworld has defeated Earthrealm in nine of ten tournaments known as Mortal Kombat. If Earthrealm loses the tenth tournament, it can be conquered by Outworld.An ancient prophecy that the blood of Hanzo Hasashi will bring a new generation of Earthrealm's champions. One such person is a former MMA fighter named Cole Young (Lewis Tan.)The movie needed a bit more humour. I thought Kano (Josh Lawson) who provided some of the banter quickly became tiring.The big problem was the lack of a well known star so this really is a B movie fodder. However for a movie based on a computer game franchise, it is still one of the better ones."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0293429/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," And they spelled it wrong ","The film opens in 1607 Japan. Hanzo is killed by Bi-Kan who goes on to become the bad guy Sub-zero (Joe Taslim). Not to be confused with a Batman villain or the guy on "Running Man." Years later descendants of Hanzo and those that might have killed one have the dragon mark. They are the chosen ones of Earth who must fight in the intergalactic contest of "Mortal Kombat". There are three people who have the mark and a fourth (Jessica McNamee toned) who tags along. We know how she will get her mark, but they make us wait for it.There is the standard training scene. This one doesn't have a music montage. They also have certain elemental powers including an eye with a freakin' laser beam. Predictable fare. It builds character which was very secondary to the script.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0293429/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Looking Good Kombat ","Considering the other real life action adaptations of the game ... this is quite a great movie! Now especially the first one was so ridiculous that it was kinda fun. That does not mean you will like it - but hopefully you will like this one. The action is really good (and quite violent just so you know), the acting is also more than solid, which includes script and dialog. Always considering the nature of the movie that is.This is not Shakespeare, this is not meant to have a big story. Bad guys want to destroy the Earth (realm), good guys fight to protect it ... I mean it really is simple as that. The twists and turns can be guessed or seen at least most of the time ... but the movie is entertaining nevertheless. And it looks so good ... not sure how much money they invested, but it was worth it. Yes these movies do not win best cinematography and stuff like that, but that does not mean they cannot have brilliant people as DPs. Maybe I'm exaggerating, but I really enjoyed this one and if you decide to watch this (because you like the genre and/or the games) you will not be dissapointed."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0293429/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," "Pain is the ultimate catalyst." ","With a title like "Mortal Kombat", your expectations should border on the desire to see a fast paced film with plenty of violent martial arts action, so on that score the picture delivers. Story wise, it comes across as pretty standard and predictable, with champions of the Earthrealm battling the forces of Outworld to prevent the world from falling under the evil influence of super baddie Shang Tsung (Chin Han). One thing that took me out of the picture for a moment was when turncoat Kano (Josh Lawson) made reference to David Copperfield in 1617 Japan; where was the film's editor on that one? The picture does suffer from a handful of scenes that are too dark, never a good thing for fight scenes because it's like letting the audience know that what you're looking at couldn't occur in real life. The most gruesome scene for me was when Kung Lao (Max Huang) sliced the vampire winged Nitara (Mel Jarnson) with his bladed helmet, the visual there you don't want to contemplate too long. Over all, this is a fun and fast paced flick for fans of this stuff, but it doesn't get any deeper than that. You'll remember Kano's fireball eye laser as one of the cooler special effects."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0293429/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Finally! This is how Mortal Kombat should be done... ","Granted, I must admit that I was most certainly persuaded to watch the 2021 movie adaptation of the "Mortal Kombat" arcade games, despite of how less than impressive most of the previous attempts at bringing the arcade game to life on the big screen. But the special effects in this 2021 seemed to do the trick, at least in the trailer.And now that I have just watched the 2021 attempt from writers Greg Russo, Dave Callaham, Oren Uziel and Greg Russo. And color me impressed. This 2021 "Mortal Kombat" is how the very first "Mortal Kombat" movie should have been. And this particular movie from director Simon McQuoid makes you want to forget about ever having suffered from previous attempts of "Mortal Kombat" with the likes of Christopher Lambert and Brian Thompson on the cast lists.Sure, the storyline told in the 2021 "Mortal Kombat" was pretty simplistic, as they have essentially always been in these movies, as they are movies based on an arcade game. Let's face it, there isn't really much of any in-depth deeper storytelling needed here. It is fighting, pure and simple.Joe Taslim and Hiroyuki Sanada are phenomenally cast for the roles of Bi-Han/Sub-Zero and Hanzo Hasashi/Scorpion respectively. And aside from these two mammoth action stars, then it was really, really refreshing to see that they opted to cast mostly unfamiliar talents for the roles in this movie. That made me very happy, because it was so good to see fresh and new faces to portray these characters, so the older and more dubious performances could be put away for good."Mortal Kombat" is, surprise surprise, a martial arts fighting and action movie. There isn't any profound storyline here, but of course that should come as no surprise when you sit down to watch a movie such as the 2021 "Mortal Kombat" movie.Visually then the special effects and CGI people working on "Mortal Kombat" worked wonders. The visual effects were spectacular and the CGI was spot on. These effects really made a world of difference for a movie such as this. And it was so nice to see proper effects in a "Mortal Kombat" movie after all these years.Sure, I haven't played "Mortal Kombat" for many years, so some of the characters in the storyline here in this 2021 movie were total strangers to me. Not that it really made a whole lot of difference to the overall enjoyment of the movie though.And I do enjoy how they aren't afraid to kill off characters in these movies.I will say that director Simon McQuoid managed to direct a proper movie here with this particular addition to the "Mortal Kombat" franchise. And this is without a doubt a movie that is well worth taking the time and effort to sit down and watch.This was a movie that properly entertained me, and I was enjoying it from beginning to end. As such, I am rating the 2021 "Mortal Kombat" a well-deserved seven out of ten stars. This 2021 movie is a fresh start for the "Mortal Kombat" movie franchise, and let's just pretend all the previous ones actually were just a fever-induced bad dream."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0293429/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," I'm the audience for this ","'ve seen so many reviews of this movie that seem to take great enjoyment making fun of it and saying things like, "Who cares about a Mortal Kombat movie?"Well, I do. I'm the exact audience for this movie, someone who fell in love with the game, saw both of the original films in the theater and have purchased more than my fair share of the multiple sequels and all the DLC that goes with them.So while these holier than thou critics snicker their way through their reviews, please know that this is someone hoping Stryker would show up and someone that grinded to get multiple Scorpion outfits in Mortal Kombat 11.That means that when I mention all the moments why this movie didn't work, it's with sadness.That's because I've been waiting - as have many fans of the game - for this movie for a long time.And this isn't what I was waiting for.Now, there's the blood and gore that some see as the true heart of Mortal Kombat, but for me, the true joy of the games is the opportunity to be part of a wuxia movie. That would seem to be an incredibly simple idea to take and make a movie of - hey, they did it right the first time - and yet, this doesn't seem to do it.Yes, the Mortal Kombat tournament doesn't happen in every game, but the story has always revolved around it. Much like every shared universe attempt, this is a movie trying to make the sequel instead of worrying about making the first movie rock.The other critical error this movie makes is that outdated thought that we need a set of human eyes to view these events through, someone we can relate to. That would be Cole Young, a struggling MMA artist who has a family bloodline that ties to Scorpion. This is also kind of like how old comics thought that I needed a child sidekick to better identify with Batman. Nope. I'm just fine with wanting to be the hero and even better with unworldly characters that allow me to escape the world of normlacy.Speaking of the gray ordinary world, this movie seems content to have the action take place outside a farmhouse than taking us to the Outworld or really anywhere that isn't drab. Look, I'm not expecting this to be Zu: Warriors from the Magic Mountain, but come on. The beginning at least flirts with bright colors and great fighting. And then...That said, I kind of liked that Tadanobu Asano - Kakihara from Ichi the Killer - was Raiden, even if he doesn't get all that much to do. Josh Lawson's Kano is one of the few other bright spots, even if this version just has a red eye and isn't a cyborg. And I'm always happy to see Kabal.But you know, the first film in what may be a new series gets rid of Goro and Sub-Zero before we even get to the tournament, while tickling us with a mention of Johnny Cage. It's the inverse of Patton Oswald's joke about the Star Wars prequels - "Don't show me how the things I love started, show me the things I love!" - and like some weird edging thing where they withhold the sure thing in the hopes of getting you to care more about a movie that might never get made instead of the one you paid to watch."

Lewis Tan take the top billing as "Cole" an young MMA fighter who tries to establish a fearsome band of suitably skilled champions who are going to have to join him against the evil Cryomancer and, yep - you've guessed it - save the universe... Indeed, if you have a dragon mark anywhere on your body, I'd lock all the doors and get under that duvet - else you might find yourself drafted in too! The effects are great, but not particularly special - it is an high standard that we all expect nowadays, so they don't really stand out. The dialogue is neither here nor there and the fight scenes are such as we have seen many, many times before... It's not rubbish, and perhaps now we have the establishing film out of the way, we can focus a little more on a more solid and interesting story for the characters to play out.

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0293429/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Better than the first movie, but less fun ","If you are a fan of Mortal Kombat you played the original game and then every version you got your hands on until now and also watched the movies and the TV series and are curious about how this compares. Well, I am happy to say that it is a good Mortal Kombat film, balancing character development and action pretty well. However, it has to adapt to the times, meaning that the characters are inspired from multiple versions of the games and the R rating is there only to show some scenes that are inspired by the 3D fatalities in the games and less about actual emotional violence, subtlety or real violence. Also, I am afraid to say, the acting is not that good in some cases. The plot makes sense, but there are some scenes in it that don't, like people accepting Cole as the leader or him understanding what the hell Hanzo says in Japanese and the bad guys leaving their targets alive for no reason. Compared to the 1997 film, it is much better, but also less entertaining. Gone are the goofy quips of the actors, replaced with a kind of rushed intensity, like all the characters know they are in a movie and work together to hurry it along.Let's start with the characters. You get Cole Young as the main character, a good fighter, but completely unaware of the Mortal Kombat universe as well as his lineage descending directly from Scorpion. He is a completely new character, not found in the games. You get Sub Zero, he is the big baddie and working for Shang Tsung, and a bit of Scorpion. Then there is Liu Kang, can't avoid him, together with Kung Lao. And finally the (love?) triangle Sonya, Kano and Jax. Then there are the fighters for Shang Tsung: Sub-Zero, Kabal, Mileena, Nitara, Reiko and CGI Reptile and Goro. Characterization-wise, only Cole, Sonya and Kano get anything like a character arc. Jax, Liu Kang and Kung Lao follow, then the other characters getting a random basic backstory and quick demise.I am a fan of Joe Taslim since I've seen him in Fighter and he did a terrifying Sub-Zero. It was kind of funny to see him defeated by Lewis Tan and Hiroyuki Sanada, though. Josh Lawson absolutely stole the show with his interpretation of sociopathic Kano. I liked Mehcad Brooks as Jax, he really changed his appearance for the role and trained a lot. Goro was ridiculous and also kind of pointless. They wasted a lot of CGI to just kill the character off. As I said, they made a good trade off between story and action, but most of the other characters were short lived, especially the baddies. I was most disappointed with Mileena, which is one of my favourite characters and a really brutal fighter with a huge game history, but in this film she's just a little girl with anger issues. Nitara and Reiko have a few scenes and then dies off. I thought Kabal was real interesting and well played by Daniel Nelson. Sonya was also one of my favourites, especially in the early games, but I can't say I was impressed by Jessica McNamee. Also Raiden... Tadanobu Asano is a decent actor, but he was crap in this.The more interesting bit of the film for me is that it's clearly a beginning, not an end. Imagine that in the story of this film there actually wasn't any tournament! It all happens before the tournament even starts. So if this is a success, which I certainly hope, they have enough time to get the feedback from fans and adapt for the sequel(s). Personally I think that Mortal Kombat has such a deep lore that it is perfect for a TV series rather than for a bunch of films. Perhaps they will go that way, who knows. Also, the games always grouped the characters in small units: Scorpion and Sub-Zero, Sonya, Jax and Kano, Shao Kahn, Kitana and Mileena, etc. I think a really good MK movie would just take one of these subgroups of characters and expand their story as part of the larger Mortal Kombat universe. Go, MKEU!Bottom line: great acting job for Sub-Zero and Kano and a bit Kabal, great preparation for Jax, good job on balancing story and action, but the rest could have been better. Two hours is way too little for any comprehensive Mortal Kombat story. Next time either go with a TV series or with episodic films, covering just a few characters."

Other than subzero and scorpion, the acting is awful. Like really really bad. Every line or facial expression given by sonya blade is laughable. And the guy playing reiko had a tiny part, but every scene he was in, omg, he had the stupidest hammiest over-the-top facial expressions i've ever seen. (he played rictus erectus!? Lol)the dialogue was terrible, the story was nonsense. Pacing is bad, no flow at all. But the worst part, so much of the fighting was terrible, poorly shot, switching between different fights, and mostly unclear. Why????

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0293429/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Get over here and watch this; it's dumb but fun. ","Perhaps fittingly, 'Mortal Kombat (2021)' feels like something straight out of the nineties - it's arguably more of a direct remake of 'Mortal Kombat (1995)' than an adaptation of its source video-game franchise. It's colourful, chaotic and even a bit camp; it's silly but it knows it, emulating the feeling of playing the fighting game with friends rather than the feeling of being engaged in brutal, to-the-death bouts against vicious, otherworldly opponents. Fans of the games will find plenty of enjoyment here (don't ask me why, but hearing someone say "fatality" or "flawless victory" after a recognisable kill is oddly satisfying), even if some elements have been adapted in slightly strange - and, I suppose, 'unfaithful' - ways for no real reason. I don't mind the created character of Cole, since he serves as protagonist and does a decent job of driving the story forward, but he isn't all that interesting - nobody is, to be honest - and he doesn't really fit with the more classically adapted elements. The most engaging character is probably Kano because he chews every scene he's in; others, like Raiden and Shang Tsung, are just flat-out flat. The picture is oddly small in scope and some (not all) of its supernatural elements - such as outworld, for example - are actually rather boring, aesthetically speaking. The whole thing feels a bit inconsequential, too; although it does feature several instances of decidedly mortal combat, it doesn't actually get around to portraying its eponymous tournament. It's almost like set-up for a potential future film. While I certainly hope that film will come, it doesn't feel great to have sat through something that essentially acts as a prelude. Still, it isn't a waste of time. Despite its issues, it's actually a ton of fun. The story is essentially an excuse to get its stars involved in one-on-one bouts with one another and make references to their video-game counterparts. The action, save for a couple of odd edits (including one that literally seems like an overlooked mistake), is well-choreographed and energetic, typically making good use of its characters' varying skill sets. The players feel a tad invincible at times (until they're killed, of course), but that's sort of in keeping with the source material because the combatants just keep going until the fight is done, no matter how much potentially fatal - or, at least, incapacitating - damage they take (such as broken bones, ruptured spleens and busted testicles). The picture has its share of fatalities, most of which are recognisable to franchise fans, and it renders them in an appropriately violent way, even though the gore isn't gross so much as (as odd as it seems) crowd-pleasing. Like I said, it's fun. It definitely has its problems and, as entertaining as they are, its fights aren't the "greatest fight scenes ever put to screen" as its director once claimed, but the flick is fast-paced and enjoyable right the way through. It doesn't take itself too seriously and it never even comes close to being boring. Though imperfect, it's a solid effort. It's especially good for a video-game movie; in fact, it's one of the best video-game movies I've seen. 6/10."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0293429/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," better than expected ","I was expecting absolutely no plot, but we actually get a small one. It seems it's time for the Earthrealm fighters and Outworld fighters to square off. Outworld has won 9 times in a row and if wins again will take over Earth. So not only do the fighters have to save themselves, they must also save mankind. Sub zero beings to hunt down Cole, whose ancester was Scorpion. Jax and Sonya Blade hunt him down and tell him about the Mortal Kombat tournament. Sonya has captured Kano whom has the mark of the dragon like Cole and Jax. From there, they go to the temple of Raiden to seek training and learn their secret powers. Shang Tsung tries to cheat by engaging in combat before the tournament, so all our characters end up taking each other on. We get some good fights and gore( not very realistic) but still cool. Scorpion shows up at the end and breathes fire, cool. I think you need to know something about the video game and its characters to really enjoy this movie.FINAL VERDICT: If you like the video game, I think you will like this. You can still enjoy the fights if you don't know much about the game. Worth a view."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0293429/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Get over here! It's time to talk about Mortal Kombat. Is it a movie worth watching? Kinda. ","Honestly while not a flawless victory, this fantasy martial arts adaptation of a 1990s fighting arcade game was not horrible. Like the original PG-13 1995 & 1997 movies, this 2021 reboot also adapted in and out franchise story elements. With the results being that the visuals are too extremely gory. Because of that, this flick came very close to getting an NC-17 title by the MPA. Instead, it got a Rated R rating. With that, this film's gruesomely kills are a lot more memorable than the previous movies big time. Even with all the quick cuts from director Simon McQuoid and his crew, the fights perform by the legit martial artists honestly lives up to the bloody fatalities of the game; along with the somewhat silly unnatural special effects, listenable music and semi beautiful cinematographic backdrops. However, the previous ones do establish the underground fighting tournament for control the Earthrealm a lot better by showing it. Here the movie explains the lore in a quick spill badly execution black screen text scene, follow by a repetitive exposition dump from a character with little history of witnessing the tournament, firsthand. You would think that Earth God defender Raiden (Tadanobu Asano), would be that story teller yet it's given to Sonya Blade (Jessica McNamee). Nevertheless, the tournament never really does starts in this movie. This film instead establishes that sorcerer Shang Tsung (Chin Han) who has overseen the last nine victories loves to cheat by taking out the Earthrealm's champions before the fights starts. All of this doesn't make any sense; seeing how the tournament is there to stop Outworld from conquering Earth. Yet they could enter easily and freely into that world at anytime and anywhere to interfere with the God of Thunder's fighters. Honestly what's really stopping them from conquering the world all through. Another thing if Raiden could take his fighters to the endless void, a neutral world to escape the villains. I really don't get why his crew wouldn't train there until the tournament starts or the Elder Gods find out on Tsung's scheme. A lot of this film's conflict could easily be resolved with his teleporting powers. The movie never makes it clear what Raiden could and couldn't interfere with and why he couldn't just banish Tsung all right. I really got lost in the lack of logic of the plot because of him. It sucks because Asano does look the part, but he doesn't have the natural charisma or gravitas of that of the previous actor Christopher Lambert to keep me entertain to overlook the big jarring flaws of that character. This version of Raiden is also a jerk with his bemoaning and insulting attitude. Not fun to be around. The film makes it hard to believe that he cares about Earth. Another thing that the original flick has over this, was its protagonist. Instead of having original video game characters like Liu Kang (Ludi Lin) take the helm. This supernatural martial arts film written by Greg Russo and Dave Callaham goes in another direction by following a studio mandated new character Cole Young (Lewis Tan), a somewhat mediocre mixed martial arts fighter who quite dull and boring as the chosen one. It's really hard to root for Young as an underdog because how dumb and reckless the story makes the character be. It's quite stupid to rage quit and go back to his family when the threats are still happening. He pretty much put his wife and daughter in danger on purpose. Plus, he doesn't even evolve into Scorpion like the story makes it out to be. Instead, his new gain powers are kinda lame. Think of a punching bag mixed with Wing Chun wooden dummy and you got what he turns out to be. Nonetheless I kinda do understand why he has those magic based powers due to feeble Earth realm individual traits being enhance for the tournament such in the technology or cybernetic case of Mehcad Brooks' Jax's metal arms and Josh Lawson' Kano's eye. Since Cole is always in the meager defense. It made sense for him to have a literal plot armor. Still, I kinda wish he had more of a fighting spirit. The character always getting his butt beaten or having another character save him at the last minute. He made out to look so weak. That's not how you build up a hero at all. The movie would probably work better as a revenge story if they kept the establishing character Hanzo Hasashi/Scorpion (Hiroyuki Sanada) as the lead. I kinda like the Edo period Jidaigeki Chanbara opening with him versus Bi-Han/Sub-Zero (Joe Taslim). Still kinda wish they establish why they were fighting with each other. Nevertheless, there was a lot of material that they could had gone with Hanzo after that fight, such as showing how he gain his demonic powers and the conflict that comes with it, like choosing to defend the Earthrealm for his daughter or join the forces of the Outworld for his soul. Sadly, that character doesn't show back up until the final few minutes of the end without much exposition. Nevertheless, it was still badass to see him fight his rival once again. Love Joe Taslim as Sub-Zero. Sorry for the pun, but he was chilling. Very menacing. As for the other antagonists. The performances needed a little work even with Lawson being somewhat a memorable comic relief as Kano. Nonetheless, I do get why the filmmakers chosen to showcase some of the lesser-known villains from the franchise. Can't have ultimate baddie Shao Kahn died in the first movie. The same with the heroes. Glad they kinda hint that other characters like Nightwolf, Johnny Cage and others might be coming soon. That would be nice to witness. Overall: While not truly toasty. This reboot still worth a watch both in theaters and on HBO Max. So, check the movie out."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0293429/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," A Good Way to Waste Some Time ","I've probably played this game a couple of times in the past, but I have never really been all that interested in what I term as beat-em-ups. Then again Mortal Kombat, back in the days, or at least back in the days of the video arcade, was one of those classic games, probably because at the time of its release it was pushing the boundaries of what could be done. Also, they have released eleven versions of the game (which usually means that they have been upgraded for the next generation console), and I have to admit that they do bring in new characters. However, the characters in this movie all come from the original game.Honestly, there isn't much in this film that differs it from many of the other films that I've seen, though I guess it is certainly better than a lot of the rubbish that had been hitting our screens of late. Yeah, this is definitely not one of those straight to Netflix types of films, but it certainly isn't going to be winning any awards either (though I might eat my words down the track).The story is about these realms that engage in periodic tournaments, not that there is actually any tournament in the film, but rather people with super powers beating each other up. We have the outworld, which are the bad guys, and we have Earth, which are the good guys. Anyway, centuries ago this guy named Hanzo, who happens to be a martial arts master, got into a fight with another dude named Bi Han who has this ability to shoot ice out of his hands. Anyway, Bi-Han kills Hanzo and his family, but Hanzo's daughter manages to escape, and from her comes a line of martial artists.Fast forward to the present time we have Cole Young, a descendant of Hanzo, and also a street fighter, though he isn't particularly good any more. Unfortunately, it seems that Bi-Han, who now goes by the name of Sub-Zero, has decided that they will go and kill all of the competitors from Earth so that they win the tournament by default, and as such end up taking Earth for their own. As you can probably guess, we then have a section of the film where they are training, and then they go after the bad guys, and you can probably guess what the ending is going to be.Yeah, it was okay, what you would basically call a popcorn flick. Mind you, they do have some laughs, especially with the Australian (or who I assume is Australian based on the accent, though the accent does happen to be particularly thick). Mind you, he was a pretty cool character, and they certainly did well with the laughs. However, in the end it isn't anything that is particularly flash, but it still is an enjoyable watch, and is certainly much better than a lot of the rubbish I've seen of late."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0293429/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," its for the... ","Kids and grownups in somekinda combatmode that this film invites, not a grumpy old man. I think its far too unfinished on the special effects, it will become a comedy gem in 2050 due to bad visual motions, like monster movies made in the19 50's and 60's, watched and smiled over in 2010.Some funny acts, by a surtain aussie with beard, the rest is just pounting at eachother, or cut and slice and grind under the influence of humungous sound effects and musical score volume. Otherwise its dead on new ideas, you can sense everyones next move, and with ''two-in-one''- monsters(broadbacked and handy as metoo) , others with a ''jonas''-mask( not the friday 13th kind, its the one for coldasthma patients, skiers, skaters, parachuters etc) or tight nostrils due to icesickles in every joint and others with a shraply edged toilett bed pan on the head aint scary.So its just a weak 5 with just a small recommend, its entertainment for the multitasking generation, not for a ''count one finger at the time''-guy like miself."

","I don't know what the deal is for a video game adaption this Mortal Kombat is the closet thing to accurate in my opinion. Got to see this in RPX which is an exhilarating theater experience glad I didn't watch on HBO it wouldn't have been as epic! I absolutely love how brutal the fights/murder scenes were. Some of my reviews don't get enough appreciation so at least take the positivity from me."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0293429/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Now that's entertainment! ","Based on the video game franchise, 'Mortal Kombat' has the age old premise: world domination. This high fantasy action adventure film will no doubt have a limited audience: those who enjoy fantasy movies, and those who enjoy martial arts.While I'm not a martial arts fan, I must admit the fight scenes were incredibly well done. They are fast, brutal and bloody and extremely well choreographed. There was maybe a bit too much fighting for my liking, but I nevertheless still enjoyed the movie.So, we have a bunch of unlikely heroes who must save Earth from the ruler of Outworld, the soul sucker Shang Tsung. The ultimate villain, though, is Bi-Han, or Sub-Zero. His scenes were by far the film's best scenes - especially when he first arrives on Earth in search of fighter Cole (Lewis Tan). The visual effects are jaw-dropping! The no holds barred action sequences are fast-paced and exciting. The film also has a very good score.Although Cole is the film's main protagonist, my favorite character was Kano (Josh Lawson), simply because his character was so different from all the others. He is rude, bombastic, arrogant, and has no sense of ethics, morals, or discretion.There are some plot flaws but being high fantasy they can easily be overlooked. I found 'Mortal Kombat' more entertaining than other high profile superhero movies like 'The Avengers' series and the new Spider-Man movies starring Tom Holland. 'Mortal Kombat' was pure entertainment from beginning to end. And the film ends with the door wide open for a sequel. This is a film I'll watch again and again, even if purely for the stunning visuals and amazing action sequences."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0326716/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","2"," Worthy effort but never should have been released in theaters ","There are two ways to review this movie. On the one hand, it is obviously a labor of love, and you have to admire director Patrick Johnson's persistence. He worked for 13 years to get this project completed. So I have to give him an A for effort. It's amazing that an amateur filmmaker was able to bring his film to the big screen. This is a worthy "student film", but it is what it is, and it should never have been released in theaters. Everything about it is amateurish, including the acting, the directing, the script, and the cinematography. For example, the director seems to think that having one of the actors stare into the camera with his mouth open for 10 seconds is high drama (and he uses this technique repeatedly). I'm not saying that there is no audience for this movie. I'm guessing that sci-fi geek's, Star Wars fanatics, and amateur filmmakers will enjoy it despite its flaws. But it should have gone straight to DVD and streaming. I felt ripped off having to pay eight bucks to see it."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0326716/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","2"," A Frenetic Mess ","Ostensibly, 5-25-77 is a coming of age story regarding the filmmaking aspirations of its lead character, Patrick. And if that's all it tried to be, it might have been an excellent film.There are so many subplots that the movie is nearly incoherent. Only a couple of these subplots wrap up. Many are seemingly dropped, and one or two don't even properly begin... they're just somehow there. Technical issues aside (and there are a lot of them), the narrative never seems to find its rhythm. By the end of the film, it's trying to be about love and finding oneself, but Patrick begins the film already seeming to know who he is. The rest is filler. Literally.There is a very good sequence when Patrick visits Hollywood, but it's not enough to save the movie.The editing is horrible, almost nonsensical. It's as though the filmmakers concentrated on six minutes at a time, without once giving thought to how those six minutes connect with the rest of the film.The use of music in scenes is among the worst uses of music I've ever witnessed. In an early scene, the mix is so bad you can barely hear the characters talking. In a later scene that - if silent - would have been a beautiful, poignant moment, silly music instead up-ends the scene to the point of an eye-roll.And the story? Well, were it not for the characters telling you what was going on at any given time, you wouldn't have a clue what it was.I so very much wanted to like this film, but I so very much do not.Several friends of mine have seen shorter versions (the one I watched was around 2 hours and 15 minutes), and they all speak highly of those shorter cuts. I'd be curious to watch them, but you couldn't pay me to sit through this one again. It hurt to watch."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0326716/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," superb coming-of-age story ","This film was shown at my local art-house theater tonight, and it far exceeded my expectations - I'd seen an earlier version a few years ago and really didn't know what to expect. This is an indie gem, a coming- of-age tale built around the release of the first Star Wars film on May 25, 1977. The filmmaker weaves the lead character's lovable, laughable attempts at Super-8 filmmaking into his high school loves and losses and his breakthrough experiences with other films of the era in a way that is engaging, entertaining and thought-provoking from start to finish. The actors are terrific and very professional, the attention to detail is outstanding, and the production values are top notch. Highly recommended."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0326716/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," Star Wars + Super8 Films + Alan Parsons Project + 1970's = well...me! ","Disclaimer: This movie strikes a very personal chord with me so I doubt this will be at all helpful to others. Sorry 'bout that.5-25-77 is an important date for sure. I can't thank Patrick Read Johnson enough for sharing this bio-pic of his life, which hits many of the same notes of my own childhood as well (told you it was personal). When I heard about this movie I couldn't wait to see it, and I was not disappointed!I'll hold my personal stories a moment to say that I thoroughly enjoyed going along on this young geek's life journey - all the way to ILM and back! It was a very personal story, full of heart and humor, honest angst and self doubt. The movie, though top quality, maintains a wonderfully "homemade" feel throughout, right through the credits. It boasts a terrific cast of actors for sure! Colleen Camp was simply fierce as Pat's mom! :-)So here goes Even though my own Super8 filmmaking began just after Star Wars was released and spanned my wonder years, 12-18, leading up to a career in television, there were many moments throughout 5-25-77 that resonated perfectly with my own childhood. From the Testor paints and plastic model kits (the same models I had!) , to the bedroom movie posters (same 2001 poster!), to the "friends and family" backyard Super 8 productions, it was all spot on for me growing up in a similar small town in Florida.When I heard those awesome Alan Parsons Project tunes peppered throughout I was grinning ear-to-ear, as they are my jam (as not-cool people say trying to sound cool)! Although my own "love life" at that young age was all G-rated, I too had a first crush moment tied to a movie-date of Star Wars which, unfortunately for her (?), I was more smitten with at the time. (sigh)Alas, there was only a single showing on a single day, but I hope to be able to see 5-25-77 again (and soon!) because I know there were many more "dj vu" moments that I just can't recollect now. This was simply a wonderful movie experience, allowing me to relive my youthful Super8 hijinks which, in my own mind, were every bit as adventurous as Mr. Johnsons. And although I never made it to Hollywood, my filmmaking buddies and I DID get our 1982 stop-motion magnum opus "Too Much Star Wars" delivered directly to Lucasfilm to become part of their fan-film archives, and received a nerdily epic letter on Lucasfilm stationary in return. (yes, it's framed on my wall)5-25-77 forever!!"

However, I do and I enjoyed WITHOUT REMORSE, for what it's worth. It's a good addition to the Tom Clancy adaptations out there, not as good as the Harrison Ford classics from the 1990s, but better than some since. The plot is cliched for sure but filled with drama and incident, and the action is well directed with big set-pieces that impress throughout. A popcorn film for sure, but tasty with it."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0499097/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," Without Remorse ","Many years ago I read Without Remorse on holiday. I thought it was a cross between Death Wish and American Gangster.This movie adaptation has been in the works since the mid 1990s. Willem Dafoe played John Clark in Clear and Present Danger in 1994. He is too old to play Clark now.This version only has Tom Clancy and Without Remorse in common with the novel.US Navy SEAL John Kelly (Michael B Jordan) is on the hunt of a Russian team that killed his wife and his former SEAL colleagues.Kelly suspects that there is a conspiracy that goes right to the higher echelons of the American government.This is a formulaic and rather cheap looking movie.It has enough action adventure to make it average. Jordan is just ok as the lead although I felt he looked a little bored.The whole movie takes place in third gear and the story is preposterous."

Kelly is no John Wick with a dead puppy but he demands answers.We knew the killings were going to come home. While it doesn't mention any president by name, which one would allow Russians to kill Americans unscathed? The whole payback payback thing was poorly done. Michael B.

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0499097/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," "A big country needs big enemies." ","I'll take it on faith from John Clancy fans that this film had very little to do with the book of the same name, except for the names of principal characters. My fault with the film is the obtuse writing and as at least one reviewer pointed out, scenes so dark you can't tell what happened in them, only to find out later in the story. It pretty much boils down to operatives in both the CIA and it's Russian counterpart attempting to foment war with the other side, for reasons not really made clear except to keep tensions among the world powers going. Soldier John Kelly (Michael B. Jordan) comes to that realization when he eventually meets up with his Russian opposite Rykov (Brett Gelman), who had a much better handle on the state of affairs between their respective agencies. The story is wrapped around Kelly's need to seek vengeance for the murder of his wife (Lauren London) and unborn child, but the revenge motive tends to get buried in the confusing story line along the way. I don't think a second viewing would clear things up all that much."

","It is shameful that I am forced to put a rate - a minimum of stars - because this movie doesn't deserve any one. This is a disgrace for a gifted director such a Stefano Sollima, the son of the great Sergio, to provide such a crap, a straight to DVD product, though an agreeable time waster. I would have never bet a cent that such a great film maker would do this to us. I am not sure to remind it before supper, my brain.soft - hard - ware is programmed.to erase such junk stuff. Anyway with Tom Clancy,there is the eternal issue, the eternal good guys vs the bad guys. OK that's very accurate, documented, interesting for those craving for espionnage and strategy, intelligent world and action thrillers in the same time. But there are unfortunately too many clichs. Forgive me if I have.digressed a bit on Tom Clancy's books. I will only say I prefer Frederick Forsyth's ones, another master in the genre, but with not the same clichs."

Jordan and have always liked (despite some of his more curious roles) Jamie Bell, but somehow neither of them - nor co-star Jodie Turner-Smith - can set this apart from a plethora of mediocre tech-thrillers. The former is "Kelly", a man whose heavily pregnant wife is murdered, ostensibly, by some Russian drugs dealers in revenge for a previous SEAL mission he undertook. He survives the same lethal attack, barely, and soon hooks up with the other two on a top secret mission that might just end up thwarting a conflagration of global proportions. Question is - well, just who is pulling the strings? Answer is - we can guess that from pretty much the first ten minutes so what we are left with is quite an entertaining, admittedly, collection of set piece action scenes with loads of planes crashing, bombs going off, snipers, pyrotechnics - indeed pretty much everything you can imagine before an ending that is just plain rotten. It has sequel written all over it, but given the writing has nothing at all of the Tom Clancy about it aside from his characterisations, I suspect that would merely be another unremarkable outing from actors who have much more to offer than this derivative stuff. It isn't terrible to watch, but I dare you to not start doing something else whilst it is on..."

It just didn't do anything for me. It did a bad job of getting me invested in the story or the characters. The parts that are supposed to be intense didn't make me feel the stakes or any kind of suspense. The longer the movie went on, the less i cared about what happens in the story or to the characters. And the action is mediocre.Actually i do have a specific complaint. So many parts of the movie are sloppy in the sense that the viewer is not sure what's happening in a scene. I'm not talking about shaky-cam/quick-cut fight scenes. They just did a bad job of producing a continuous flow that a viewer can follow. And a lot of the scenes were so dark. On more than one occasion i didn't know who was fighting who or which character was shot. No wonder i stopped caring. Fail.I came back after finishing the review because i remembered a couple more things. Maybe i just checked out early causing me to forget. But the dialogue is atrocious. And there is an "ah ha" moment that makes zero sense. To keep it vague, it's okay if a specific person dies.

Jordan) is glad to return home to be with his pregnant wife Pam (Lauren London) and settle down for a bit. However, his happiness is short lived, when Pam and his unborn child are killed, and he narrowly survives a home invasion. In his quest for justice, he encounters obstruction from top brass Secretary Clay (Guy Pearce) and Robert Ritter (Jamie Bell), but with the help of friend and fellow SEAL Karen (Jodie Turner-Smith) he heads to Russia to take revenge. Kelly is sprung from jail for this to lead a special operation, where he learns there is more behind his family's death than meets the eye.In the absence of anything else more appealing to watch on Saturday night, Amazon Prime offered up this effort, promoting itself as an adaptation of one of the late author Tom Clancy's work, but with a standard, formulaic revenge plot line that would serve well in an average Steven Seagal film. And indeed, it mostly plays out this way, with the standard dull, grey lighting and humourless script that is the order of the day these days.In the lead role, Jordan fits the bill as a muscular action hero and has an effective presence, with decent support from co star Turner-Smith, with whom he shares a convincing chemistry. In more background roles, established stars Bell and Pearce are well cast as shady military brass with more of a stake in the proceedings as events roll on, and the plot becomes more intricate and interwoven, with some unexpected twists and red herrings thrown up to keep it interesting.Well made and intelligent enough to hold your attention, but ultimately pretty perfunctory and workmanlike, and without laughs, so it won't linger in your memory long after you've seen it. ***"

It doesn't matter that there's the military, espionage and geopolitical conspiracies involved in the Tom Clancy variation on the formula; it's always the same thing. The baddie and his red herring are so obvious that one of them might as well be wearing a black hat. But, sure, the action is standard, if darkly lit, and Michael B. Jordan fits the part of a muscular star to recognizably pose between the rest of the interchangeable tropes. Maybe you'll even find "Without Remorse" a bit fun with him not playing by the rules, out for revenge as he is. For crying out loud, we even get a mid-credits scene setting up a franchise.When a movie is this dull, I start desperately looking for something to be worth my attention. One character makes a point regarding the Cold War having brought Americans together, whereas now without a common enemy one half sees the other half as the enemy. That comes too late to matter, though. There's also the business of Jordan's character telling his enemies to say his murdered wife's name. That got me thinking about the SayHerName campaign, but the picture doesn't do anything with its star being an African American, and in one sequence he takes out an entire squad of Russian police officers who are just doing their jobs.

So i was open minded before watching this movie and the only thing i read was that it got mainly negative reviews from critics and i saw a low score of 5.8 here on IMDb.All that put aside, i highly enjoyed this movie for what it was - a very skilfull made 2 hours long action thriller. I loved music in it, directing was superb and acting by Michael and Guy was excellent - as usual. I liked the story as well as this world created here - i would definitely like to see a sequel.

","5 out of 5 stars.Tom Clancys Without Remorse is an awesome action thriller film. About an Navy seal John Kerry ( Michael B. Jordan) after a mission that didnt seem right. When his team is assassinated and his wife is murdered. And he is left for dead. He goes on a revenge spree to track down on who set them up. Which unravels a conspiracy which he can not trust anyone.Great plot. I never read the Tom Clancy novel. So i would not know how close or different the novel is to the movie. The plot was great. It did not fall in a too political conspiracy category. Besides the idea that there may be a cover up within the CIA. Or a plot that is setting one up for a bigger consequence. There is a twist that seemed predictable.The direction is fast paced. It is one hell of a thrill ride. Throwing in a espionage world with John and a team who are highly skilled on how they operate. The action sequences are plenty. And exciting. Lots of shoot em up action. That makes this film entertaining.The cast ensemble is great too. Michael B. Jordan nails the character John Clark. Going rogue to find out who murdered his wife. And will stop at nothing.I say this is one of the better Tom Clancys films. Which the other films were too political with there plot devices. The movie is gritty. Violent and on the edge thrill ride.Overall, it is one action packed thriller that never slows down. While setting up for a sequel for another mission for John Clark. Which Michael B. Jordan might be creating a new franchise."

Except that it turns out that the hostage is held by Russians, not Syrians... We then go to "Washington, DC, 3 months later" and our hero John Kelly is at a bbq cookout with his highly pregnant wife. In a parallel story, two other SEAL members of that Aleppo mission are viciously murdered... At this point we are 10 min. Into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest film adaptation of a Tom Clancy novel. Let's be clear: the production team went all out with this, and money seemingly was no object. But does that make for a good film? The film is directed by Stefano Sollima, whose previous work includes "Sicario 2". Most importantly, the film stars Michael B. Jordan ("Creed", among many others), and he is in great form throughout. The film brings a nice mix of all-out action scenes and some calmer moments, and also a good number of plot twists (who is really the bad guy here? You might be surprised!). The production sets are top notch. And the original score is from none other than Jonsi (of Sigur Ros). Bottom line: this movie just flew by in no time, and I found it surprisingly entertaining, even if the plot ultimately is rather conventional if not predictable. Frankly, I don't understand the many, many outright negative reviews of this on here. Were you not entertained by this film? I know I was."Without Remorse" was supposed to open in theaters last summer, but a little thing called COVID-19 had other plans, and hence the release of this big budget film (like most others) was delayed and delayed, and ultimately Amazon Studios stepped in and bought the distribution rights. The film was just released on Prime Video (where I saw it) and here on Amazon Instant Video. If you are in the mood for a mindless and entertaining Tom Clancy movie, or simply are a fan of Michael B.

The premise of the film sees an elite soldier go on the hunt after his wife is killed.Main Character Over the last few years Michael B Jordan has become a real film star and that shows here as he manages to add a little bit to this completely bland character. Jordan just has the presence of a movie star and it is sometimes exciting to see him take down bad guys are here. But the issue is that this character is incredibly dull and boring, I never once cared about him and his motivations despite the fact I clearly should. A weaker actor then Jordan would have been totally useless but he manages to save it a little bit.Supporting Characters This film has an impressive supporting cast. Jodie Turner-Smith, Jamie Bell & Guy Pearce are in the film and it feels very similar to the main character in that these actors do a decent job in their roles but their characters are so basic and generic it is unreal. When you have a talented cast, it feels worse that their talent has been wasted and that these roles might as well have gone to up and coming actors who could have got themselves recognised a bit.Story The story is here is as bland and generic as possible. It has some similar vibes to a film like John Wick but that has way more depth and unique world building to it that this film didn't. I didn't care about any of the characters and any twist and turn is incredibly predictable from minute one to the final minute and it just did nothing for me.Script The script also did nothing. It takes itself incredibly seriously and misses the mark. The drama is dull and not conveyed well enough and there is a lack of balance in terms of the tone and it just causes this film to be incredibly forgettable.Style The style is possibly the most important part of an action film and this film does it okay. There are some decent action sequences that are well performed and that is crucial to any sort of entertainment that is here. But there isn't any action scene that really wowed me, it just feels a bit safe and forgettable and that is how the majority of people will see this film.Overall Overall, Without Remorse is a poor action film. It is clear that this is meant to be a start of a Tom Clancy Film Franchise but this is a bad start and there are plenty of better action films out there to sink your teeth into."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0499097/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," A bit slow at certain point, but overall full of quite intense action scene! Really should watch it! ","This film start with a Navy SEAL "John" having mission at Syria, and he back to his house with his wife scene! As turnout, this film is about John need to take revenge on a corrupted secretary "Clay" for the murder of his wife! Entire film full of quite intense action scene! Such as, bloody shooting, bloody stabbing, martial art fighting, throwing grenade, explosion, car crash, things broken, and burning! Make the film quite watchable! At the end, after killing Clay, John been assigned with another identity! Still have a post credit scene! John suggesting the counterterrorist project "Rainbow" to Robert! That's It! A quite entertain film!"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0499097/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," I love Michael B. Jordan and Jamie Bell, but... ","This movie was very disappointing. If it wasn't for Jordan and Bell's acting I probably would've give this movie a 3.5 stars. Disappointing doesn't necessarily mean terrible, though. There were aspects I enjoyed, most notably the action scenes, which felt raw and real and were just fun to watch.Other than that, this movie lacked substance and depth. There was no respectable villain and the plot felt incredibly bland and simple."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0499097/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Just too dull ","I love a movie based on a Tom Clancy novel.The Hunt For Red October , Patriot Games , The Sum Of All Fears and Clear And Present Danger and four great action films that i can think of from the top of my head.Sadly Without Remorse isn't anywhere near good enough to mentioned in the same breath as those despite another good leading man.Seeking justice for the murder of his pregnant wife, an elite Navy SEAL uncovers a covert plot that threatens to engulf the United States and Russia in an all-out war.Without doubt , the best thing about this film is Michael B Jordan. He's a very watchable actor who is going from strength to strength.The film itself had plenty wrong with with it.The story doesn't have the appeal of a typical Clancy film.In fact it's pretty dull and the same goes for the action.It feels like a game of Call Of Duty and after i while i was zoning out.There is also one very poor bit of casting .Jodie Turner-Smith who plays Karen Greer is not convincing at all.Her acting is wooden , she definitely doesn't look like someone from the special forces and they couldn't even get a military uniform that looked right on her.If you stay till the end of the credits there is another scene in which they indicate that there is going to be another film and it's hinted that it will be Rainbow Six.I'm not sure there will be much call for it after this offering."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0499097/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," Extremely average thriller ","Without Remorse is an extremely average thriller that's generic and predictable with an extremely forced sequel bait ending. The action scenes are competent but few and far between and it's surprisingly dull overall. The dialogue is laughably bad in places. However, Michael B. Jordan gives a great lead performance and Jodie Turner-Smith and Jamie Bell are both really good. The music by Jnsi is good."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0870154/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," a fine ride ","For 400 years, men have been searching the Amazon to find the Tears of the Moon, the flower petals of a legendary tree which can cures any illness or curse. It's 1916 London. Siblings Lily (Emily Blunt) and MacGregor Houghton (Jack Whitehall) steal an arrowhead artifact from the Royal Society. It's the key to finding the tree. They are pursued by the ruthless Prince Joachim (Jesse Plemons). They hire a boat skippered by Frank Wolff (Dwayne Johnson). Joachim reawakens cursed Spanish conquistadors led by Aguirre (Edgar Ramrez).As an action adventure, this is fairly good. It's trying to be The African Queen with a healthy dose of Pirates of the Caribbean. It's not as good as either. The chemistry between Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt is pretty good but it's strictly platonic. They have no romantic heat. It's the fun banter of kidding best friends. Anyone watching them interact in real life would notice their natural chemistry. It's a basic chemistry test mistake. Quite honestly, I would be more than happy to have these two turn into adventure best buddies. Maybe they could find the romantic chemistry eventually in the later movies but they don't have it in this one. I like Paul Giamatti and am disappointed that he doesn't follow them up the river. Jesse Plemons is going full cartoon in his villain acting but maybe somebody else could do it better. Still, it's a fun ride while it lasted."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0870154/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Jungle Cruise ","Jungle Cruise is an adaptation of a Disney Park ride that I can barely remember going to and I have been to both Disney parks in the USA.It also has five writers with various screenplay credits.Dwayne Johnson plays Frank. A down on his luck river boat captain who takes tourists for a ride in the Amazon.He is hired by adventurer Lily (Emily Blunt) and her uptight brother MacGregor Houghton (Jack Whitehall) who are on the search for the Tears of the Moon. The petals of a tree of life that can cure any illness. The Spanish were in search for it about 400 years earlier.Set in 1916, Lily finds that German Prince Joachim (Jesse Plemons) is also in pursuit at a time when the nations are at war. However Lily finds that Frank is a man who is hard to trust and he is full of cheesy jokes.This comedy adventure is a mish mash of previous movies. I found it more Romancing the Stone mixed with the Brendan Fraser The Mummy movies. There is also a hint of the Pirate of the Caribbean franchise.It harks back to two decades earlier when Disney were adapting their theme park rides rather than superhero movies or remaking their old cartoons as live action films.Jungle Cruise is a colourful romp that lacks originality."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0870154/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," I can't turn it off ","Text: Dr. Lily Houghton (Emily Blunt) steals an arrowhead from the British archives and absconds to the Amazon with her English snob brother (Jack Whitehall). They are in search of the legendary "Tears of the Moon" which she believes will cure disease. They need to charter a boat and they end up with Frank Wolff (Dwayne Johnson) a showman, conman, and punster.Based on a Disney Ride the film is a blend of "The African Queen" and "Medicine Man" in the shadow of Colonel Fawcett. There are plenty of snakes in the film that begs the question, "Why can't Paul Giamatti do a convincing Italian accent?"Guide: Disney film. Pushing the boundary saying the S word plainly in German."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0870154/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," old-style ride updated for the 21st century ","I had never heard of the Jungle Cruise ride until I heard of this movie, and that Disneyland was removing racist caricatures from the ride (well, they kinda have to at this point).As for the movie "Jungle Cruise", it was what I expected. Lots of action reminiscent of every adventure movie of the past forty years, and no shortage of CGI. Very much a summer movie. Sure to entertain the tykes."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0870154/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Jungle Cruise ","Just like Pirates of the Caribbean, this started life as a Disney World attraction before becoming a feature film, it was delayed from release for a whole year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but when it did come out, I was hoping it would be a good ride, directed by Jaume Collet-Serra (House of Wax, Orphan, The Shallows). Basically, in 1556, in South America there is a search by Spanish conquistadors (knights) to find the Tears of the Moon, a mythical tree whose flowers cure illness, heal injuries, and lift curses. Don Aguirre (Edgar Ramrez) stabs the tribal chief for refusing to reveal the tree's location and destroys the village. The dying chief (Pedro Lopez) curses the conquistadors, making them immortal and unable to leave the Amazon River for all eternity. In 1916 London, Dr. Lily Houghton (Emily Blunt) has been researching the Tears of the Moon, and her brother MacGregor (Jack Whitehall) presents it to the Royal Society, claiming that the tree's flowers could revolutionise medicine and help the British war effort. The Houghtons request access to a recently acquired arrowhead artifact. Lily believes it and an old map are key to finding the tree. But the society deny the request, believing the tree to be a myth and female scientists to be inferior. Lily steals the arrowhead, narrowly evading German royal Prince Joachim (Jesse Plemons) seeking the tree to help the Germans win the war. In Brazil, Lily and MacGregor need a boat and a guide to lead them down the Amazon. Frank Wolff (Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson) is a riverboat skipper who offers cut-rate jungle cruises embellished with faked dangers and corny puns. Lily goes to find businessman and harbourmaster Nilo Nemolato (Paul Giamatti). Frank has snuck into his office to steal the keys to his boat back. Frank poses as Nilo and learns of her quest to find the tree, but declines her offer, believing it too dangerous, but reconsiders upon seeing the arrowhead. The real Nilo reveals himself, and Lily is unhappy with Frank's trickery, but accepts his offer after he saves them from a jaguar attack, although the jaguar is revealed to be his pet, Proxima. Frank steals back his repossessed boat engine, and he and the Houghtons depart. Joachim attacks the group in a German submarine, but they manage to escape and journey downriver. Inside Frank's cabin, Lily notices photos and sketches of modern inventions, as well as maps, drawings, and research on the Tears of the Moon. She realises Frank has been seeking the tree, but he insists he gave up a long time ago. A "cannibal" tribe captures the group, but this is another one of Frank's schemes, which he claims he was unable to call off in time. Lily is furious and doubts he is trustworthy. The tribal leader Trader Sam (Veronica Falcn) translates the symbols on the arrowhead, revealing the tree's location and that it only blooms under a blood moon. Meanwhile, Joachim locates the conquistadors turned to stone inside a cave and frees them using water from the river. They consist of Sancho (Dani Rovira), covered in honey and bees, Melchor (Quim Gutirrez), covered in tree roots and branches, and Gonzalo (Dan Dargan Carter), made of mud. Joachim offers to lift their curse if they retrieve the arrowhead. The Spaniards attack the tribe and fatally stab Frank while Lily flees with the arrowhead. As she crosses the curse's boundary, the pursuing Spaniards are dragged back into the jungle by vines. To the Houghtons' shock, Frank has survived; his real name is Francisco, he is one of the conquistadors on a noble quest to save Aguirre's gravely ill daughter. When the Spaniards attacked the natives, Frank defended the village. Frank trapped the conquistadors in the cave where they turned to stone, and he spent centuries searching for the tree to lift his own curse. While Joachim has captured MacGregor, Lily and Frank go on alone. Following the arrowhead instructions, they find a waterfall, and activate a submerged stone structure to lower the water level and reveal a passageway. Joachim and the Germans catch up to them and follow Lily and Frank, along with MacGregor and the Spaniards to find the tree. They learn the arrowhead is a heart-shaped locket containing a gemstone. Placing the gem into the trunk of the dormant tree causes it to bloom under the blood moon. The light of the moon begins to pass, but Lily manages to grab a single flower from the tree before the bloom ends. A fight ensues, with MacGregor killing Joachim, while Frank crashes his boat to block the river, turning himself and the Spaniards into stone. Lily, realising she has feelings for Frank, sacrifices the flower to release him from the stone, lifting his curse and restoring his mortality. Frank, who intended to end his life, decides to continue living to be with Lily. The moon casts one last beam of light, blooming a single flower and allowing Lily's research to proceed. Returning to England, the Royal Society offers Lily full membership, but she rejects, showing Frank around London and teaching him to drive an automobile. Also starring Andy Nyman as Sir James Hobbs-Coddington, and Raphael Alejandro as Zaqueu. Johnson is a likeable rugged hero, Blunt is good as the prim-and-proper scientist, comedian Whitehall is good comic relief, and Plemons with his dodgy German accent is an amusing pantomime villain. As you would expect this is a mission movie full of obstacles and dangers, from raging rivers to fierce creatures, the special effects are terrific, and the comedy is added at the right moments, it is a fun fantasy adventure. Very good!"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0870154/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","2"," Jungle Crud ","I love jungle adventure films, and I like Dwayne Johnson, but Disney's Jungle Cruise is a perilous journey into mega-budget awfulness, director Jaume Collet-Serra unsuccessfully steering this wreck of a movie into turbulent waters with a messy script that lurches awkwardly from one CGI-drenched scene to another.'The Rock' plays riverboat captain Frank Wolff, who is hired by well-meaning scientist Lily Houghton (Emily Blunt) to take her and her brother MacGregor (Jack Whitehall) on an expedition into the most uncharted regions of the Amazon in search for the tree of life, the petals of which can cure all known ailments. This being a Raiders of the Lost Ark style adventure, the tree is also of interest to a group of nasty Germans, led by Prince Joachim (Jesse Plemons), who has less altruistic reasons for finding the life-giving plant.Lovable rogue Frank steers his CGI boat down the CGI river, while Lily marvels at the CGI animals that inhabit the region, all the while pursued by Joachim in his CGI submarine. After successfully navigating CGI raging rapids and a CGI waterfall, the adventurers discover an ancient underwater mechanism that drains an entire river bed (frightfully clever chaps, these Amazonian engineers), revealing the CGI tree to our intrepid explorers. Unfortunately, Joachim has several supernatural CGI conquistadors on his side, who cause problems for our heroes and heroine.The terrible too-many-cooks screenplay, by no less than seven writers, makes very little sense at times: no explanation is given for how Joachim knows how to locate and reanimate the ancient Spanish conquistadors, each of whom has their own inexplicable superpower. Even more perplexing is the revivification of the tree by Lily, who mumbles some unintelligible nonsense, before snapping open her precious stone arrowhead to reveal a sachet of Miracle-Gro (or something like that-I really wasn't sure).With its muddled plot and overuse of digital trickery, Jungle Cruise is a frustratingly lacklustre ride, but perhaps the film's biggest failure is to never genuinely excite the audience: with his Indiana Jones movies, Spielberg frequently put the hero in palpably perilous situations that kept the viewer on the edge of their seat; it's hard to feel thrilled and exhilarated when Jungle Cruise's characters are engaging in witty banter while supposedly facing mortal danger.2.5/10, rounded down to 2 for the CGI dolphins, the CGI frogs, the CGI snakes, the CGI tarantula, the CGI toucans, and for Proxima, Frank's pet CGI jaguar."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0870154/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Good old fashioned adventure for the entire family... ","Well, the 2021 adventure movie "Jungle Cruise" is a definite must watch movie if you enjoy movies that have Dwayne Johnson in it.I sat down to watch this 2021 Disney movie with a certain amount of expectations to it, since it was both a Disney movie, but also had Dwayne Johnson on the cast list. I think he is very well-cut, pardon the pun, for the adventure movie genre.And he doesn't disappoint in "Jungle Cruise", let me just say that right away. Yup, he is so well-cast for this movie and really carries it phenomenally with his performance and that particular character.The storyline told in "Jungle Cruise", as written by Michael Green, Glenn Ficarra, John Requa, John Norville, Josh Goldstein and Glenn Ficarra definitely was a very entertaining one. And it was the type of storyline that quickly picks you up from the very beginning and takes you along with it for quite the thrill ride throughout the jungle. I was expecting it to be good, but I must admit that the story actually turned out to be way more interesting and detailed than I had anticipated.Visually then "Jungle Cruise" is just spectacular. The jungle really offers a lot to look at, and just makes for a grand setting for the movie. But also things like the wardrobe, props, etc. Were really spot on and very detailed, adding a lot to the movie.The CGI in the movie was good, but of course with this being Disney, why wouldn't it be? And the jaguar pet really was a nice touch to the movie."Jungle Cruise" definitely has a good cast. Of course Dwayne Johnson is the main attraction and he carries the movie so wonderfully. I wasn't initially thrilled about it being Emily Blunt to co-star alongside Dwayne Johnson, but she really put on a great performance and I liked her in this movie. It was really nice to see Paul Giamatti in the movie, and he had a wonderful character here, just a shame that he wasn't given more on-screen time.If you get the chance to watch director Jaume Collet-Serra's "Jungle Cruise", you must do so. Especially if you enjoy family movies and adventure movies. So if you enjoyed movies like "The Goonies", "Indiana Jones", "Journey 2: The Mysterious Island", etc. Then you most certainly will also enjoy "Jungle Cruise".This is a movie that I can warmly recommend you sit down to watch.I am rating "Jungle Cruise" a well-deserved seven out of ten stars."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0870154/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Jungle Cruise was pretty enjoyable for what it was ","Partly inspired by Raiders of the Lost Ark and The African Queen as well as the Disney Parks' famous ride this movie is named after, Jungle Cruise is way too much exposition though things are kept hopping during most of its running time. Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt (along with the person playing the latter's brother) take us on a mostly enjoyable ride to whatever they're looking for. My movie theatre-working friend enjoyed this much more than I did but I liked it fine for what it was. Some of the most enjoyable parts were Johnson's corny puns. So that's a partial recommendation of Jungle Cruise."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0870154/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","3"," Jungle Cruise ","Take a likeable pairing of Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt, throw in a plot that seems to be part Jumanji and part Pirates of the Caribbean and put it together under the heading of Jungle Cruise.That seems to be the thinking behind this film based on another Disneyland ride (I can't wait for the 'It's a Small World' film...).It's fine, it's enjoyable enough, but goes on far too long, and the endless verbal sparring between the leads (not to mention the obsession with Emily Blunt's character being in trousers) grows a bit tiresome over time.Fine enough, but I wouldn't rush to see it again."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0870154/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Solid, if unremarkable, Disney fayre... ","A bit like Chris Pratt, I like Dwayne Johnson. He's an out and out entertainer - there is nothing complicated about his presentation, and here is no different. This is just a family adventure film that sees him taking his clients "Lily" (Emily Blunt) and her posh brother "MacGregor" (Jack Whitehall) on a search to find a tree with leaves that might have amazing recuperative powers that could eradicate illness. Along the way, they have to battle a jungle brimming with hungry beasties and with some recently revived ancient conquistadors who have an agenda all of their own. The visual effects are as you'd expect from Disney and as far as it goes this is a perfectly acceptable, lightweight piece of cinema. It's derivative, certainly - it has shades of "The Mummy" (1999) to the storyline alongside a bit of "Dead Man's Chest" (2006) with Whitehall reminding me a lot of the John Hannah character from the former, but it still moves along apace and though hardly taxing for the adults, it ought to keep the young ones entertained for what did seem a slightly over long 2hrs-odd."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0870154/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Charming ","A darling cast and a unique storyline make Jungle Cruise a charming movie. There are a few flaws and it's definitely a bit long. But, it's visually spectacular, had a good mix of humor and action, and leading lady Emily Blunt has never been better. A wonderful movie experience."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0870154/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Decent family action adventure ","As World War II gets under way, siblings Lily and MacGregor Houghton steal an Amazonian arrowhead which is apparently the key to finding a fabled blossom with is a miracle cure-all. This brings them to the ramshackle river steamer belonging to rogueish skipper and serial liar Frank, and the adventure is under way.Disney turns another theme park ride into a movie, aided by heavy influences from the ride itself, the Pirates franchise, Indiana Jones, and The African Queen. This leads to the most obvious criticism of the movie: it is very obviously assembled from bits and pieces from elsewhere, and doesn't easily forge its own identity.Dwayne Johnson's Frank is the likeable hunk character which he can do in his sleep, and Emily Blunt is generic feisty, somewhat ahead of her time proto-feminist with annoying contradictory traits of imaginative resourcefulness and determination coupled with naivete. Only Jack Whitehall goes beyond cardboard cutout. His effete MacGregor is by far the funniest character in the film and actually has a credible character development arc.The action, effects and spectacle are fine. Many of the shots seem desighed for 3D presentation. There is a plot twist halfway through, a good one which I didn't see coming.This is an enjoyable, undemanding popcorn movie."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0870154/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Slowly runs out of steam......... ","When this was first announced, I had little or no expectations for the film. After all, the success rate of Disney rides turned into movies was very average.But after reading some of the reviews stating that it was an adventure movie that could hold up next to Indiana Jones and Jurassic Park. My expectations then went nuclear, and it also had the element of 3D, which I have a weakness for.Johnson and Blunt are wonderful onscreen, bouncing off each other and having wonderful chemistry, which takes away the fundamental problems of the film.The first act is amazing, introducing our main characters with wit and lively action to complement each of them. If it stayed like this for the majority of the film, it could have easily been one of the funniest adventure films I've seen in a long time.However, as soon as the titular adventure is underway, we have more time with Jack Whitehall, who, in all fairness, is a fine actor, but his motivation here must have been him emulating John Hannah in the 'Mummy' movies, and the film also slips from Indiana Jones, to the Mummy franchise. It becomes more fantastical in its narrative, rather than staying with the grounded adventure it promised in the first act.Then, it falls into the POTC, with some twists that you can see coming from a mile off, and if you remember the twist in 'The Curse Of The Black Pearl', they just use that here.Throw in a stereotypical villain and henchman, then you get this film, which is playing it safe all the way through.So, although it's not by any means terrible, but it could have been so much more."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0870154/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Nice easy to watch adventure movie. ","If you like adventure movies like Indiana Jones, Romancing The Stone, Jewel Of The Nile, Jumanji and others in this genre you can't go wrong with Jungle Cruise. It's the same entertainment, a bit over the top, not always making sense, but that's hardly the point with these kind of movies. It's just a bit of fun. To me it's very relaxing to watch these kind of popcorn movies. The Rock or Dwayne Johnson might not be the greatest actor but I think he fits in this genre. He's okay to watch in non serious movies. Emily Blunt did a good job as well as did the rest of the cast. The CGI's were more than decent, they clearly had a big budget for these parts in the movie. Jungle Cruise is perfect to watch as a family movie or if you're just a big fan of easy adventure."

I'm used to it in fight scenes in bad action movies. It recently sunk snake eyes for me. But this movie barely has fight scenes. It isn't martial arts. So why is it still being used? So many scenes were difficult to follow, especially the ones involving cgi.That's my main complaint. There were some stupid moments, and i started getting bored by the end. But i had a decent time and laughed a good amount. It's fairly entertaining with a serviceable story. But with the terribly filmed action and being bored during the climax, i can't give this a positive score (1 viewing, 8/4/2021)"

I know it got hit hard with some critics but I found their chemistry to be electric and the whole aesthetic and feel to this film was unlike anything else theatres had to offer this year.

This action adventure appears to be a direct descendent of Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), The Mummy (1999); Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003), and National Treasure (2004). Somehow this movie version almost becomes a parody but does not and mostly succeeds in breaking a little new ground in its action sequences and storyline offering its audience more refreshing than expected experience. The animated big cat and several other special effects still have not quite established the maturity of the authenticity needed to completely win over skeptical audience members. And several places in the movie where there are an obvious attempts at live comedic staged reaction that almost fails and loses their timing and punch as well as offering up a few unbelievable staging and remarkable recovery scenes that defy reason to the point of almost breaking the movie fantasy this action adventure that has been casting its spell over the audience. Overall, Jungle Cruise is consistently enjoyable and a moderate breath of fresh air that makes a trip to the theater worthwhile."

Give it a go even if you are not familiar with the Disney link."

"," very Disney-sque ","What I cannot figure out about this genre of Disney movie is that if people want to see one of these theme park attractions, why don't they go to Anaheim or Lake Buena Vista? Johnny Depp may be an answer, I guess.The movie is, for want of a better description, very Disney-sque. There is no point for me to get into the plot, other than offering a simple advice: don't challenge it. The thrills (Disney-sque, remember) and the somewhat underused cast are probably worth your 2 hours 7 minutes, although 1 hour 40 minutes would be better.Emily Blunt, as an expert English botanist in the beginning of the 20th century does a lot more talking than when we last saw her in "A quiet place II". Dwayne Johnson as an eccentric con man cum jungle cruise operator in the Amazon is in familiar territory. Edgar Ramirez, last seen as a taciturn and persevering detective in the mini-series "The undoing" is a trapped, tortured soul existing in perpetual twilight zone. Astonishingly versatile and prolific Paul Giamatti, whose most recent appearance for me is in the series "Billions", is all but wasted here as a caricature of an Italian money man. Similarly caricature, but a little more used, is Jesse Plemons playing the villain, a German prince. I cannot quite decide which of his two excellent portraits I like better, "The butcher" in the TV series "Fargo", or the creepy neighbour policeman in "Game night"."

",""Jungle Cruise" is an Adventure - Comedy movie in which we follow a small group of people on their riverboat cruise and their search of Lgrimas de Cristal Tree. They have to search for it and even face Don Aguirre who led the Spanish conquistadors to South America in 1556 for it.I liked this movie very much because the plot was very interesting and the interpretations of the cast were simply amazing. The movie became even better with some plot twists that I did not expect and some very clever details that were presented. The interpretations of both Emily Blunt who played as Lily Houghton and Dwayne Johnson who played as Frank Wolff were very good and their combination worked very well. The direction which was made by Jaume Collet-Serra it was also very good and he succeeded on creating a bond between his main characters and the audience. Finally, I have to say that "Jungle Cruise" is an interesting movie and I strongly recommend it to everyone because I am sure it will travel you and you will have a great time watching it."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0993840/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Seen this one before... ","The latest Hollywood zombie blockbuster comes in the shape of ARMY OF THE DEAD (2021), made by Netflix and directed by Zach Snyder, no stranger to the genre after his 2004 DAWN OF THE DEAD remake. This one's an 'anything goes' comic book-style action adventure in which a crack team are sent into Las Vegas to retrieve a fortune from an underground vault. Two things complicate the situation: 1) the entire city is shortly to be nuked, and 2) the city is overrun with fast-moving zombies. I had no idea what to expect from this one and the end result is enjoyable to a degree, albeit with plenty of caveats.The main problem with the film is that it's surprisingly cliched. ALIENS seems to be a particular inspiration here, with one character a direct copy of Vasquez and the entire climax essentially copying the James Cameron classic. The second problem is that at two and a half hours in length it goes on far too long, with characters regularly pausing for heart-to-heart conversations - ridiculous when they're surrounded by zombies and, later on, a bomb is due to detonate in twenty minutes! A Hollywood trope I always hate to see. Half an hour excised from this would have made it pacier and more exciting. On the plus side, once it gets going it holds together quite nicely, with tons of gory mayhem and a kind of zombie hierarchy that feels based on the White Walkers in GAME OF THRONES; plenty of solid actors in the cast doing their thing well too. It's hardly an unmissable film, but in the tradition of 'switch your brain off' Hollywood entertainment it's not too bad."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0993840/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," too long ","Vegas, Baby! A military convoy leaves Area 51 with a mystery cargo. They crash into a newlywed couple outside of Vegas. The cargo escapes and a zombie apocalypse is unleashed upon Las Vegas. Scott Ward (Dave Bautista) becomes a hero escaping the chaos. The city is walled off with shipping containers. The government decides to nuke the city and vaporize all the zombies. Scott is recruited to retrieve $200 million from a casino vault before the nuclear blast destroys the cash.At its core, this is a very simple heist movie and really only needs no more than ninety minutes. Zack Snyder decides to do an extra hour on top of that to its detriment. He insists on injecting his political views which is perfectly fine for this franchise which is known to do some political skewering. Go ahead. Go full Joe Rogan. This franchise is built for it. What I hate in this movie is his world construction. Time and time again, I roll my eyes at what this world is doing to deal with a zombie outbreak. There is no way that they would quarantine these people right next to the city. I'm guessing that Snyder is pushing hard for a border comparison to the real world. I'm not feeling it. The shipping container wall is a silly kid's story treatment. It's a 10 year old boy coming up with a comic book idea. It's not thought out. I don't even want to compare it to the real border wall because that wall makes more sense. How do they corral the zombies while the wall is being built? In the real world, there would be a second wall and no go zone around the wall. This world is not well constructed and that bothered me a lot. This is a very expensive B-movie and no money was spent in the writing. Zack Snyder probably wrote most of it and it shows. I do like the simple heist idea at its center. I would give this a passing grade but it's still too damn long."

Ward's estranged daughter Kate joins them as she works in a quarantine camp and is looking for someone lost inside Vegas.However Tanaka has an ulterior motive as his shifty associate also joins the team.This is a dumb action movie with fast moving zombies and even robot zombies. Some zombies are a bit more intelligent than others.There is plenty of blood splattered zombie shootouts, some of the action resembles that of game consoles.There are also plenty of flaws in the film that makes little sense. Too much chatter between characters when there is absolute urgency.

Like with his other output, it is the visual treats that will keep you engaged here, not some character choices that will make you want to personally strangle said character(s)! Or dialog that seems to completely ignore what was said minutes ago ... I guess that is also consistency to just ignore stuff that already happened.In this case I can forgive - and while I was on the verge of going for a 7 rather than an 8, I decided that the fun factor here is high enough to go for the bigger rating. If anything it is not Snyder who changes or the type of movie(s) he's making ... it is how we view it in a sense.So while I personally felt that the flaws in other outputs of his were too big to overlook, I cut him some slack here to say the least. A very bloody affair and as already said quite the visual treat you're getting. There is also some nudity here, though if that is what upsets you ... I seriously am not sure what to tell you - I guess we are all different in things that upsets us ... but yes, just so you know, it's not much, but it is there.The ending wins some brownie points in some sense after characters again are way too slow (even without slow motion) in their decision making, but almost loses them entirely by ...

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0993840/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," "One more step and I'll blow her head off. Well, more off!" ","I've been known to seek out both zombie films and caper flicks, so "Army of the Dead" provides a bonus since it incorporates both themes in one movie. But to say this picture had it's fair share of problems would be an understatement, with it's two and a half hour length being one of it's primary issues. That would have been alright if there was something more to the story and the characters, but this is one film where you don't really get to care about any of the players. Only one of them makes it to the end of the picture, and by that time you're left wondering what the point was, since neither of the two goals set out as a premise for the plot were ever achieved. Even the high profile David Bautista fails to inspire much as the leader of the ragtag bunch that heads into a Las Vegas quarantine zone occupied by hordes of zombies. Why he had so much angst over what kind of food truck he would run after hitting on a fifteen million dollar payday for himself alone was a puzzling question mark for this viewer, even if he did ultimately settle on lobster rolls.Say, for those wondering what happened to Geeta (Huma Qureshi), consider this. When she climbed into the helicopter, she moved to the front and to the right of pilot Peters (Tig Notaro). When the monster zombie jumped on board and began fighting with Scott Ward (Bautista), they went back and forth with Ward angling to get a shot off at his attacker. The second time he fired, he missed the zombie, and his bullet accidentally hit Geeta in the head. It's not shown on screen, but how else do you explain the blood spatter on the windshield and Peters' sickening reaction. That was my immediate thought when I first saw it, and I think that explanation holds up, at least better than having Geeta simply disappear from the story.But that's just one anomaly. I got the biggest kick out of everyone trying to shoot the monster zombie when he had that goofy helmet on his head. How about trying for a body shot? And as far as any urgency to get the heck out of the nuclear blast zone, well, there's no way to explain that one. In fact there wasn't really a whole lot that made sense throughout the movie, but if you like tons of zombies getting mowed down by rapid machine gun fire, there's enough of that to stoke your adrenaline. Otherwise, this is one time when Elvis would have been glad to leave the building."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0993840/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","3"," Bloated like a week old corpse, and stinks almost as much. ","Of the five previous Zack Snyder films that I have seen, I have only enjoyed two, but one of those was his excellent 2004 remake of Dawn of the Dead, so I assumed that the man knows what he is doing when it comes to zombies. Army of the Dead has taught me to assume nothing. This is one of the dumbest zombie films I have seen (and I've seen quite a few). It's full of stupid characters making bad decisions, horrible plot developments, and ridiculous action, and worse still, every scene is either shot with an extremely short depth of field, or some kind of blur effect, which proves irritating in the extreme. Come to think of it, some of the CGI is pretty damn ropey as well (zombie tiger!).Dave Bautista is the star of this bloated two-and-a-half-hour undead crapfest, playing hard-nut Scott Ward, who gives up flipping burgers to assemble a team of tough mercenaries with the aim of liberating the zombie-infested city of Las Vegas of the cash still laying in its vaults. With a nuclear strike scheduled to hit the city in little over a day, the last thing they need are problems, such as Ward's daughter Kate (Ella Purnell) joining the mission to try and save a friend, or the traitor in their midst who is willing to sacrifice the others to line his own pockets.A heist movie crossed with the zombie genre should make for a great piece of escapism (I've long had an idea for a similarly themed film myself), but Snyder's screenplay is terrible, packed with unnecessary emotional drama (Ward's estranged relationship with his daughter is such a clich), moronic developments and plot threads that go nowhere (Kate's rescue mission). All of the mercenaries enter the zombie zone with bare arms, which is asking for trouble; the vault in which the money is kept is protected by booby traps that come straight out of a Looney Tunes cartoon; and why dream of running a sandwich truck if you're going to have $15m in the bank?Worst of all, Snyder's zombies are a special breed, guaranteed to irk most zombie purists: there are slow zombies called shamblers, which is fine, but Snyder also has Vegas inhabited by more intelligent zombies with amazing physical prowess, running at speed, dodging bullets like Neo from The Matrix, and performing incredible leaps, landing in a three-point superhero pose like Thor. Not only are they fast, but they are incredibly strong and seem to communicate in guttural growls and screeches. The leader is able to ride a horse (a zombie horse!), and has even somehow fashioned himself a bulletproof metal helmet. I struggled with Big Daddy from Land of the Dead, so all of this was a few steps too far.2.5/10, generously rounded up to three for the gore, of which there is plenty (the splattery opening credits is the best part of the whole film - it's downhill after that).N. B. Am I imagining it, or did Snyder 'take inspiration' from John Landis: in the opening scene of Army of the Dead, a soldier trips and falls; as his pal goes to lend a hand, he is attacked by a leaping zombie. It's almost identical in execution to the attack on the moors in An American Werewolf in London (my suspicions are compounded by the use of Bad Moon Rising on the soundtrack)."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0993840/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," Hyped up to be way more than it delivered... ","Of course I had to sit down and watch the 2021 zombie movie "Army of the Dead", as I do enjoy everything zombie. But I must admit that after having seen the trailer, then I was somewhat put off on the movie. But given the hype of the movie and Zack Snyder, and it being a zombie movie, of course I found myself sitting down to watch it.And as I had feared and anticipated, then "Army of the Dead" didn't turn out to be a great movie in the zombie collection. There were just so many things wrong with this movie.First of all, the movie is a total no-brainer plot. You just simply switch off your brain, bring out the popcorn and just lean back and enjoy the action. That is all that was to it, pure and simple. This was a brainless action movie, nothing more, nothing less.I have to say that it didn't feel like a zombie movie at all. Especially because Zack Snyder took every single piece of zombie lore and protocol and just totally ignored it. Sure, that could be a good thing, but it just didn't pan out in "Army of the Dead" and it sure didn't provide the zombie genre with a breath of fresh air - pardon the pun.The zombies in the movie, well, where to start? First of all, they were fast and agile, nimble and extremely well-organized. No. That just didn't work. And it didn't really work either with the sounds that they made. No human vocal cords could ever produce such sounds, alive or undead. It just made no sense, and it added a level of stupidity to the movie that I couldn't look past. Then there were the thing about the zombie make-up. Again, no, this didn't feel like a zombie movie. It was more like I was watching a marauding army of orcs from the "Lord of the Rings" movies. It just had nothing, absolutely nothing, to do with zombies.There were only a couple of proper zombie moments in the movie, and that was oddly enough when you saw the zombie tiger and the zombie horse. Everything else was just not working out. Fast and agile zombies that make weird sci-fi noises just doesn't cut it.Then there was the scene where the zombie leader pulled out the unborn zombie child and held it up to the sky while surrounded by a host of his undead minions. Seriously? Zack Snyder went "The Lion King" here. It was just so stupid and I was laughing so hard at that scene.Not to mention zombies hibernating. Or zombies retaining intelligence and being able to form a pseudo-kingdom.As for the cast, well they definitely had some rather good actors and actresses on the cast list, with the likes of Omari Hardwick, Matthias Schweighfer, Hiroyuki Sanada, Tig Notaro and none other than Garret Dillahunt. But they had Dave Bautista in the leading role. Seriously? Dave Bautista?The story was as predictable as it was laughable and silly. And the ending of the movie was just a slap the face with a cold, dead fish to the audience that had suffered through 2 hours of brainless action movie pretending to be a zombie movie.Sure, now I've seen "Army of the Dead" and I can tick it off of my 'to-watch-list', but I can honestly say that I am never returning to watch "Army of the Dead" a second time.My rating of "Army of the Dead" lands on a more than generous four out of ten stars."

","It is exactly what I expected from this film which I wait for since one year and a half now. Fun, dark, violent, moving, it purchases many elements to please the most of the audiences, but in the good sense. But the directing is rather ankward from time to time, maybe because of the over length for this kind of film. And the frame 1.78 is totally wrong, it should have been 2.35. And why did Zack Snyder film an opening sequence, during the credits, NOT BEFORE THE CREDITS, where we can see scenes invisible during the film, scenes where we can see many main characters die? Why? I thought it was a spoiler from the beginning and wanted to stop watching. But I proceeded till the end, and these sequences of the opening credits have NOTHING to do with the rest of the movie. So, if you read those lines before the viewing, don't worry, OK? Not the best Snyder ever but not the worst for sure. You also may prefer DAWN OF THE DEAD, his and Romero's one too. Of course.... And it is never explained, unless I missed something, why Dave Bautista's character killed his wife, whom his daughter talks about? Was he a soldier before, an ex con?"

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0993840/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Viva Zombies! ","Writer & director Zack Snyder is no stranger to zombie sagas. He made his cinematic directorial debut in 2004 with his inspired remake of George A. Romero's 1978 classic "Dawn of the Dead," starring Ving Rhames, Sarah Polley, and Jake Weber. Afterward, he staged his suspenseful Spartan saga "300" (2006) with Gerard Butler, and then his magnum opus "Watchmen" (2009), with Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Malin Akerman, and Patrick Wilson. Snyder followed up this seminal classic with his bizarre, animated adventure "Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole" (2010), not exactly kid stuff, before he ventured farther out on a limb with a sinister shoot'em up "Sucker Punch" (2011), featuring Emily Browning, Abbie Cornish, Jena Malone, and Vanessa Hudgens. Of course, Snyder reinvented the immortal DC Comics' characters Superman and Batman in "Man of Steel" (2013), toplining Henry Cavill as the eponymous hero, and then in his notorious "Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice" (2016), launching Ben Affleck as the Caped Crusader, with Henry Cavill reprising his Superman role. After private tragedies forced him to withdraw from "Justice League" (2017), Marvel guru Joss Whedon finished it. Later this summer after its debut on HBO/MAX, "Zack Snyder's extended cut of Justice League" (2021) will appear on home video. Seventy-one percent of Rotten Tomatoes critics have given it positive reviews, while ninety-four percent of audiences have loved it.Coming full circle, Snyder has returned to his roots with Netflix's "Army of the Dead," starring David Bautista. Formulaic from start to finish, this two-hour & twenty-minute zombie melodrama/ heist film is sure to assuage the cravings of bloodthirsty zombie fans. Basically, "Army of the Dead" is zombie porn about the undead munch-athon. Not surprisingly, bare-breasted zombie strippers feast on an ill-fated tourist, but thereafter Snyder doesn't keeps everybody covered up. Tough guy David Bautista assembles a team of reckless souls and plunges them into the no-man's land of Las Vegas after it has become a hot zone to retrieve $200 million from a casino bank vault. "Army of the Dead" gets off to a sturdy start as Snyder and scribes Shay Hatten and Jay Harold explain why ghouls galore overrun Sin City. Like toxic disposal movies where a barrel of chemical waste tumbles off a truck, sinks into a river, and spreads its contaminants both up and down stream, "Army" opens with a heavily armed military convoy escorting a 'top-secret' cargo. Ecstatic newlyweds having sex in their front seat crash into the flatbed military cargo truck. The impact knocks a huge locker onto the highway. Told too late to destroy it, the soldiers watch a muscular zombie smash his way out of said locker. Although they empty their automatic weapons into this resilient zombie, the fiend survives and rips them apart. Conveniently, the town nearest the outbreak is Las Vegas!Not only does the alpha zombie who broke out without a scratch forge his own army from scratch, but he also leads his undead minions into an unsuspecting Vegas for the ultimate flesh & blood buffet. The opening twenty minutes quickly establishes the premise of zombified Vegas. Miraculously, the military stacks up a towering barrier of shipping containers around Las Vegas to thwart a zombie exodus. Medical authorities pitch a camp for suspected infected and armed sentries eyeball them. Meantime, the owner of casino, Bly Tanaka (Hiroyuki Sanada of "Mr. Holmes"), refuses to let that big boodle of $200 million in loot languish. However, he doesn't have the luxury of forever, our President has ordered an imminent low-yield aerial nuke attack on Sin City. Mind you, Tanaka's insurance company has paid off his monetary losses already, since the loot is forever forfeit, because an army of zombies sits on it like a medieval dragoon. Nevertheless, greedy as only a genuine villain is, Tanaka doesn't want to lose that fortune. He approaches a short-order cook, Scott Ward (David Bautista of "Spectre"), awarded the Medal of Freedom during the zombie invasion when he rescued the Secretary of Defense, about bringing back those bucks. He offers Scott and company a $50 million payday to fetch him his oodles. Initially skeptical about such an outlandish proposal, Scott decides to take Tanaka's deal.Scott wrangles a maven motley crew. A mechanic named Maria Cruz (Ana De La Reguera of "Nacho Libre"); a chainsaw-toting troubleshooter Vanderohe (Omari Hardwick of "Kick Ass"); a hotshot chopper pilot Marianne Peters (Tig Notaro of "Instant Family"); a crack shot Mikey Guzman (Ral Castillo of "Unsane"), with his own YouTube channel for his zombie kills; and a goofball German safecracker Ludwig Dieter (Matthias Schweighfer of "Valkyrie"), who sings like a bimbo soprano with he is scared. They descend into Sin City with a blonde coyote, Chambers (stunt woman Samantha Win), to conduct them through a virulent gauntlet. Chambers warns them that not all of the zombies are so-called 'shamblers,' and some have a modicum of intelligence. Wait, smart zombies? Indeed, the leader of these mindless maniacs is Zeus (Richard Cetrone of "Underworld"), and he is a genuine oddball. Wearing a tattered cape and a bulletproof face mask which shields the upper part of his face, Zeus rides a horse like Alexander the Great and shares his dominion with a queen, a Medusa-look alike. Snyder and company treat Zeus and his dreadful queen as a rom-com couple. Actually, "Warm Bodies" (2013) beat Rich to the punch with its romantic couple subplot. Of course, nothing goes according to plan for either Scott or Tanaka after they roll into Vegas.Snyder dreamed up his outlandish but entertaining "Army of the Dead" premise while he was helming "Dawn of the Dead," and he has been biding his time since then to direct it. Mind you, this isn't the first zombie apocalypse to devastate Sin City. "Highlander" director Russell Mulcahy's "Resident Evil: Extinction"(2007) claims that distinction. Nevertheless, the zombie queen's severed head that lives is unforgettable! Altogether, the discouraging ending to "Army of the Dead" exacts a terrible toll on what should have amounted to mindless mayhem."

A group of dodgy individuals is commissioned to sneak in and rob a vault in a casino/hotel the day before the government nukes Vegas.This is not a bad idea. Sadly, this does nit make it a good film.So Zack Snyder co-writes and directs a zombie caper movie. It is very long and extraordinarily violent, and typical Snyder ie. Visually very impressive, but with an overriding air of being the sort of thing a rather unpleasant 14-year old might come up with.For every interesting idea - the relationship between the zombie "king" and "queen", for instance - there are two scenes where an obstacle is introduced for the sole purpose of headshotting videogame zombie fodder. Apart from the relationship between Dave Bautista's character and his daughter, none of the other characters come close to convincing.I say again - keep Snyder behind the camera, but don't let him near a keyboard because the immature adolescent in him comes roaring out."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0993840/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","2"," A failed comedy ","This film is directed and written by Zack Snyder?! It's garbage, from start to end. The only good bits in it are comedic and the rest is laughable, but not in a good way. It is a two hour and a half heist movie where everybody is an idiot. With zombies. They are idiots, too. The daughter, as usual, kills more people than the villains by being humane and in distress and, as unbelievable as it sounds, more of an idiot than everybody else.Then there is the acting. Dave Bautista moves like a grandpa. Theo Rossi, who did pretty well in Luke Cage, has a ridiculous role that makes no sense. Garret Dillahunt was good in the Terminator series, but he acts like a jester in this film. Tig Notaro is not really funny after being the highlight of Star Trek Discovery. Hiroyuki Sanada... oh, Hiroyuki Sanada... he was never a good actor, let's face it, but the depths to which he fails as an actor are truly amazing.And there is the story. A heist movie?! But with zombies that make no sense, with failed opportunities for sequels, with cardboard characters, with not one, but two straight white males that have to be brutally punished for their transgressions against women, with scenes like "I didn't do it for the money! I did it for youuuuu!". Jesus, it's worst than I am telling you it is, I just can't find the words to express the piece of excrement that this movie is.So if you are really really really drunk, this might be funny. I don't know. I've never been that drunk, but it could happen."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0993840/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","2"," A Lose-Lose Gamble ","You know how they say: there's nothing new in the zombie genre? Well, this movie 1000% proves that to be true.The tagline should've read: "If you liked I Am Legend, Aliens, Train to Busan Presents: Peninsula, Resident Evil, Resident Evil: Extinction, Warm Bodies, Escape from New York, Zombieland and Ocean's 11, then you've already seen Army of the Dead!" (And I know I must've missed another 6-7 films this straight-up ripped off.)As stated, this barely had a new idea, but probably worse, it had almost zero characters to root for. No one was that likable and everyone's fate is so horribly predicted from moment one. This felt much less like an homage, than just a very poor attempt at plagiarism.The one Brightside was the Nice Vegas backdrop and creativity with the Strip. I also knew they were filming inside The Cromwell during the pandemic (which probably wasn't safe at the time) so it was neat seeing how they transformed the place.Nope, can't recommend. The aforementioned movies are 10x better than this cheap cheat. Save yourself from the excruciatingly long and unnecessary 148 minutes."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0993840/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," Dumb fun without the fun ","Army of the dead begins as though it's going to be a fun B movie. 2 exchanges in different vehicles leads to disaster which leads to terror which leads to a fun title sequence in which we see a garish Las Vegas overrun by Zombies. This title sequence packs in a lot of story; in fact, in packs in about 90% of the movie's story.After that a bunch of people decide to go into Zombie-infested Vegas to get some loose cash, which is what the rest of the movie is. In spite of the absence of story, there's still a long chunk of time between the credits and the action which is filled with the strikingly dull enlisting of cannon fodder.You might have a few questions as the movie begins. Are the protagonists being mislead by the billionaire who puts this in place? Is the soldier they're forced to take along untrustworthy? Will someone sacrifice themselves for others even though they probably could have saved themselves as well? Will someone risk everyone's lives on a side mission? Will things suddenly become way more urgent? Will the characters be too undeveloped for you to care about them or their mission? Will this all result because no one in the movie even considered the possibility that things weren't what they seem? Will you be unsurprised at the "surprise" ending?If you don't know the answer to any of these questions then you've never seen a movie before and might like this one. Otherwise...There's little attempt to bring these characters to life except in several tediously emotional conversations between two characters you don't care about.Yes, there are some good moments here and there. The aforementioned opening credits. Zombie animals. A quiet scene with an unquiet finale. Occasional moments of good action or suspense. But it all gets suffocated by the length, the slack moments, the predictability, the stupidity, and the high "who cares" quotient.Zack Snyder is a hit or miss director, but normally his failures are from pretention and hubris. This time he didn't fail because he was too ambitious, but because he seemingly had no ambitions at all."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0993840/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","2"," even with a veteran hollywood director, netflix still produces trash ","This movie is a mashup of cliches, tropes, dumb characters and useless subplots. I could tell early on it was going to be bad, but it kept getting worse.Filled with eye-rolling moments, shockingly dumb parts, and things that make no sense. Like a lot. A lot a lot. Including parts that could have changed the entire course of the movie if the characters weren't so dumb in this poorly written script. They even do the anime trope of providing a ridiculous and unnecessary countdown to a deadline that they don't seem to follow at allHow could i forget... almost every single attempt at comedy fell completely flat. Not a chuckle, not even a smirk. Somewhere between crickets and rolling my eyes. And there was one comedic character that was one of the least comedic comedic characters i've ever seen.There were some cool action scenes but not too many. I liked the stylized gore (reminded me of spartacus). The movie was way too long due to the useless subplots. But even if it was shorter, there was nothing special here. Everything felt a little off. And i cared zero for any of the characters or their well-beings. (1 viewing, 5/31/2021)SPOILERSi decided to list some of the most memorable dumb parts:-when tanaka's guy betrayed the girl, they abandoned her when they could have easily saved her. And even worse, she stares into the eyes of her friend before she is killed and decides not to warn them that he might betray them all. Their lives are all in danger, but nah, let's just enjoy the moment-speaking of staring into each other's eyes, when bautista and his daughter get to the chopper and instead of immediately leaving they decide to have a moment which likely got him killed-right after that moment, zombie leader runs towards them as the pilot tries to leave as slowly as possible. But once the zombie is on board, she goes to fast-right before that moment, bautista brings his daughter to the chopper which is gone. "she left us." hmmmmmm i wonder if they are gonna do the fake-out where she comes back just when we thought all is lost.-multiple cringe-worthy self-sacrifice cliches-one guy shot a zombie in the eye and chin, underneath was a glowing blue eye and a metal chin. Yes, just like a terminator. I even paused it and went frame by frame to confirm. Makes no sense. Unless that's a hint about what ghost from power said earlier about a loop of the same mission. If so.... BOOOOOO-not so much a moment, but the entire subplot of saving the refugee mom was so pointless. Even worse, they didn't show us a scene of her reuniting with her kids, or even that she survives at all! In fact, the daughter character could have been completely removed without taking anything away from the movie other than runtime.-we need to get a zombie to activate the booby traps.... or we can just use one of these numerous dead bodies to do the same thing without the dangers of capturing a live zombie. Smh-the secret purpose of the mission is to get a zombie head. That could have been accomplished in 5 minutes without the elaborate money and safe-cracking-the zombie tiger did nothing for me. And that's coming from someone who loves tigers. It reminded me of a crappy version of the bear from the movie annihilation, which was legitimately terrifying.-the president decides to do the nuke a day early? Are you KIDDING ME?-they have an hour and 20 minutes to leave. Cracking the safe needs 30 minutes, which he seems to do in time. But now they have 20 minutes-in this 20 minutes they need to take this entire room full of cash to the roof. How is that going to happen?-they act like they successfully got the money, but it was one guy holding two backpacks, which were lost when the zombies ripped them open. They made it seem like that's the moment the money was lost. But it was an entire room full of money. And they showed that room later on, still filled with money.-there are probably 20 more things but i can't remember them."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0993840/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","2"," Zombie Heist: A Movie Robbed of Its Brains ","Zack Snyder doesn't need an editor to enforce cuts because a movie around two-and-a-half hours is too long; he needs one because movies such as "Army of the Dead" are bad. The smarter zombies get, I swear, the stupider the movies are. Instead of the reanimated corpses being about something, we get zombies plus a heist flick--plus a father-daughter reunion and other who-cares dramatic arcs. Some of it's ironic, but that's about it. As if this sort of shoot-'em-in-the-head undead junk weren't formulaic enough, now we must endure the assembling of a team for the heist, the double crosses and switcheroos. And that's just before every character seems to think a deadly crisis is a good time to clear the air with their personal grievances or to pause for a gander during one of Snyder's many slow-mo or blurry playing-with-the-focus shots just long enough for a ghoul to sneak up on them. The real zombification here is us being entertained by this dreck.What's the point of the TV news clips of politicos Donna Brazile and Sean Spicer debating refugees, or reading off a witless quotation from the U. S. president regarding nuking Las Vegas, or why even set this mess in that highly-symbolic "sin" city if it's not a sustained commentary on anything? Is the point merely that it's all a spectacle? If that's the case, it's all downhill after the slow-mo montage to "Viva Las Vegas" during the opening credits. Quite disappointing coming from a filmmaker who managed to infuse the superhero genre with a bit of politics to better effect as in "Watchmen" (2009) and the overly-maligned "Man of Steel" (2013). Even "300" (2006) seemed like it was about something else, whether or not one found it off-putting. There need not be a social or political commentary, either, nor an environmental or pandemic-related one, but there should be something if one is going to pompously drag out the action.I wish I could say I was even rooting for the undead here, what with the human characters being uniformly unlikeable, but Snyder's continued fascination with zombie babies is as uninteresting. A CGI zombie tiger and a zombie boss clever enough to wear a helmet (although apparently not clever enough to have his mindless followers also wear them) may be cool only at first glance--it gets tiresome after that. It's even worse than his overrated "Dawn of the Dead" (2004) remake. There, at least, a semblance of George Romero's much-better 1978 original may've remained in Snyder's mindless action-oriented reengineering.P. S. I'm relieved I don't need to read my TV warranty, but I'm still deducting a star here for Snyder and company leaving those dead pixels in the picture to make me worry in the first place."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0993840/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt"," Good, Dumb, Fun Zombie Extravaganza ","Oozing with a gung-ho attitude, smeared with a brawny touch, and brimming with an unabashed brainlessness, Army of the Dead has all the hallmarks of a silly, idiotic & extravagantly dumb yet fun blockbuster with a bonkers premise & stupid characters to steer the adventure and not only does it deliver what it set out to do but also does so with panache & near-fatal overdose of style.Co-written, directed & photographed by Zack Snyder, the film opens on a promising note and is crisply detailed, visually striking & jam-packed with all his trademarks in addition to being self-indulgent, over-the-top & excessive. But as it moves forward, it turns into this plodding, predictable & poorly edited mess that despite providing lots of kills, thrills & genre mash-ups never truly manages to grab a flesh-tearing bite.Its 148 mins runtime is in no way justified and its attempts at emotional moments are laughable. The humour hits the sweet spot on few occasions. Violence & gore is present in plenty. Performances are serviceable at best. And while there is an attempt to do something interesting with the undead, the execution is more of a hit-or-miss, for it works from a stylistic viewpoint but doesn't really improve the experience by much.Overall, Army of the Dead isn't memorable in any way, shape or form but it delivers a lighthearted popcorn entertainer that will amuse many if not all. Snyder as always goes for a glorious, larger-than-life depiction that gives the images an extra richness on the surface even if they are hollow from within. But that doesn't mean one can't enjoy it wholeheartedly. It has its frustrating bits but it definitely makes for a much breezier & satisfying ride if you just decide to go with the flow."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0993840/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," Fun enough, but has almost as many plot holes as bullet holes ","Zack Snyder's Dawn of the Dead is one of my favorite zombie movies of all time. Army of the Dead is fun enough, but it has almost as many plot holes as bullet holes. And as the story issues pile up, they become more difficult to ignore. This movie also runs too long, dragging its feet and ambling around in circles at times. I feel like Netflix gave Snyder a little too much slack on his filmmaking leash with this one."

It was also more serious in tone then i thought it will be.Overall, "Army of the Dead" for me was very entertaining movie.

I love how Stylish so much of the movie is although some of it is weirder than most zombie types. Maybe there's a lot to hate on but I don't see it probably won't I'm even one of very few that loves the way Dexter ended! Seriously even though nearly everyone dies the same thing happened in Dawn of the Dead they take a boat at the end and find out it's swarmed by zombies; just enjoy the awesome cinematic experience!"

","Granted, with a movie such as "Chinese Speaking Vampires", then I wasn't really expecting this 2021 to prove to be a phenomenal and outstanding cinema moment. But since it was a movie that I hadn't already seen, then of course I found the time to sit down and watch it.And while I managed to sit through the entire movie, I can only claim to be mildly entertained. Writer Davy Williams didn't exactly come up with a ground-breaking storyline here. Sure, there were the odd funny moment here and there throughout the course of the movie, but it didn't feel like this was supposed to be a funny movie. So if that is the case, and "Chinese Speaking Vampires" is supposed to be a full-blown serious movie, then director Randy Kent definitely had his hands full.The storyline in this movie was just so far out there, and it definitely had potential to be one of those movies so bad they become enjoyable and fun to watch. But "Chinese Speaking Vampires" just never fully transcended into that area. Which made for a somewhat odd movie experience. Things that took place in the storyline were so far out there and ludicrous, that I didn't know if I was supposed to take it as a spoof or actually take it seriously.The acting in the movie was adequate, that definitely was one of the stronger sides to "Chinese Speaking Vampires". I will say that Davy Williams (playing Tony) and June Lee (playing Reika) were actually the two most outstanding performers in the movie.While "Chinese Speaking Vampires" was watchable, it just didn't really have what mattered, and the movie fell just short of being mediocre. As such, then I am rating "Chinese Speaking Vampires" a four out of ten stars. It is hardly a movie that you'll watch more than once."

Instead this a dark comedy is devoid of any laughs. The only joke I could see is the one on the viewer that accidentally stumbled on this film. It is just plain bad & a money grabbing film that tries, & fails, to bring Eastern and Western film makers to crack Hollywood.It may be considered an attempt to bring back Hong Kong Exploitation films that had died out many decades ago (& that is for good reasons). This would have been rejected had it been released in that golden era of this genre. Please avoid & I wasted my time watching it so you could avoid doing likewise."

If you liked "Hobo with a Shotgun", Kung Fury", or "The Room", you might consider adding this to your list of entertaining train wrecks.The dialogue, while not a novel idea, was interesting with the switch between languages. The editing was the most professional part of the movie, and I've never said that about any movie ever.Favorite line from the movie: "You're the worst dead boyfriend alive." by Zara (Rezzan Denizmen) The script could have used more zingers like that.The "Zero Point" sign behind the receptionist sums the whole movie up.

Perhaps with a better Director, and script it could have been.It had one thing going for it, an interesting concept. Sadly what could have been a great idea was let down by wooden acting with no true emotional content. A script with terrible dialogue, that only had a few good lines in the entire film. Fight scenes that had never come across the concept of choreography, or proper camera angles, or being able to sell the delivery of a shot. Then there was the exceptionally low, low, low budget locations. It looked like the entire budget for locations was for drone footage in the introduction, and only about six poorly chosen locations, a mall concourse, a bar scene, coffee shop, room for the language class, bad guys office, and warehouse.The bad guy was somewhat entertaining, and really sold his Corny Mandarin accented English speech about Dominating the World. I gave it an extra star for the corny Mandarin bad guy!!! The countering interest of an Evangelist was pretty lame. Not and extra star kind of lame, more the pathetic kind.I could go on about the action hero, his sidekicks, and his love interest, but there is really no point."

Sheriff's Department homicide detective Jim Baxter (Rami Malek) investigates a murder. Kern County deputy sheriff Joe "Deke" Deacon (Denzel Washington) happens to be in town to retrieve evidence for another case. He's a former detective from LASD but left after some unspecified incident. He finds Jim's case to be connected to his former case. The two starts to suspect Albert Sparma (Jared Leto) who drives a muscle car to be a serial killer.This is trying to be Se7en and True Detective and other high concept crime mystery with a twist. It's interesting in some aspects but falters in others. First and foremost, this is not a whodunnit. The movie piles on all the suspicion on Sparma with only a small wink at the fingerprint guy. Quite frankly, it's either Sparma or not Sparma. Anyone else would be meaningless anyways. There is some hope of turning this into a character study of these three people. That's a 50/50 proposition in this case. Denzel can sleepwalk through this role and I'm not saying that he is. I'm also not saying that he isn't. With Rami and Jared, the film has two of the most outlier actors around. It may be one too many. They are pushing very hard and at times, they push the movie over the edge. Finally, I have issues with the final confrontation. There are problems with it and I don't like it. Nevertheless, I still like the three actors and it's always interesting to see them go to work."

","I think the naysayers for this movie are somewhat missing the point, the story behind the story as it were. Yes, it's a murder mystery, but beyond that it's about Joe 'Deke' Deacon (Denzel Washington) attempting to prevent fellow law officer Jim Baxter (Rami Malek) from falling into the same depressing frame of mind that's been his personal torment for the past five years. In an admittedly very dark scene in the latter half of the picture, a flashback depicts how Deke accidentally shot an innocent person in the course of hunting down a murderer. Deke's guilt over the fact, even after a coroner fabricated the cause of death, was enough to force him into an unintended leave from the department and the breakup of his marriage. Landing a position in a lesser capacity at a police department in a nearby county, Deke gets involved in a murder case when he's sent on a gopher mission to pick up evidence in Los Angeles. He gets a mixed reaction from his former colleagues, while initially getting the cold shoulder treatment from Baxter, a hot shot detective with the slightest hint of superiority.As the serial murder investigation in LA appears to narrow down to a likely suspect, both Deke and Baxter seek to make the pieces fit against the slimy Albert Leonard Sparma (Jared Leto). Sparma manages to outmaneuver the pair of frustrated cops with an infuriating display of conceit and arrogance, leading Baxter to try a different approach. Sparma's insistence that a murder victim is buried in a lonely desert location leads Baxter to dig up nearly a dozen parcels of empty dirt. With his frustration and anger mounting, Baxter decks Sparma with a shovel, unintentionally killing him. Deke, who was present and witness to the Sparma's death, returns to the city in Sparma's vehicle to cover Baxter's tracks. In doing so, Deke reveals a dishonorable side to his character, especially with his advice to Baxter to 'forget about' Sparma and move on with his career. To pinpoint blame where both cops thought it should have belonged, Deke buys a red barrette that one of the murder victims wore, and has it delivered to Jim in an attempt to assuage some of his guilt. One's sense is that this won't be enough to relieve Baxter's remorse for acting impulsively, his sense of self worth completely shattered by the experience.The idea that Sparma was guilty or innocent of the series of murders in LA and Fern County is left an open question to my mind. He may have been the killer, but with no tangible evidence, he felt compelled to inflame the pair of cops breathing down his neck. If you paid attention, the film's sound track seemed to support the idea that Deke and Jim were on the right trail. Not only did Deke have a fondness for nostalgic Sixties music, but the ones heard on the radio in Baxter's car included 'My Guy' and 'I Will Follow Him', affirming the idea that they were soon to get their man."

Except that, you know, Seven* is the kind of movie that will live on in cinema lovers' minds for, well, ever and this movie won't stay in your brain longer than it takes to watch it. Hopefully.Ah, HBO Max. For all the sturm and drang and handwringing given over to your plan to play movies at the same time they make it to theaters. Well, between this and Wonder Woman 1984, they're exactly zero for two.The comparisons between the films went the whole way to interviews with writer and director John Lee Hancock, who claimed that he wrote this way before Fincher's movie forever transformed serial killer procedurals. It was originally to be a Clint Eastwood vehicle and then a Steven Spielberg movie and then, well, it sat around for some time.This movie is set in 1993, which you'll know because there's a No Doubt flyer on the victim's fridge but not because the lead detective's house looks like it was built last year. That time incongruity is the least of this film's problems. In fact, if you told me it was set in 2020, I'd believe you just as quickly as if you'd say 1993.Joseph "Deke" Deacon (Denzel Washington) is a man whose detective career has ruined his life and the lives of everyone around him, pushing him away from Los Angeles and into the outskirts of town, dealing with crimes as simple minded as the Black Angus Restaurant continually needing to replace the g.While back in the city to pick up evidence, Deacon comes into the orbit of the man who replaced him, Detective Jim Baxter (Rami Malek). You know how that works, what with people being able to move from county to county on cases, jurisdiction be damned.There's a killer painting ip his victims and that killer might be Albert Sparma (Jared Leto), who fits every expectation of what a loner killer should look and act like. But is he guilty? He's an unreliable suspect who is so obsessed with criminal behavior that he confessed to a crime he could have never committed once before.So what do two good - we hope they are - men do to put away one bad - we hope he is - man? A lot of nothing, as it turns out.Far be it from me to condemn movies where nothing happens for long stretches of time. That would pretty much describe 99% of the drive-in and grindhouse movies I love, which feature travelogue footage, unnecessary b-roll and long go nowhere scenes that follow each performer each time they walk anywhere.This film somehow feels longer than five of them in a row while overdosing on Klonopin.The thing is, if this were a small budget film with no name actors, it wouldn't make a blip on the rader. But this feature three acting powerhouses and a well-considered writer and director at the helm. And for all that gasoline in the tank, the car is going nowhere fast. And even worse, the car is not special nor does it possess anything that you haven't seen in every other car that looks exactly like it.I realize that not every movie can rock your world. But they should at least try. This has Leto playing, well, Leto. At least I hope that he didn't send used condoms and dead rodents to Denzel and Malek like he did to his co-stars in Suicide Squad.Also, and this is a silly complaint, but I couldn't understand a word Malek said. In Bohemian Rhapsody, I chalked that up to him having to get teeth like Freddie Mercury. I can more easily divine what Bane says than his character in this movie.Movies can be dumb. They can have plot holes. They can have horrible special effects, bad continuity, laughable performances. But the worst thing a movie can be is boring. And I fear that this entire day has all been a dream and somewhere, I am still watching this movie and will soon find myself waking up to having to watch it all again.*I know I'm supposed to write this as Se7en but that makes my fingers hurt."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10016180/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," The devil is in the detail... ","I was quite intrigued by the trailer for this. Somehow, though, they seem to have managed to squash all that's interesting about the film into it... It reminded me a great deal of "Se7en" (1995) with Denzel Washington "Deke" a former detective with a history that resulted in him being relegated to a rural uniformed role. He is despatched to the big city to collect some evidence whereupon he becomes embroiled in an investigation led by the cocky "Baxter" (a rather wooden Rami Malek) into a series of brutal killings. The title of the film is the gist of Washington's character - he is methodical and detailed in his methods, and together this unlikely alliance starts to bear fruit - they get their suspect, but he (Jared Leto) is no fool, and soon the game of cat and mouse leaves us uncertain as to whom is pulling who's strings. The first half-hour is quite well structured and effective, we get a sense of the mystery and the two stars gel quite well together. The second hour of the film, though, is really pretty poor with an ending that I felt really let the whole thing down. Any semblance of plausibility is sacrificed, almost as if director John Lee Hancock felt he was running out of time so had to cram too much into the closing stages - and so we are left with a hastily cobbled together conclusion that really underwhelms. Not a film you need bother seeing in the cinema - it is bound to be on a streaming service shortly to help you kill 2 hours."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10016180/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Procedural with a Sour Grapes Finale ",""The Blind Side" writer & director John Lee Hancock has made his homage to director David Fincher's gruesome serial killer thriller "Se7en" (1995), co-starring Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman. Not only does Hancock's thoroughly suspenseful film "The Little Things," starring Denzel Washington, Rami Malik, and Jared Leto, surpass Fincher's cult classic, but also its content is not as graphic. Despite its powerhouse cast and its surprise ending, "The Little Things" amounts to a psychological exercise in detective work more than a physical actioneer, jam-packed with bloody shootouts and careening car chases. Two unlikely detectives who've never met join forces to catch a murder suspect. The irony is the suspect yearns to be caught. Just watching these three actors in the same movie is worth the price of admission. Jared Leto steals the show with his sinister laid-back performance. Unfortunately, the sour grapes ending may prove less succulent for law & order enthusiasts. Nobody wants to watch a period police procedural where the cops don't solve the case. Of course, you watch movies like "The Little Things" because you want the cops to nab the criminal. Instead, Hancock defies our expectations and depicts the police in a less than heroic light. So it should come as no surprise that most audiences will feel cheated? Clocking in at two hours and seven minutes, Hancock's offbeat neo-noir crime thriller smolders with suspense. Suddenly, everything goes sideways, with a shocking, double whammy of an ending which both stuns and amazes. Most mainstream serial killer sagas, such as Michael Mann's "Manhunter" (1986), starring William L. Peterson, salute the cops who catch their quarry. When the authorities fail, the filmgoing experience feels less fulfilling. Movies like "The Little Things" with atypical endings constitute 'arthouse epics' because they don't aim for the mainstream.Joe Deacon (Denzel Washington of "Training Day") was a high-profile Los Angeles Sheriff's Department homicide detective until he made a tragic mistake in the line of duty five years ago. Without spoiling anything, this exposure may bias your sentiments about Denzel's character. You'll have to bide your time for those revelations when they come during the final quarter-hour. Meantime, the bottom dropped out of Deke's career. He lost his two daughters because his wife divorced him. Later, he survived triple-bypass heart surgery! Afterward, he landed a patrolman's job in Kern county. "The Little Things" revolves around truth and consequences. Once an illustrious detective, Deke lives alone now on the edge of the desert near Bakersfield, in Kern County, California, about 100 miles from Los Angeles. Deke's boss Captain Henry Davis (Glenn Morshower of "Black Hawk Down") sends him back to his old stomping grounds to retrieve crime scene evidence. When he enters his old precinct, Deke gets the cold shoulder from his former boss, LASD Captain Carl Farris (Terry Kinney of "Sleepers"), who wants him off the premises as soon as possible. While he is hanging around, Deke spots his replacement, Sergeant Jim Baxter (Rami Malek of "Bohemian Rhapsody"), a fastidious dresser, conducting a press conference about a serial killer who has slain four women. Initially, Baxter isn't impressed with plain Joe Deacon. In fact, Baxter almost had Deke's GMC truck towed for blocking his unmarked car. Meantime, Farris warns Baxter that Deke is a "rush hour train wreck." As it turns out, the evidence is wrapped up in red tape, so Deke must spend the night. Nevertheless, conflicted as he is about the older detective, Baxter befriends Deke. He invites him to inspect his latest crime scene involving a woman slaughtered in her own apartment. Deke may be a persona non grata, but he's still a shrewd detective. When he visits the crime scene again, Deke asks about the broken fridge. The landlady explains the girl died before the repairman came to fix it. Afterward, Deke prowls an appliance shop and develops a lead: a stringy-haired, pot-bellied, grease monkey, Albert Sparma (Jared Leto of "Dallas Buyers Club"), who resembles an unkempt Jim Morrison.The two obsessed detectives struggle to build a case against Sparma. Eight years earlier, Sparma confessed to a murder. Nevertheless, the authorities threw out the case because they couldn't link him to the crime scene with physical evidence. Moreover, they caught Sparma lying about his part in the homicide. When the LASD brings him in for questioning, Sparma toys with them and calls himself "a crime buff." Amusing himself, Sparma plays a game of cat & mouse with Deke and Baxter. He enjoys looking at the crime scene photos of the dead woman. Deke realizes Sparma is ogling the photos lasciviously. Slamming him against the wall, Deke accuses Sparma of the dead girl's murder. Jared Leto's impassive villain doesn't fight back, and he ambles out of the interrogation room. Later, Deke convinces Baxter to distract Sparma long enough so he can search the low-lifer's apartment. When Baxter doesn't keep his rendezvous with the slippery repairman, Sparma rings 911 and alerts the LAPD about a wounded officer who has been shot on his premises. Scrambling out of the apartment and over the roof before several uniforms raid Sparma's place, Deke manages a narrow escape."The Little Things" isn't sympathetic to the police. Not only do the boys in blue blunder, but also their blunders pose serious blowbacks. Ultimately, they emerge from their game of cat & mouse with Sparma no better than criminals because they conceal their own crimes. Ironically, Hancock penned this procedural back in 1993, when life seemed far less complicated before the COVID pandemic. Anybody who has seen "Se7en" will spot the unmistakable resemblance between Rami Malek's young, hot-headed detective, who flies into a rage at the least provocation, and Brad Pitt's fledgling, loose cannon investigator. Each behaves like judge, jury, and executioner. Mind you, despite its less than savory ending that armchair sleuths will abhor, "The Little Things" remains a superbly crafted film without any of the gruesome violence in "Se7en.""

The two of them cross paths at the L.A. County Sheriffs Department where they just may be able to help each other.Denzel Washington plays Joe Deacon, a Bakersfield P.D. deputy who used to be an L.A. County homicide detective. He was sent to L.A. to pick up some evidence and found himself right in the middle of a murder investigation. The anonymous murderer preys upon young women. The case is being handled by a hotshot young detective named Jimmy Baxter (Rami Malek) who doesn't mind the help of an old veteran like Deacon.The movie is more about obsession and letting something consume you. Deacon had been obsessed with a case and it drove him to a divorce and a heart attack. He would obsess over everything, the big and the little things. Baxter, now having a widely publicized case, was also beginning to get dragged in too deep with some help from Deacon.This movie had some fine performances from all involved. The pacing was good for a murder mystery. I'm not quite sure what I was looking for from this movie, but I don't think I found it.

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10016180/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," what haunts you ","Greetings again from the darkness. When a script has bounced around Hollywood for 30 years without getting produced, there is usually a good reason why. Written by John Lee Hancock in the early 1990s, a handful of directors have been attached at various times, but it's the writer himself who has managed to get it on screen all these years later. Mr. Hancock has found his niche as a director by targeting the precise middle of mainstream with such films as SAVING MR BANKS (2013) and THE BLIND SIDE (2009), an approach more challenging when the topic is chasing a brutal serial killer.Of course, casting three Oscar winning actors is always a wise choice. Two-time Oscar winner Denzel Washington (TRAINING DAY, 2001, GLORY, 1989) stars as Joe Deacon, a defrocked L.A. homicide detective banished to the California desert as a Deputy Sheriff in Kern County. "Deke" suffered a heart attack, went through a divorce, and lost his job as a result of being haunted by an especially grisly unsolved case. When Deacon is tasked to pick up evidence in Los Angeles, he stumbles into a case being worked by his hotshot replacement, Jim Baxter. Oscar winner Rami Malek (BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY, 2018) brings his unorthodox mannerisms to the role and soon (and unsurprisingly) the 'old school' and 'next gen' detectives are teaming up to work a serial killer case with (unsurprising) similarities to Deke's old case.Denzel is especially effective in the first half of the film. His Deke is a quiet man with extraordinary observational and listening skills, and he brings none of his patented histrionics to the role. Deke's 'little things' process quickly identifies a suspect, and it's a doozy. Oscar winner Jared Leto (DALLAS BUYERS CLUB, 2013) is Albert Sparma, a greasy-haired appliance repair man (who let's this guy in their house?) with a penchant for following news of the city's crimes. Soon enough he's taunting Deke and Baxter, and enjoying every minute of their frustration at the lack of evidence. It's the cat and mouse game we've seen many times.I'm a fan of retro movies, and Hancock announces upfront that this one is set in 1990. There are two reasons for this: that's the era when he wrote the script, and it corresponds to a time when the Night Stalker was fresh on the minds of L.A. citizens. (side note: Netflix is currently showing the superb docuseries, "Night Stalker: The Hunt for a Serial Killer"). The idea of mismatched partners with polar opposite personalities is another aspect that we are quite familiar with, and Hancock even uses flashbacks to show us exactly what haunts Deke.Supporting work comes from Chris Bauer, Terry Kinney, Glenn Morshower, Natalie Morales, and Michael Hyatt, with the latter two providing a non-victim female presence - although neither is given much to do. The most interesting aspect of the story is how Baxter is falling into the same emotional void as his new mentor, but unfortunately, not much time is devoted to this. In fact, the story has very little to keep us interested, and instead that burden falls to Washington, Malek, and Leto. Hancock has delivered a dark, brooding crime thriller that fails to deliver the thrills. It certainly pales in the obvious comparisons to David Fincher's Fincher's SE7EN (1995) and ZODIAC (2007), but is fine for killing time while stuck at home during a pandemic.

Deke's keen sense for the "little things" proves accurate, but his willingness to circumvent the rules pushes Baxter into a frightening dilemma, while, Deke must wrestle with a dark secret from his past.Washington, Malek, and Leto give fine performances, aided by some stand out support by Michael Hyatt (wholly credible in her role as a medical examiner bonded to Deke), Chris Bauer, Terry Kinney, Isabel Arraiza and more. There is a problem with the writing and the directing in that the storyline wanders and the impact of Deke's former actions that mirror Baxter's current obsession lessens as the film flows on: both beg for some tightening in execution. The concept is solid: the end result is flawed. Grady Harp."

Denzel Washington, Rami Malek and most certainly an almost unrecognizable Jared Leto did a great job playing their characters. There's also a good amount of suspense which keeps your attention. That said the ending isn't really a satisfying ending. I'm glad I'm not the only one that thinks that. There was clearly something missing in the last part and that's a pity because The Little Things could have been much better. Now it's just a good movie worth watching, but it's not exceptional like it could have been."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10016180/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt"," Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote. "," No Angels ","A pattern in "The Little Things" is that "accidents happen." The protagonist, Joe "Deke" Deacon, is a cop with a deep, dark secret. While working as a detective in Los Angeles, Deke was on the trail of a serial killer and was walking through a wooded area. He was distracted by the voice of one of his fellow cops when a figure emerged in front of him. Deke shot first, then asked the basic question second: Whom did I just kill? Sadly, it was one of the young women he was trying to rescue from the killer.Fast forward to the present after the passing of many years. Deke now works as a deputy in Kern County. When he is sent on an errand to Los Angeles, Deke is linked up to Jimmy Baxter, the hot shot detective who replaced him. A serial killer is on the loose, and Deke decides to stay over the weekend to assist Jimmy. Deke leaves his poor dog uncared for back in Kern County.Although Denzel Washington is terrific in the role of Deke, the film's action was slow-paced as history repeated itself. Now, it is Jimmy's turn to make an ill-starred decision as lead detective. He follows the prime suspect to a secluded area where the weirdo Albert Sparma promises to reveal the grave of his latest victim. Jimmy gets frustrated after digging to no avail, then loses his temper and hits Sparma over the head with the shovel. The suspect is dead, and Deke arrives on cue to help Jimmy to bury the body and give the appearance that Sparma had left town.Within the police department, Deke originally had assistance from both his captain and the coroner who discarded the bullet fragment recovered from the body of the deceased woman killed by Deke. Deke is then conveniently transferred out of L. A. Were the filmmakers consciously trying to make a statement about the incompetent and amoral creatures known as the Los Angeles police?The mantra of Deke is that the "little things" matter in police detective work. They also apparently matter in cover-ups. Prior to his return to Kern County, Deke leaves behind a succinct note for the nearly comatose Jimmy. The note reads as follows: "No Angels." Apparently, Deke's worldview is governed by the principle that "accidents happen" and there will be no responsibility for one's actions if one is only mindful of "the little things.""
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10016180/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt"," It's a little thriller with big stars. Fun if you don't ask too much of it. ",""It's the little things that are important, Jimmy. It's the little things that get you caught." Joe "Deke" Deacon (Denzel Washington) The Little Things wants to be a psychological thriller, and it is. Its only problem is it wants too badly to make Deke more world-weary than Morgan Freeman's Somerset in Se7en and Jim (Rami Malek) more intense than callow Mills (Brad Pitt) from the same psychological who dun it. All are cops gone over the top in their search for a serial killer, the picture eluding and playing with their inadequacies. The big difference is in the experience of the directors and actors.Albert Sparma (Jared Leto) may or may not be the killer detectives in The Little Things want to get out of professional pride and personal guilt. However, the cops are mainly moved to pursue Sparma because he has a habit of confessing to crimes he didn't commit, where the cops have skeletons of their own.The Little Things is best when Deke and Jim spar over the evidence, Deke having the requisite wisdom of age and Jim the energy of youthful righteousness. Although it's not always clear where writer/director John Lee Handcock is going, he does capture the individually dangerous quirks and motives of the three leads. Each has been given a second chance with the danger of falling back into the grime of conscience and evil.The atmosphere is dark noir and the ambition barely lacking; the characters do give a sense of directed outrage at crime. Here is a world not dictated by women or love but rather a primordial revenge on behalf of women and a personal guilt evidenced in a mortal accident in Deke's early career that dogs him to the present.Although critics may wail at the derivative elements of this film, most specifically the influences of Se7en and The Bone Collector and peripherally Nightcrawler, the film has a unique buddying motif of older and younger cops anchored in Oscar-winning actors so temperamentally different that it seems as if the partner motif is done for the first time. Even Jared Leto, who has played a wacko now and then in his career, seems fresh here, restraining himself from his usual showboating.Derivative as The Little Things may be, it is still worth a Dolby Theater matinee price as long as you're with a long-time buddy who also appreciates the darkly eccentric crime show."Who says that bad guys don't return to the scene of the crime?"

Kene County Deputy Sheriff John 'Deke' Deacon (Denzel Washington) is a burnt out cop, who pushed himself to a heart attack after becoming embroiled in a case, who finds himself sent down to LA on a simple evidence gathering assignment, only to lock horns with hotshot young LASD detective Jim Baxter (Remi Malek) who's eager to make an impression. Deacon ends up lending his expertise in catching the killer, only to dredge up a dark secret from his past.No genre staple in the thriller department has ever proven quite as inexhaustible as the serial killer plot line. No end of fresh takes on the theme continue to saturate the literary and film worlds. And here writer/director John Lee Hancock delivers his contribution to the screen, that passed by without much fanfare as the cinemas cautiously reopened again. And, despite the best intentions, that ultimately might be just as well for everyone.On the surface, all the right ingredients are in place to have a decent stab at a worthy effort at reworking the formula to produce something memorable, but the result is a dull, uninvolving effort that fails to tread any new ground or generate any sense of tension or suspense. At its considerable length, that's a real problem. Even the usually energetic Washington doesn't seem to be feeling it, with more dynamism from rising co star Malik, who still doesn't quite have the star gravitas to get top billing over his co star. There are subtle nods to superior sk films from times before (such as the girl driving and singing at the beginning, a la Silence of the Lambs) which only adds to its woes, and by the end Hancock's pretentiously trying to aim for some film noir vibe, infusing some old soul classics over the soundtrack, apparently sensing the mystery itself isn't captivating enough.While the lead protagonist might theorise how it's the 'little things' that ultimately lead to cases being solved at the non-payoff of an ending, in reality it's sadly what leads to films not being the sum of their parts. **"

Terrified she leaves the car and tries to hide in the brushwood while her pursuer ponderously searches for her, walking like Frankenstein's monster and carrying a lantern in his hand...It's a reasonable, if hardly original beginning to the film. Next morning, still unsure of the girl's fate, we're introduced to Denzel Washington's middle-aged, workaday uniformed cop, Joe "Deke" Deacon, performing gopher tasks for his truculent boss. We learn he's a live-alone burn-out, transferred and bumped down the ranks for reasons which become clear later. When he's sent to the big smoke to pick up some routine item of evidence he encounters Rami Malek's young hot-shot detective, Jim Baxter, who's investigating a serial killer. More young women are either disappearing or turning up dead, recalling to Denzel the unsolved case which broke him five years ago. After the obligatory testy first encounter between them, the two hook up with Malek inviting Washington to the latest murder scene where, naturally, Washington, in his unconventional way aids the investigation and with his fetching task no longer required, makes a busman's holiday of some holiday time he's due, to join Malek's team.It's not long before a prime suspect moseys into view, Jared Leto's Manson-like Albert Sperma and Malek becomes convinced that he's their "boy". But is he and if so how to prove it? Leto's character is slippery and into playing games with both detectives, but who will crack first?The film has the slow-burn dark pacing we've seen several times before going all the way back to "Se7en". There's little new ground covered in that respect but the film does have an interesting ending in its depiction of the processing of guilt. I found it heavy going at times and didn't swallow some of the narrative turns, like when Washington breaks into Leto's flat and most particularly at the climax with Malek and Leto doing that drawn-out Harry Potter v Voldemort stand-off thing at the dead of night in the middle of nowhere. On the other hand, I did like the device of Washington's "ghosts of cases past" speaking to him.Washington and Leto put in strong performances, Malek slightly less so. I also felt the direction could have been tighter but did appreciate the atmospheric soundtrack which helped to heighten the tension.More about the psychological than the thriller, in the end it might have been better served by beefing up the latter at the expense of the former."

It's a slow, handsome-looking film, so determined not to be sensational that it veers towards the dull side. The writer and director is John Lee Hancock so I guess the blame lies largely with him.Denzel's character, the great detective whose intuation is almost superhuman, is a cliche too far; he's now the right age to channel his inner Morgan Freeman while Malek is just sleep-walking through his role. Leto, however, is outstanding, giving the movie a much needed kick as well as a touch of class, acting his co-stars off the screen though that fine and underrated actor Terry Kinney gives a lift to his few scenes as Malek's boss.

It having the uninspired quality of a 1990s lesser crime drama variation of "Seven" (1995) to it (indeed, it was originally written and appears to be set in that decade), I could imagine being satisfied waiting a few months to rent a VHS copy of it, or not seeing it at all. Starring Denzel Washington, Rami Malek and Jared Leto, there's a lot of Oscar-winning talent wasted here. Washington gets one brief characteristic outburst during an interrogation where he seems to break character to play the caricature of himself he often plays, but for the most part everyone is relatively subdued. It's a run-of-the-mill serial killer murder mystery with hardly any artistry to remark upon. Even the supposed ambiguities or uncertainties are uninteresting. The little things of this genre piece may be there, but there's no bigger picture to validate it."

Also the disappearance stories are interesting. They're like Absentia the movie meets Skinwalker Ranch the movie. A nice tension is built up that's engrossing. A couple just bought a house and the wife goes missing. The husband is befuddled because she appeared to vanish in the blink of an eye. Turns out she's not the only one."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10022716/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," 100% Beleivable Acting ","Most low budget movies have terrible actors as do some medium budget movies. What set this Mocumrntary apart was the Believability of the actors in this movie. Not only were all the actors good, they were believable. Particularly the actors posing as Locals being interviewed who were on screen for scant seconds. They came across as believable and sincere. What is so disappointing is how most of the actors in this movie including the main characters received absolutely no credit on IMDB. The story was well written. The plot was somewhat creepy, it was strange, it was intriguing. The "Home Movie" footage was much more representative of how people would act holding a video camera in a given stressful situation. In so many other movies when Sarah ran across the field and disappeared into the ground the upset Father jumping up and running to where his daughter disappeared would have unbelievably kept the video camera "on subject". Fortunately in this movie the Father jumped up and ran to where his daughter was disregarding the video camera which was aimed at the ground during this time eventually being dropped in the grass: Much more believable of how a person would act in a Panic situation: they would forget about the video camera. Kudos to the Directors Shannon Houchins and Kaiser Whitmire, you two Aces."

While the premise is interesting enough, the plot and execution both were atrocious to say the least.As the movie moves on, they pile up one question after another and resolve none of them. By the end the movie goes into a "What the f?" territory where nothing is resolved and ends in an incredibly anticlimactic way that just ends up leaving a bad taste in your mouth. The movie starts with 1 mystery, but ends with so many of them unresolved. It's a very frustrating watch. The acting itself was pretty mediocre as well, but that's normal when it comes to found footage.Anyway, would NOT recommend. It's just a complete waste of time. 1/10."

If you go into this faux-documentary thinking "Missing 411", you're more equipt for the eventual storyline. And if you've never heard of the "Missing 411" stories, check them out. They're unsolved mysteries of people suddenly going missing, with clues of what happened to them that never seem to add up. Sometimes people are found alive weeks later with no memory of having been gone for vast amounts of time, some are found dead, and some are never found.I think what turns viewers away from this movie is that it's bringing in the wrong crowd. Most start watching this for the documentary aspect of a crime/mystery/thriller and their expectations are poorly met. But if this was marketed towards supernatural, unexplained mysteries, "Missing 411" type of genre, it would fare far better with the viewing audience.You wouldn't label a "Romantic" movie a "Thriller". Generally, women like romance and men like thrillers. What would you expect when you lure the wrong audience in for a thriller and they're stuck watching a romance? Very bad reviews and a low rating. Imo, that's what's happening with this movie, "Howard's Mill".If you like the "Missing 411" series, supernatural phenomenon, and unsolved mysteries, then this movie is for you. And I'm pretty sure you'll enjoy it too."

I don't know if they're worried that it's an one-off but it's better to have more surrealism. I like this movie in general but I would make a few changes.First, I would change the title. Rain is a stupid name for a kid. You're asking for a depressed kid. Then the title is a light-weight play on the name. I would rather they call this "Is this real?". She has her mental checklist where she asks herself if this is possible. It's better to tap into that idea. Second, I would change the opening sequence. I would dive head-first with her mother's hanging. That's how I would open the movie. Being buried alive may be an universal fear but it has no connection to this story.

","Filmed under the title I Saw a Man with Yellow Eyes - yes, there's a bit of a giallo in this - Fear of Rain sat was released in theaters - the ones still open - last week and then went straight to video - yes, they still sell DVDs - and streaming.Written and directed by Castille Landon, this is the story of Rain Burroughs (Madison Iseman, Tales of Halloween, Annabelle Comes Home), a young girl with vivid memories of being chased through the woods by a killer. She wakes in an emergency room with her parents (Katherine Heigl - who is still in movies - and Harry Connick Jr.) and from that moment forward, everything may or may not be real, including love interest Caleb (Israel Broussard, Happy Death Day) and the child being hidden in the attic of her next-door neighbor and teacher Dani McConnell (Eugenie Bondurant).The movie spends most of its time - perhaps too much of it - on Castille's trials in school and in starting to romance Caleb to the point that it never builds McConnell into anything more than a cipher. That said, using the mental illness of the lead to make her an unreliable narrator works for the movie, even if some moments, like the evil version of herself showing up in a mirror, falls into tropes that the movie struggles and mostly succeeds to overcome.Between the dollhouses of McConnell - again, never really explained or explored - and the fact that more than one of the characters in the movie may be living in our heroine's head, this movie does have that one foot in the world of the murder thriller, but never takes the full leap into being fully strange. And that's fine - this is meant for a younger audience and not the devotees of Martino, Argento, Lenzi and Lado. It certainly kept my attention for its running time, which is a testament that few modern movies are able to claim."

Being a teenager battling a severe bout of schizophrenia, now that's something else entirely!Poor old teenage girl Rain however is very much one of these unfortunate souls.Alienated at school because of her seemingly insane nature and wholeheartedly believing that her next door neighbour/teacher is in fact harbouring a small kidnapped child, life isn't easy for Madison Iseman's unlucky Rain, who finds solace in the presence of her mother Michelle and her friendship with the the possibly conjured up Caleb.Directed by still establishing director Castille Landon, Fear of Rain is a low budget affair that has convictions in its motives and enough clout to attract rising star talents Iseman and Broussard as well as sometime A-listers Harry Connick Jr. And Katherine Heigl but while its heart remains in the right place and its late showing twist and turns need to be seen to be believed, Castilee's film is a little too slow out of the blocks and rough around the edges to become the small time indie hit it might've been.Directed in a very po-faced fashion and failing to make the most of Rain's unnerving mindsets (bar a few underutilised flashes of on screen text designed to establish the way Rain thinks on the fly), Fear of Rain had the potential to be a wildly disruptive and energetic affair that gives way far too often to uneventful moments and character beats that halt it in its tracks while we should be glued to our screen trying to figure out just how crazy or sane Rain in fact is.With the most screen-time, both Iseman and Broussard come through the film best with Iseman in particular showcasing a strong leading lady potential but the work of the slumming it Connick Jr. And Heigl leaves a lot to be desired as their parents to Rain Michelle and John fail to make a mark as the two disinterested screen performers clearly couldn't have cared less if they tried.It's a shame these elements didn't align for Fear of Rain to work, the downright bonkers plot and narrative movements had potential to create a real cult hit but as it stands this is a rather tiresome affair that only barely scrapes by.Final Say -Fear of Rain's plot held much potential but its only ever half met at best as a fairly jaw dropping finale and some nice central turns from its young leads helps proceedings along and ensures this low-budget affair didn't sink to low depths it may've sunk too.2 sets of keys out of 5."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10037014/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," VIEWS ON FILM review of Fear of Rain ",""Are you okay?" Me, I'm fine. But the lead in the flick I'm about to review is clearly not. She's in a sad state of affairs and boy it ain't fair. This girl is ill-fated and damned. She is popping pills, hurting herself, and having hallucinations like they're going out of style. Added to that, she has to worry about good old high school make-up work.Anyway, Fear of Rain is my latest write-up. It was released in February of this year and is distributed by Lionsgate. Directed by Florida native Castille Landon, "Rain" is the type of thriller that wanders aimlessly until things conveniently wrap up at the 90-minute-plus mark. The film is a character study about a teenager named Rain (of course). Rain has schizophrenia and while the pic sledgehammers that "beautiful mind" notion, the audience is left with a pretentious, stylistic mess.But hey, that doesn't mean the performances aren't raw, seething, and substantial. Fear of Rain stars Katherine Heigl, Harry Connick Jr., and Madison Iseman. There are some dramatic scenes that play out well between the three and "Rain" does have a few creepy moments. However, director Landon sidesteps her viewing public. She would rather divulge in weird camera angles, intertitles, grainy lightning, misplaced chimeras, and repetitive "voices in the head" stuff ("just kill yourself", "she's lying", "you're gonna die", blah blah blah). "Rain's" story doesn't really move along like it should. It just procrastinates without regard, indulging in phantasm platitudes.I said earlier that Fear of Rain is a character study. Well it also has elements that are too little, too late (like mystery, child abduction, and a twist or two). "Rain" lives and dies by its unintentional tagline of "a figment of your imagination or the real thing". Although well intended and researched, that material got old real fast."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10037014/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," I think I have just developed Ombrophobia after watching this! ","Good acting from the cast especially Harry, who always gives me the creeps but he does well with what little he has to play with. I thought Heigl was persona non grata in Hollywood after her numerous on-set tantrums and disagreements with directors but it seems she has managed to wangle herself back into the low budget afternoon movies for bored housewives and to be fair her plastic surgery and botox has actually been successful unlike poor Angelina Jolie and Nicole Kidman.This comes across as a bit of a Lifetime movie for exactly those housewives as it has no tension, is really slow in development and although it does a decent job of illustrating how terrible having Schizophrenia must be (I like the addition of the handwriting to represent thought in certain scenes; not seen that before) but sadly this is a bit of an average thriller at best.Still it gets a decent rating as always at a standard average 5/10."

The acting was ok, but then again look at the cast, good names there, good dialogue and except some high school scenes, this movie tries as much as possible to avoid clichs. You'll find character development, empathy and most likely by the end, you'll rule for our girl.All in all, Fear of Rain tripped only at the end, quite amazing what weak final act it had, but beside that, I was mostly impressed to be honest. A movie that I will recommend, especially because it managed to show a disease in a way that a viewer might understand it.Cheers!"

For the first like 2/3 of the movie I felt pretty meh because everything was going the way I expected it to. Because of this, I didn't feel on edge, despite the movie's effort to include horror imagery as part of the main character's hallucinations. The main character's way of differentiating reality from hallucination was asking herself three questions, and the movie showed these questions using creepy font. It felt pretty interesting at the beginning, but later didn't add much to the creepiness of the movie.When the twist came, I was pretty surprised, but also confused as to how it could happen for so long. The last third act was fairly suspenseful and got me warm up a little bit. However, it still went down like how I expected.Overall, even though the cast was pretty solid, the stereotypical and predictable plot didn't give the movie much tension or horror. 5.5/10"

Her parents are played by Katherine Heigl (Michelle) & Happy Connick Jr (John Burroughs).Rain believes that she saw something "unusual" occurring in a neighbour's house across from her bedroom window. This is another homage to Albert Hitchcock's Rear Window. The adults around her does not believe her but is it simply her psychosis or did she actually see something that is "real"?! Madison does her best not to give an ott/ clichd performance for that I must applaud her. The cast give a good rounded characters.The storyline is enjoyable but it is nothing ground breaking.

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10037014/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","1"," Terrible portrayal of struggles with mental health ","Let's start with one positive: The cast wasn't terrible, though the acting was very sub-par. Character interactions were awful, but mostly due to poor writing. it's very hard to act well with such bad dialogue. This movie was bad in film terms, in that the dialogue was trash, the plot developments were unbelievable, the world it created was not credible, the shaky camera work did not convey suspense, and the soundtrack was pretty lame. But more than anything, its portrayal of schizophrenia does a HUGE disservice to the mental health community. Anyone who has ever known anyone with schizophrenia or worked in the field of broader mental health is at a disadvantage in attempts to advocate for a better understanding, because of this terrible portrayal. This movie shows everything that you would not do if your loved one was ill, and everything that wouldn't happen if they were refusing medication. In terms of the movie, it probably could have done a better job if it wither stuck to one genre; either Thriller or Drama. It is the attempt to do both that let down the audience. At the end, you feel like you have wasted your time. This may have gotten a better score from me, but its odiously poor job at portraying schizophrenia was too damaging."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10040978/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," Missing the '90s RGV touch!! ","12 'O' Clock review :In the 90s and early 2000s, Ram Gopal Varma (RGV) redefined horror genre in Bollywood with Raat (1992), Bhoot (2003) and Darna Mana Hai (2003). His latest horror offering titled 12 'O' Clock appears like a pale shadow of these super fine films, particularly Raat and Bhoot.A college kiddo (Krishna Gautam) from a lower middle class family gets possessed by a ghost of a psycho killer who goes on a killing rampage. The hapless father (Makarand Deshpande) seeks help from one and all - doctor (Ali Asgar), tantrik (Ashish Vidyarthi), police (Manav Kaul) and even a top psychiatrist (Mithun Chakraborty) - but all efforts go in vain.Admittedly, the film has its moments and some scenes like the girl sleep walking around the house and later, the chilling interaction with her parents has the vintage RGV touch. But some clumsy writing and a highly unsatisfactory climax kills the film completely. The solution given to cure the possessed girl is in very bad taste and will send a wrong message to the society, particularly the superstitious folks. Wonder how a noted director like RGV could even think of ending his film with such tripe!!Of the cast, Krishna Gautam reminds us of the wonderful Revathi from Raat. Here is an actor to watch out for. Mithun Chakraborty has a small role but leaves a mighty impression. Makarand Deshpande aka Mak is convincing as the hapless paapa. Ashish Vidyarthi overacts in the two scenes he gets. Manav Kaul is earnest as the inspector. And yea, why is the oh so lovely Flora Saini wasted in such an inconsequential role. RGV hasnt utilised her at all. Or has he already planned a sequel which will be entirely based on her character. Well, time will tell!!Regards, Sumeet Nadkarni."

","Granted, I must admit that I was initially expecting this 2020 satirical comedy to be utter rubbish. Why? Well, I mean a movie that portrays - albeit in a funny way - the orange leprechaun that was 4 years the head of state, well that was just not exactly the recipe for something great.Or so I thought...Turns out that writer and director Param Gill actually managed to put together something that was rather fun to watch, and it is actually fun to watch this satirical jabs at the orange man.Eddie Griffin was actually rather enjoyable in this movie, portraying Satan, the man whom orchestrated the rise to power for the orange goofball. While actor Jeff Rector - playing Donald Trump - has some of the mannerisms and speech patterns down for imitating Trump, he just didn't really look the part. That was a bit of a shame, because it would have been more enjoyable if the actor actually looked more like the orange man himself. And as for Kevin Indio Copeland - portraying Vladimir Putin - well that was just a massive swing and a miss, because he looked nothing like Putin.One thing that was missing, was the orange skin tone of Trump, actor Jeff Rector just wasn't smeared enough in orange gunk to make him stand out like the actual clown does."Bad President" proved to be entertaining and enjoyable enough for a single viewing, but that is also about it. The movie just doesn't have the contents to support more than a single viewing.The release date of the movie was just good, as a satirical comedy about the orange man couldn't have come at a more appropriate time.My rating of "Bad President" actually lands on a six out of ten stars. The movie was fun to watch, but it was hardly a comedy gem in the making. Regardless of you being a Trump devotee or not, this movie is something that should be watched, although I am sure that a lot of Trump supporters out there will find offense in a spoof such as this."

It is full of colorful sequences of light that reflect the emotional states of characters. It is unsettling, strange, and disturbing, yet entrancing and radiant. By bending reality, immersing you in low light and moody music, and with flashbacks, the film brings you into a Kafka-like story. There are so many questions left unanswered; a girl diving into water, a woman watching, stabbings, surprising emotional shifts, a girl singing that triggers deep emotions, and so much more.In an introduction to the film the director encourages the audience to keep an open mind.

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10062556/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," Bhuj is a 70s story told in 70s manners with 2020s Visual Effects. It may not become jingoism but certainly becomes a TV serial in the Feature Film. ","Bhuj : The Pride Of India (2021) : Movie Review -It might sound unbelievable but Bhuj : The Pride Of India provides the Maximum amount of war footage any Bollywood movie has ever seen. Take films like Haqeeqat and Border into account for that, and yes Bhuj actually surpasses these two magnum opus. However, the war footage or action sequences does not mean the entire film and Bhuj has failed to understand that. It could be because it had multiple stories to tell at the same while Haqeeqat and Border were just about that one specific war with the needed characters. Bhuj has 4-5 stories involved hence the weightage was too much to carry for a debutant director like Abhishek Dudhaiya who doesn't seem to have came out of TV serial mindset yet.Bhuj the pride of India is a story about 300 Gujarati women who helped the Indian Airforce to build a runway and at same time it also tells one War happening nearby, struggle of Indian Air force and the biggest and last war happened for East Pakistan (Today's Bagladesh). The film is promoted as a story of Bhuj but frankly how much space it provides to that main thing? Hardly 30% if I'm not wrong and then rest 70% cover three other stories. It has those all relatable and true references such as East Pakistan War, Indira Gandhi, Sam Manekshaw, Battle of Longewala (on which 'Border' was made) and all the real characters of this story but it fails to manage that linear equation of storyline. That two days before, four days before, present day, Spy Story, weeks before events etc. All these aren't lined-up property hence the film looks scattered.Performances of all the actors are underwhelming. Ajay Devgn is strictly average, yes i am saying it because his Calibre is damn too high for such great stories but the writer and director both didn't recognise it. Sharad Kelkar and Sanjay Dutt are below average and with those over the fight scenes in the climax, they might just remind you of Rajamouli's 'Magadheera'. Remember that climax, one man fighting against hundred men, the same stuff. Sonakshi Sinha and Nora Fatehi are just there to complete their scenes, no matter how dull it looks, they had to finish their parts with terrible dialogue delivery. That entire cast unit of Pakistan Army/Agency has failed to catch the tone of characters. Not a single actor talks like a Pakistani, i mean how bad their dialogue delivery was.Bhuj is an over-explosive film for such a narrow minded writing. Like i said, it provides maximum amount of war footage but it is completely clueless about where to put them. The first 15 minutes and you'll be like, Wow, Bhuj looks terrific because it starts off right with high-octane explosions and sky-take scenes. But it's not that smooth later as it drags consistently after every 15 minutes in its unskillful storytelling. Director is at fault here and nobody else. Thankfully it's a pacy film not boring at all. Bhuj was a grand story which deserved to be told in grand manners and skillful vision and Dudhaiya lacks both. He has made half the film in feature film aspects and half in daily-soap materials. Maybe someone like Om Raut could have given it a proper justice like he did to Tanhaji despite a smaller story than this Anyways, overall it's strictly average stuff but yes TV audience may find it interesting as they can digest anything for the sake drama and entertainment.RATING - 5/10*"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10062556/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," Only for action lovers. ","The ratings are kinda surprising to me, as this film worked on the entertainment front and delivered popcorn thrills. Bhuj: The Pride of India is not among the films that are driven entirely by dialogue or some deep character drama but by the action sequences and tension instead. This results in a full action-packed spectacle with set pieces delivered nonstop and the pacing, fast from start to finish.Even though one song sequence early on might take you out of the "true story" experience, it regains itself quickly and delivers an explosive action blockbuster, which is how I think most viewers should perceive before seeing the film. It will definitely satisfy hardcore action buffs, especially those who like Michael Bay-esque explosions every few minutes. Others expecting a deep character-driven war drama might receive disappointment instead.Speaking of the performances, the actors do a splendid job for the major part. The editing I felt was neat since the constant focus on the action/battle scenes did not allow any sort of tedium to enter anywhere during the nearly 2-hour long running time. Also, it was positively surprising to see all credits/text in both English and Hindi, which is quiet new for Bollywood in ways more than one.That being said, Bhuj: The Pride of India is nothing more than an engaging popcorn action flick. Watch it if you love the genre and just want to have a good time without thinking too much. Those, on the other hand, expecting some complex storytelling can check out something else. This one's for escapists."

","Story: The story portrays the Bhuj account of the war between India and Pakistan during 1971.Cinematography: Justified. Cinema has got the quality that comes along with brand name of Devgan. Helicopters, Planes, Bunkers, ammo, soldiers, villages etc are well defined.Direction: The direction appears as if the director wants to give a total account rather than an engaging one. You will get to know what happened but there will be no life.Acting (& music): Below average. Neither acting works well, neither the dialogs, nor the songs.Final Verdict: We have come across many movies on 1971 war. The good thing with this movie is it provides a total account.An additional point for Ajay Devgan to show courage to trust OTT. I welcome his decision. An indirect way to keep people safe."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10062556/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","3"," A wasted opportunity!! ","Bhuj : The Pride of India review :During the 1971 war, Pakistani air forces had destroyed the Indian force airstrip at Bhuj which led to its airport in charge Squadron Leader Vijay Karnik to seek the help of three hundred local woman from the nearby village to reconstruct the airstrip in record time so as to prevent the enemy from assuming control over the Western part of India. This heroic as well as interesting deed deserved a cinematic interpretation, no doubt. Unfortunately, Bhuj doesnt do any justice to it.The film is so badly scripted and edited that trust me, for the first twenty minutes or so, it is difficult to comprehend what exactly is going on. Narrated in a non -linear timeline, we are introduced to Ajay Devgn as Vijay Karnik in a rather tame entry before cutting to Sanjay Dutt who is an informer cum spy called Pagi helping out the Indian Army batallion led by a braveheart (Sharad Kelkar). Somewhere in all this, a Pakistani General dreams of having tea with Indira Gandhi while jasoos Nora Fatehi (yup, the item girl!!) is in Pakistan trying to uncover their devious plan to attack India. When her lid gets blown, she starts chanting some Islamic verses before being publicly stoned to death.So far so confused!! But what about the three hundred womenfolk you may ask; isn't the story all about them - their act of valour and love for the motherland? Well, the actual brave act by these women is accorded just ten to fifteen minutes of runtime in the movie. Worse, the manner in which they are shown doing the construction work is so haphazard that our local Municipality would do better..Of the cast, none are able to leave a mark as the screenplay simply fails them. Devgn doesn't get any taali maar moments while Sanjay Dutt looks totally unconvincing killing a thousand enemy soldiers with a small axe. The technical aspects are just as poor particularly the VFX which turn crucial scenes like the aerial attack and the climactic landing of our Indian force aircraft in to a videogame like farce.Bhuj is nothing but a wasted opportunity. There was a great story to tell here but the filmmakers blew it up completely. This is a film which wont benefit the careers of any of its cast and crew. Except probably Nora Fatehi who finally makes the transition from an item girl to a respectable role.Regards, Sumeet Nadkarni."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10062556/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," Poor Direction And Bad Screenplay ","Review By Kamal KThe movie begins on an interesting note with a brief introduction of the geopolitical backdrop. It helps one understand the basic situation even if one is not cued in with the history. However, soon things began to get complicated with the introduction of multiple characters and their tracks. The screenplay further doesn't let one get hold of things. It creates a messy feel.The entire first hour acts as a set-up to the key block that happens post-intermission. It is this sequence that offers some engaging moments. But, even they are not executed well to give a sense of wow. They are passable at best.The climax is the final nail in the coffin of frustration. We know there is an arresting sequence to have, but what we get is distracted output due to immensely tacky and amateurish execution.When the main actor (Ajay Devgn) itself gets a sketchy part there is very little hope from the rest. Sharad Kelkar and Sanjay Dutt do their bits but it comes a little too late in the day. The impact is missing. Still, the latter is better, among the two. Ammy Virk, in comparison, has a better deal even though it's a short role. Noora Fatehi tries hard, but all her efforts go in vain due to the messy narrative.Drawbacks -ScreenplayEditingWritingDirection."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10062556/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt"," Sometimes the sum of its parts is greater than a whole ","What worked: One of the very few things that I liked was the real footage that comes at the start regarding the war. Maybe some of Ajay's shots were done fine.What did not work: I think almost all the aspects of the movie was very poorly done, starting with the direction and dialogues. One of the introspection that makers today need to realize is that the movie goers are more receptive and enjoyed the access of all the means from around the world. So , the movie with a theme of patriotism wrapped with unrealistic dialogues and weak screenplay is the thing of the past and not any more. With contemporary movies like Uri and Shershaah with limited budget than this movie have done fine job, even taking the Indian movie culture. One of the biggest issue is the screenplay which lacked depth of characters and dialogues that made it worse; it's more heroic than an authentic characters. As a result ,performances were flat and unappealing. A lot is wrong with the movie, the vibe, the mood and the climate feels so off from the start that we come to see that the whole project could have been much better considering the resources they have to make a decent movie if not a great one.Final verdict: watch it to learn what not to do in a movie project."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10062556/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," A major milestone of defending India's borders, the film squandered its opportunity of being a classic ",""Bhuj" is about the Pakistani attack on India's western border in 1971, a part of a planned incursion to annexe the western states of Rajasthan & Gujarat in retaliation to India's support of East Pakistan's revolt against the ruling Pakistani government. While India was busy helping the "Muktijoddhas" get their independence to form Bangladesh, Gen. Yahya Khan decided to take India unawares by attacking the west to get to the negotiation table with Smt. Indira Gandhi in Delhi. Bhuj and the Rann of Kutch bore the brunt of these attacks and tested the Indian Armed Forces' resilience. The Bhuj airbase was badly damaged as the attacks were initiated and was vulnerable as a front due to the heavy casualties it had suffered, but thanks to the timely reinforcement by additional forces sent from Delhi, the Pakistani designs of annexation were thwarted."Bhuj" is indeed a milestone for defence by the Induan armed forces and is content-rich. It is well researched, edge of the seat and educative as a narrative. But it has a lot to tell - about Bhuj, Rann of Kutch, Delhi, East Pakistan / Bangladesh and Islamabad. Since it tries to cover many aspects, it loses its objective and meanders off in many directions. It spends too much time in promoting the anti-Pakistan propaganda by giving much airtime to the enemy's ploys, rhetoric and execution of its plan. It also employs far too many characters in the film to showcase the Indian patriotism and resorts to heroics and dramatics. Due to the innumerable characters in the film, none gets the depth or breadth of emotional appeal, leaving them one-dimensional and without any interconnect. The VFX is downright tacky, especially in the beginning, making a poor visual impact.Ajay Devgn has the largest role but doesn't allow the character of Squadron Leader Vijay Karnik to grow into someone of substance. Ditto for Sharad Kelkar and Sanjay Dutt - the depth of their emotional aspect goes missing altogether. Sonakshi Sinha gets a song and dance apart from leading the team of women and men who mend the damaged runway overnight - I only wish that her role could have been more realistic and less dramatic. Pranitha gets to do precious little as Ajay Devgn's wife. The only person who makes a strong impact is Ammy Virk who gives a sombre and no-nonsense performance. Nora Fatehi gets a meaningful and fierce role and does justice. "Bhuj" had the potential of being classified in the category of Border, LOC Kargil and the likes directed by J P Dutta, but the first independent venture for director Abhishek Dudhaiya fails to bind the story into a well-knit, focused and interesting execution."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10062556/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","1"," Why does this film have such high ratings? ","Yes 5.1 is insanely high for this ginormous piece of sh!t film. At first, judging from the reviews I thought it won't be that bad. But I was completely wrong. It is absolutely sh^t. The only thing it can be compared to is a pile of sh;t. Nothing else at all.The makers have done such extreme disservice to this riveting tale of valour and bravery. They've made a complete joke of the story. This film doesn't inspire you at all. Not one bit. It's filled with such pathetic scenes, cringe scenes, shady dialogues, that you won't feel inspired even one bit. Even when they hoist the Indian flag and a monologue goes on in the background, you will only be happy that it's over and won't feel even .00001% emotional.The director is an absolute lame duck who has absolutely no clue how to make a film. I am not exaggerating even the slightest in saying the following. It feels like a TV serial and you will feel like you are watching some Balveer crap that they show these days on television. The BGM is of the worst quality possible and doesn't do anything to make things intense. I can just go on listing the things that I found horrible in this film. But I will struggle to list one thing good in it. There are literally no redeeming qualities. Even the acting is piss poor. Ajay Devgn has a straight face throughout and his dialogue delivery will give you nightmares. He's a bad and overrated as hl actor and this film puts his acting skills in the limelight. I did not even like him in Tanhaji and he's just the same here. So hope people will realise the truth about his acting abilities.The editors of this film have directed this film being high on Vimal paan masala it seems like. The pacing is extremely terrible. Any random scene will suddenly show up and you won't comprehend why did the previous scene cut so quick. This happens constantly and it seriously gets on your nerves. The editors have a big role to play in this films absolute failure to inspire apart from the director who thought he is making a Hindi soap opera.Yes the VFX is of low quality, but that's not what makes this film not worth your time and subscription. It's the absolute travesty of film making, a complete disgrace to movies in general and a full on mockery being made of a wonderful true story that should keep you away from this movie. I'm just glad that it didn't release in theatres and no viewers money is going to waste. Yes their time is wasted, but it's still better than paying the makers to watch something like this.It won't be wrong to say that this maybe the worst film you have or will have ever watched in your life, because very honestly, it's super super bad. Please don't waste your time with this one.I give it 0.5/10 and feel that it's currently rated very highly."

","The harrowing real-life tale of the bravehearts of the Bhuj Airbase in Western India rebuilding an entire airfield in hours to counter the Pakistanis in the War of 1971 deserved a better film.Ajay Devgn's 'Bhuj' is not just a shambolic retelling of the iconic incident but it oversimplifies and makes almost every element so contrived that it is rendered unwatchable.Nora Fatehi as an Indian spy is a major eyesore while Sanjay Dutt as a real-life Indian army scout Ranchhod Pagi is so over-the-top and outlandish that it seems director Abhishek Dudhaiya thought that the film is getting a 1990s release.A fight sequence where Dutt's character takes down 100-150 Pakistani soldiers with just a battle axe, a full blown prayer song during a tense battle and Sonakshi cutting down a leopard while nursing a baby are some of the Rajnikanth-esque level nonsense the makers have filled this film with.An iconic act of heroism from Squadron Leader Vijay Karnik and his men of the Bhuj airbase that deserved so much better. Given that Prime released the far superior 'Shershaah' during the same Independence day weekend means Bhuj doesnt even deserve a rushed viewing.Not recommended."

Afterall, theres Ajay Devgn, Sanjay Dutt and what not.O man, horrible is even better. This one came out like a D grade movie with all the hotch potch, no proper acting, any flow, and above all, superfluous emotions that held no point. Oh, i forgot songs, disgrace to a war movie. And let me tell you, there are tons of those situations when i either felt angry or atrociously angry.While in movies like Border, i felt sad and got into emotions when a lead actor died in action and turned martyr. In here, leave aside sadness, there came out no feelings.Dont, and i repeat again, don't watch this crap."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10062556/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," An Incredible True Story Of Unsung Valour Gets A Hyper Nationalistic Tribute !!! ","On the night of December 8, PAF (Pakistan Air Force) jets dropped more than 14 Napalm bombs on the Indian Air Force airstrip in Bhuj. The impact rendered the airstrip useless and the Indian combat aircrafts dysfunctional. The IAF expected the Border Security Force (BSF) to restore the airstrip but time was ticking, and labour was scarce. It was during this time that 300 villagers-mostly women-from Madhapur in Bhuj, decided to step in to defend the country by repairing the damaged airbase within 72 hours. In Bhuj: The Pride of India, director Abhishek Dudhaiya remembers these unsung warriors and the story of their incredible bravery, that deserves to be told. Credit to Ajay Devgn for bringing this act of valour to screen.The India-Pakistan war of 1971 ensued during the Bangladesh liberation war in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh). As India aided East Pakistan to end West Pakistan's (now Pakistan) oppressive regime on it, PAK attacked western regions of India hoping to use it as a bargaining tool to trade against the captured territories in the east. Various Indian air bases were bombed as part of the strategy. The Bhuj airbase was one of the prominent IAF (Indian Air Force) territory that took a massive hit.During 1971's Indo-Pak war, 300 Bhuj women risked their lives to restore the bombed Indian Air Force airstrip in Bhuj, so that it stays operational to defend the incoming Pak air and land assault. Encouraging the local women to help repair the airstrip on a war footing was Squadron leader Vijay Karnik (Ajay Devgn). The film recalls the crisis and the contribution of the courageous civilians and the Indian Armed Forces.Ajay Devgn was super-duper brilliant in his role of Squadron Leader Vijay Karnik. Sanjay Dutt, Sharad Kelkar & Sonakshi Sinha was very good in their respective roles.Bhuj's makers make it clear right in the disclaimer that this film is a work of fiction inspired by true events. This explains its dramatic approach to retelling history. The film often forgoes the nuances to play to the gallery. Though made in contemporary times, Dudhaiya's expression is more true to the 90s school of thought, where everything is literally spelt out. In reality, it was reported that the Bhuj women had to wear green and cow dung was used on the strip to camouflage it from the PAF planes. One can overlook the drama, but in a premise such as this, trading off logic at the cost of dramatisation, seems hard to digest. The writing could have been more mindful.The first half is scattered with various characters in cameos giving brave speeches without a context. The depiction of events leading upto the attack on Bhuj airbase are disorderly. The film however, redeems itself in the second half as that's where the real action and drama unfold. Thereon, it's a gripping thriller that keeps you invested. From 120 soldiers guarding the Vighakot post and defending the country to witnessing a plane rest its front on a truck for landing - the action game, (realistic and unrealistic) is on point. Even the aerial combat scenes keep you invested.The sound and visuals are made for the big screen. While the VFX is strictly passable, the sound is competent enough to transport you to the battlefield. Ajay Devgn's template slowmo shots are plenty and he gets the intensity of his character right. Sanjay Dutt, Sonakshi Sinha, Sharad Kelkar and Ammy Virk are decent as well. Among the cameos, casting Navni Parihar as former PM Indira Gandhi works well."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10062556/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," Good story, pathetic editing! ","I have been generous in giving a 5 just because of the effort to want to make a movie on the 1971 Bhuj events. Ajay Devgan productions make C grade, way below average movies and this one totally wastes the opportunity to convert a wonderful story into a motion picture. Ajay Devgun should stop producing movies. This one is a disjointed movie where scenes suddenly arrive and in the next frame/s something totally unrelated or irrelevant is happening. The worst editing seen in a long time in a Hindi movie. The first 15 minutes are exciting and set the tone for the movie but from there it's all downhill until the end. There are scenes which are not even completely filmed and go incomplete or just haywire where the viewer feels helpless. Even after the movie finishes, the end credits are shocking with repeated real life pics of the Marathi Captain(he was brave no doubt in real life!) who Ajay plays, but real life pics of the Air force Sikh captain who played a big role in the events are missing altogether etc etc. Shameful production!!"

The script itself lacks focus and the film seems to be a collection of various war scenes hastily joined together. There is a strong desire of the film to show Ajay Devgn as "Singham" rather than the hassled commanding officer of an Air force base under attack during war. The bomb explosions and the falling aeroplanes visuals have been overdone.The basic human interest story of 300 village women repairing a damaged runway at risk to their lives is put in the back burner by the director and is dealt with clumsily towards the end. And why the huge drums and singing at a critical moment when only a few hours were available to repair the runway ? It looked ridiculous. The jingoism is OK but did the squadron leader really have to be shown operating the guns, and driving trucks and roadrollers? Too much playing to the gallery I guess which has lowered the believability of the film. And why was the sardarji pilot shown so depressed and lacking enthusiasm? Even his boss thought so."

In short, this is one of those moments I could not believe is realistic in anyway.BHUJ probably has the most mass masala entertainer style which was meant only for the theatres for the masses (not classes) to see . Over the top dialogue-baazi is something that brings down this film but i get it, it is a mass entertainer so it had to be there.Plot is definitely interesting and so is the screenplay, which quite engages you till the end. Since the film is not that long, it is fast paced and is not boring at least. They have also tried their hand at aerial action sequences which is a good attempt , I appreciated their efforts (any new effort made by Bollywood should be encouraged only then will they try improve it) .Now coming to the major issues - the VFX. Super bad! A grand scale film like this needed good VFX and BHUJ fails here miserably. Still in some places the VFX looked good but the majority of it had fake looking blasts and cartoonish bombs flying around which kind of puts off your mood. Had they got the VFX right, this film would have still been a good watch. (PS - even BORDER had better VFX than this)Second issue is the characters. In such a short duration, the film tries to focus more on the proceedings and action rather than character development. None of the characters leave any emotional impact on you. Even a Sharad Kelkar when he dies doesn't bring any tears in your eyes. Sonakshi has nothing much to do at all. Sanju Baba is good and so is Ajay but he is in his Tanhaji mode still. Pranitha, lol she had a better role in HUNGAMA 2 atleast. Nora Fatehi, same case, no emotional connect.THIS IS WHERE A 3HR LONG FILM COMES HANDY! THIS IS WHY FILMS LIKE BORDER SUCCEEDED.Overall, just a one time watch. I found it quite interesting but needed a much much much better treatment."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10069166/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","1"," 10?! Uhm?!.... ","I rarely give such low ratings to movies but I had to say something this time because this IMDb rating, really feels like someone went to a lot of trouble to rig the reviews here. I love independent cinema, I collect Blu-ray's from indie movies but this is one that I won't be watching again for sure.The high reviews here in IMDb feel totally out of place and unreal.Usually it's me on the other side giving great reviews to indie movies that people seem to hate on IMDb. Not this time. This time I totally agree with the bad reviews and I cannot get over the feel that all the excellent opinions were planted by the filmmakers and family or friends. And only them.I love this type of twilight zone story, indie supernatural stories set in small towns tend to work well but not this time.The story on this one is so predictable that I immediately though this was going to be some copy of the classic twilight zone story, The hitchhiker because the concept was evident from the get go. So zero mystery, zero suspense and nothing will amaze you at the end because the new age type spiritual message is so thrown down our throats that it totally ruins the good idea this story obviously had when it comes to the mystery of the lights.The pacing on this movie is really off. Many times it seems takes are left running forever adding unnecessary seconds to many of the scenes making everything extend artificially as if the filmmakers really needed to hit 95 minutes but had no content to go beyond 45. At first I thought the movie was trying to be artsy but soon became evident that was just terrible editing. Perhaps because there was no material to be filmed.Something that worked against the actors too as there are plenty of terrible performances in this that could be avoided with good editing to trim the unnecessary forced moments in many of the lines.The pace in dialogues is so off that it's clear when an actor is just waiting for the other to stop speaking to be able to deliver his line next and that totally ruins the flow of the story.It's a weird mix with the acting, it's as if they just picked people from the street and filmed stuff just because.Some dialogues are actually funny in a good way but then the amateur delivery almost ruins them completely. The hitchiker and the waitress are really good but then other actors are so bad that they ruin everything. Although I bet much is to blame on the director too. This is really a weird movie. There's some weird twin peaks vibe to it as if this is trying to be some David lynch movie but nothing works.The movie has a cool soundtrack but once again there are so many songs in this stuff that many times I was wondering if the movie was just made to showcase some cool indie bands material and not to tell the story, because even the songs tend to stall time because there's plenty of sequences in this where the story actually stops to give room for the songs to be played to illustrate pointless narrative points.So overall is this a terrible indie movie? It's bad but it's not terrible although I felt that it's necessary to pull this rating down a bit to realistic levels as I'm sure there will be plenty of people which will be fooled by the unreal 8, 9, 10 ratings. At best this deserves a 3 for the effort but that's it.It's the first time I say this about a movie on IMDb but it really feels like the excellent reviews were just planted here by the filmmakers, family and friends. Don't be fooled."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10069166/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","1"," Created an Account Just To Rate This ","The IMDB reviews for this one are so odd - so... suspiciously positive.I watch a lot of movies... A lot. Mostly horror, thriller... The indies and the unknowns, too. Covid has sharted out a lot of bad stuff over the last year and a half while major studios held back a lot of their premiere titles; so I got very familiar with looking for lower-budget gems during that time... You can imagine how much trash I've watched and sat through.With that in mind, know that I created an account here at IMDB just to post a review of this particular movie so I could at least tailor a realistic representation that'll sit alongside the suspiciously fake looking glowing reviews and laughably high rating for a movie this bad...The movie is cheap. Like art-house cheap. I laughed out loud at the very first scene in the movie - which looked like it was filmed in a basement with red flashlights... so I can't say I didn't see what was coming.The premise is ok and Tony Todd is a plus; but besides him none of the characters are relatable or likeable. The acting is mediocre at best (though I do like Tony it's not his best work either).The movie goes nowhere. It slides in and out of coherence and becomes nearly nonsensical by the time you're 3/4 into it... and by then you're praying for the credits and wishing you'd picked a better movie to watch while at the same time wondering how you got 3/4 the way into a movie this bad.After it ended I reflected on the fact that some very suspect-looking user reviews on this site definitely contributed to my watching this movie - there are numerous 10/10 reviews...in reality - Was it bad enough to actually create an IMDb account to pan this movie?Would appear so."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10077034/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," What a Twist!

A. Slasher, Let's Be Evil and Killers Anonymous. It has the feel of Kingsmen or Now You See Me and if you liked those movies, you'll like this. If you're a stickler for the classics, you surely will not.Raff Law is, of course, the son of Jude Law and this is a nice way to introduce him to audiences.

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10077034/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","3"," Twisting on & Turning off Charles Dickens ","A perennial favorite with film producers, Charles Dickens' second classic novel "Oliver Twist," published back in 1838, serves as the source material for director Martin Owen's "Twist," and it is advertised as "a modern take on the classic tale." If you're counting, "Twist" is the 18th adaptation of Dickens' timeless tome. "Twist" raises the protagonist's age so he is a teen now, and the story takes place in contemporary London. Although he spent two months polishing his parkour skills, Jude Law's lookalike son Raff said a seasoned stunt man stood in for him on the more audacious antics. You'll know for sure when it isn't Raff because you won't see his face when he does it. Meantime, the parkour acrobats certainly earned their pay doubling for him. Similarly, all the juveniles in the beloved narrative are older, and Fagin (two-time Oscar winner Michael Caine of "Hannah and Her Sisters" and "The Cider House Rules") musters them as his arms and legs for his shady shenanigans. "Killers Anonymous" director Martin Owen and scenarists Sally Collett of "Max Cloud" and John Wrathall of "The Liability" have given both the Bill Sikes and Artful Dodger characters a gender makeover, so they are now ladies. "Game of Thrones" actress Lena Headey plays Sikes as a psychotic lesbian with an itchy trigger finger, while "Fifty Shades of Grey" actress Rita Ora is cast as Dodge. Nevertheless, this gender-swapping feat doesn't distinguish "Twist." Incidentally, "Twist" isn't the first time this yarn has been updated. The Disney animated musical "Oliver & Company" (1988) was set in contemporary New York City. Moreover, some characters were turned into animals! For example, Oliver Twist was a stray kitten, while The Artful Dodger was a dog.Oliver Twist (newcomer Raff Law) never met his father, but his mother spoiled him. Molly Twist (Sally Collett) taught her son to appreciate good art. She took him to the National Gallery, and they drew pictures on their sketch pads about dream vacations in exotic settings. Tragically, Molly died from unknown causes, leaving her juvenile son to fend for himself. Refusing to be institutionalized, Oliver vanishes without a trace in London, only to emerge years later as a gifted graffiti artist. Dangling perilously from skyscrapers, Oliver prefers to spray paint epic pictures that people from afar can see. One day while he is eluding an angry London Traffic Warden (Leigh Francis), Oliver catches the attention of Dodge (singer-songwriter Rita Ora) and Batesy (Franz Drameh of "Hereafter") who help him out after he loses his pants during his flight from the police. They take him to meet Fagin (Michael Caine), an avuncular crime lord who provides bed and board for wayward youth who do his bidding. Mind you, "Twist" is a far echo from the army of pickpockets that Fagin mobilized throughout Victorian London in the Dickens' novel. Eventually, Oliver abandons his lone wolf solitude when Fagin dispatches Red (Sophie Simnett of "Acres and Acres") to invite him to one of their home cooked family meals. Not surprisingly, since he is infatuated with Red, Oliver joins Fagin's family of thieves without a second thought. Specifically, he replaces Tom Chitling (newcomer Dominic Di Tommaso), an unfortunate soul who died mysteriously after a rooftop foot chase over the film's opening credits. Once an art dealer, Fagin masterminds a plot to expose a high-profile art dealer, Dr. Crispin Losberne (David Walliams of "Stardust"), for the infamous criminal that he is. This requires stealing a rare, 18th century Hogarth painting from an auction house in broad daylight.Sadly, "Twist" amounts to little more than a small potatoes, by-the-numbers art heist, with the treacherous Sikes out to double cross Fagin and shoot Twist. Sikes is particularly angry with Twist because her girlfriend Red is smitten by his charm. Surprisingly, Owen and company don't devote more time to the Twist & Red romance. Meantime, none of the thinly drawn characters stand out in this inferior crime thriller. The most exciting scene occurs before the art heist when our heroes steal the villain's cell phone, clone it, and then scramble to return it before he realizes his loss. The barebones Owen, Collett, and Wrathall screenplay boasts little ingenuity, and the suspense generates few thrills. The cliffhanger confrontation scene near the end, with Twist clinging by his fingertips to the edge of a building, doesn't drum up any fear about our hero's ability to survive. The only character that stands out in "Twist" is Lena Headey's trigger-happy, homicidal Sikes. The highlight of the action is her fracas with London police who outnumber her four to one. Not even Michael Caine's venerable presence can redeem this predictable second-rate pabulum. "Twist" has neither enough intrigue nor romance to turn on anybody."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10077034/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," Dickens' name in vain ","Greetings again from the darkness. This is billed as "a modern take on the classic tale of Oliver Twist". The problem with that is this feels neither modern, nor in line with the renowned Charles Dickins novel. Mostly it feels like a failed attempt at copying Guy Ritchie's SNATCH, or the KINGSMAN movies, or even the NOW YOU SEE ME movies. Directed by Martin Owen with a script by John Wrathall, Sally Collett and six other credited contributing writers (in addition to the inspiration from Dickens), this film simply lacks the entertainment value necessary for any type of positive recommendation. So I won't be writing much here, only addressing what we see on screen.Raff Law (Jude Law's son) nabbed his first starring role as Twist, a street artist living on his own. One day he stumbles into Dodge (Rita Ora), Batesy (Franz Drameh), and Red (Sophie Simnett) who introduce him to Fagin (two-time Oscar winner Michael Caine), who presides over this group of criminal misfits. The offer of free clothes, decent housing, a team to work with, and a possible romance, is enough to entice Twist out of his rooftop tent.This is really a simple art heist movie with multiple scenes of parkour included in place of real danger or creative thrills. David Walliams plays the target, and as a bonus, ripping him off would settle an old score for Fagin, and the over-the-top psychopath Sikes (Lena Headey). Somehow out of step in a movie with no real step is a recurring gag featuring a traffic cop played by Leigh Warden. It's unclear if this was held over from an early slapstick version of the film, or if it was intended to portray Twist as an outlaw.Noel Clark maintains his dignity as Detective Brownlow, and Ms. Headey attempts to liven things up, but mostly the characters are forgettable due to an all too simple story and a lack of development. The annoying music doesn't help, and neither does the lack of any insightful social commentary (a Dickens specialty). It seems obvious the filmmakers were trying to create something edgy and modern, and go so far as to open with a jab at Carol Reed's 1968 musical OLIVER!, by having narrator Twist state there will be "No singing. No dancing. And no happy ending." If a filmmaker risks re-making or re-imagining a classic story, they must be ready for the comparisons. This one falls well short of that 1968 version, as well as David Lean's 1948 OLIVER TWIST, with Alec Guinness as Fagin.In theaters and On Demand starting July 30, 2021."

But will Fagin be successful?I can't deny that Twist is sprightly and energetic and I can't really fault the cast who have clearly put a lot of effort in to trying to make this work, but the truth is that overall it doesn't...If you take away the snazzy editing and the flashy 'parkour' scenes Twist does reveal itself to be somewhat empty. The heist itself is fairly dull and workmanlike and even the build up and planning involved feels a bit formulaic; there isn't much in the way of surprises and anyone who has seen the Real Hustle or pretty much any heist film will likely be able to predict the turn of events before they happen.As I've mentioned the cast try their best, but they're quite superficially developed with precious backstory so there's not much they can do tbh. However, Lena Headey's psychotic turn as Sikes was the best of the lot (then again years of playing horrid Cersei Lannister in Game of Thrones has probably made such a performance come quite naturally). Weak links in the cast lie with Leigh Francis rather pointless cameo and a poor performance from David Walliams in a role which I felt anyone could play.In summary then it's flashy, snappily edited and its numerous 'parkour scenes' give it some energy, but at the same time it feels hollow and quite dull if you strip the whole thing bare."

I found it to be a chore to sit though.I don't want to be horrible but the acting was absolutely awful. It was so lifeless and just really bad. Every single actor was bad.Also a warning that most of this film is just running sequences that normally end up on rooftops. I'm pretty sure that some parts were shot on a go pro.It also had this like sugary sweetness undertone which clashed so much with the "English crime" tone. It was like a kids movie but about a gang in London?It was really bad."

The casting crew should have realised that a pop star doesn't necessarily make a good film as it's shows that Rita Ora plays herself but with an accentuated accent, hopeless and very unconvincingly. She should stick to music, acting is not her forte.If this what rubbish sky invests its money in they should sack everyone who decided to spend any money on this awful film."

Not only can't Rita Ora act she can't run either, that was best bit of movie. The lad in glasses and red haired girl were pretty good but the male lead was possibly the worst actor I've ever seen, he is awful, for his first lead role he should feel humiliated, his delivery, mannerisms and screen presence were worse than David Williams.Cheap, cheesy, rip off of films from snatch to oceans franchise, obviously had to throw in pointless gay story to, Caine looked too ill to act, there was nothing good, stop making films SKU and just go back to ripping off customers"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10077034/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," Not as bad as people are making it out to be. ","I will start out by saying that I completely agree, this film clearly struggles with finding an audience and is clearly confused with who it's meant to appeal to. The violence it's "watered down/cartoonish" enough for a PG rating but with all the swearing (frequent uses of the four letter words including an F bomb) it wouldn't get a PG rating in the US. Another thing I found strange was the soundtrack which kept jumping between modern day hip hop and 90s-00s britpop, which further raised the question...Who is this film meant to appeal to?I would in no way call this movie terrible as many of the reviews suggest. It's your standard paint by numbers art caper set to the story of Oliver Twist with a ridiculous amount of parkour added in. Parts of the movie are fun but nothing is really original, it feels like the type of movie you could watch on TV and not feel like you wasted your time. That's the level of entertainment I received from it at least..."

Quite possibly this is his worst film ever, I am struggling to think of any other of his films which matched this in pure desperation. I am assuming he did it for the cash and not the script as that painful to watch too. I don't think it's his fault but the script is so bad even the best of actors could make it work.I have to be honest, I didn't get to the end of the film, I don't think there is any chances I will. Do yourself a favour and skip past this abomination of a film."

How can you hope that they get away with stealing a painting, when one of the gang kills a policewoman, and the rest of the gang knows this and they still follow. If we are supposed to have sympathy for the characters, well i don't. They all should be locked up.The main character is poor living off the streets, does not steal, yet is able to buy expensive paints to do his graffiti. There is a scene where the Twist is in a swimming pool with Nancy in the middle of the night. They run away and in the next minute they are dry as a bone, because we all know London nights are very hot.If this is supposed to be a feel good movie....it is....when it finished I felt good."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10078904/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","1"," Oh this was bad... ","Right, well as I sat down to watch the 2021 movie titled "Jaws of Los Angeles" (aka "Apex Predators"), I must admit that I didn't really harbor much of any high hopes or expectations for the movie. But still, with it being a shark movie that I hadn't already seen before, and on the snowballs chance in Hell of it being a great shark movie, of course I sat down to watch "Jaws of Los Angeles".And this movie was atrociously bad. Seriously, I mean this is one of the worst shark movies I have suffered through, and I had been through a lot of shark movies. What made "Jaws of Los Angeles" fail was the writing from writer and director Dustin Ferguson.Not at a single moment throughout the course of this movie, which made a lot of use of stock footage of sharks, did I ever feel that the danger of actual shark attacks was present. And it didn't really help much that the actors and actresses in the movie were putting on what could best be classified as dubious and questionable performances all round.As for the cast in "Jaws of Los Angeles", well... Let's just say that the managed to get together an ensemble of actors and actresses, sure. But let's not go ahead and say that these were top notch performers. In fact, the vast majority of performances in the entire movie were downright abysmal to look at. If you do enjoy watching questionable plastic surgery results, then consider yourself in for a treat as you sit down to watch "Jaws of Los Angeles"."Jaws of Los Angeles" was frightfully devoid of sharks, well aside from stock footage that didn't have any feel of menacing or danger to it. The movie makers didn't even bother to make a prop for close-up shots of shark attacks.If you enjoy shark movies, just like I do, then do yourself a favor and stay well clear of the 2021 movie "Jaws of Los Angeles". I am rating this train wreck of a movie a generous one out of ten stars. This movie simply wasn't worth the time, money or effort.Actually I will go as far as to say that the movie's cover/poster is actually the best thing about the entire ordeal. And that is just a sad fact."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10078904/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," Underwhelming cheesy shark film ","Following a series of gruesome accidents, the sheriff of a small beach town comes to find the attacks here have been caused by a vicious strain of mutated sharks attacking anything in the waters and sets out with the determined son of a local land-owner trying to open a new resort to stop the bloodthirsty creatures.This was a somewhat underwhelming goofy genre effort. One of the better elements present here is the first half which sets up the inner goings-on while featuring the shark attacking the outskirts of their lives. The idea of this one doing a deep dive into the lives of the residents here, from the land-owners' son trying to keep his personal life together as his ex-girlfriend keeps trying to interfere in his new romance, a developer trying to get a project off the ground, and a detective looking to investigate the origin of the shark attacks with the help of a marine biologist to try to track it down based on the creatures' habits serve this one merely to give an idea of what's going on with the residents throughout here. As well, there's also a lot to like here once this moves past the setup into the generally goofy and enjoyable nature of the shark attacks. These are initially kept to brief moments of the unseen shark ambushing victims where they're out in the water like the diver attack or the ambush on the models' photoshoot. That it pulls off the scene of it attacking a hunters' boat without showing the creature itself is quite a feat as the action features the shark taking out the hunters is a fun enough concept, and the crazy finale features some fun scenes of their plan to stop the creatures that are quite enjoyable. Along with the generally over-the-top revelation that comes about in the closing minutes, this manages to get quite a lot to like about it. This one does have some troublesome aspects. The main drawback on display here is the general lack of shark action throughout the film. With the shark itself being shown as a brief glimpse in one sequence until the finale and relying on stock footage until that point, the film can very easily be forgiven for not being a shark film with the focus on the personal issues going on instead. Carrying out endless scenes of padding as characters walk around the city trying to figure out how to stop the creatures is also a major factor here as these scenes go on forever is also a part of the hold-up to keeping the film from letting loose on the shark action as it should. As well, there's also the film's tendency to become obvious about its low-budget origins, not just with the aforementioned padding and lack of shark action but the whole affairs come of decidedly like this was done quickly and illegally which is all to be expected here.Rated Unrated/R: Graphic Language, Brief Nudity and Violence."

They get up, and go to talk to the father.As conversation starts,, they realize that they know nothing about shooting movies (besides that one class they took in community college), finding locations or talent.. but since the dad is a divorcee, and is trying to be nice to the idiot kid of his, he gives them a few thousand dollars.The "investment" is enough only for the consumer level underwater camera kit and snacks.Writing, filming, editing all is done by these two morons.. because they wasted money on snacks.Talent scouting is also done by them, and their buddy - the amateur adult movie producer - lends help for close ups.TL;DR: the movie is terrible, filming is horrible, editing and script are abhorent. I didn't think acting can be THIS bad.. but here we are.If you're dead set on wasting 75 minutes of your life, stare at the ceiling, pour water into a bottomless bucket, talk to your wall.. those 75 minutes are still going to be more productive."
