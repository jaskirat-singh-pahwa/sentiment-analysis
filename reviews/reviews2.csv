From the brilliant mind of an amazing up-and-coming director, Giving Birth to a Butterfly consistently amazes in a visual and visceral way. Theodore "Ted" Schaefer and Patrick Lawler bring their dark and ominous vision to life: Diana, whose identity has been stolen, bonds with her son's pregnant girlfriend as they travel on a surreal journey to track down the thieves. Annie Parisse is captivating as Diana, while The Mist's Gus Birney plays a delightful turn as Marlene. The always welcome Judith Roberts is sensational as the adrift Nina, and Cesar J. Rosado delivers as Chef. This unique, one-of-a-kind, masterfully shot, edited, and acted film deserves high praise - I look forward to seeing it again!"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10179354/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Lo bizarro eterno ","Voil el twisted, this time just subtly erotic and mind-blowing universe by Costas Zapas; an impressive gothic-photographic and visual design tour de force of this intertextual proposal around the nineteenth-century myth of Frankenstein. From the central canonical plot of Byron and the Shelleys, reviving the dead in the Lord's mansion in Switzerland, Costas Zapas recreates an original plot implying that all the relatives of the legendary alchemist and philosopher Dr. Frankenstein have survived since 1817, and thus , through an unusual and surreptitious (but not so much as to be absolutely unknown) contemporary staging in each new city, the "monsters" as the immortal members of the cast have become accustomed to being seen, have continued that old and atavistic eagerness towards the eternal. Upon arriving in this city - undetermined, it is better to repeat and it is something that I will not stop personally blaming on Zapas - the premiere of the strange work "Frankenstein" arouses curiosity and I suspect media and journalism, since there are no photographs or abundant information about the Theater Company or the artists who will present the play. Based? In Mary Shelley. The reporter will insist on interviewing the cast members and in the course, she will be approached by strange subjects who will gradually force her to redirect her initial search and, at the same time, remember that she herself is Elizabeth Lavenza, the girlfriend of then Dr. Frankenstein who is led at the final dinner before the premiere to remember and relive the events that he has denied for more than two centuries and for which the others, Alphonse Frankenstein, the father of the young Dr., William the younger brother and the other characters in the play - such as Adele or the blind caretaker and her two daughters - who have been part of her life in some way over and over again. I have said it in other places and I repeat, Costas Zapas has plenty of what 90 percent of contemporary directors and writers lack, but his innate avant-garde vein that is evident is inherent, it is lackluster when adapted to the plastic cinematographic, as if he lost himself in continuity, perhaps due to the lack of other voices on his work before filming it or before presenting it, or as if Zapas supposed that the leap to better rethink the scenography would weaken its originality. For example, personally and without being a film critic but except for a movie buff, I consider this work could be staged in a village in a royal canton, say in Saint-Germer-de-Fly or Chartres, or similar ones in Spain or the United Kingdom, where the environment would have more realistically affected the results of the work."

The elements mix well for a hilarious romp around LA while weaving an important narrative centering on current fears of workplace harassment and Big Tech spying on (and monetizing) our deepest secrets. This is the Millennial answer to the impending midlife life crisis that is office place malaise and having our most personal data exposed all over the web. Come for the prescient story on the corruption of big data, stay for the psychedelics-fueled trip with a monkey in a jungle mansion.The entire cast is very solid, but Jonathan Bennett especially knocks his comedic performance out of the park, which pairs well with Owen Harn's Tarzan-themed techno villain. Chris Coppola is perfectly sleazy, Bob Wiltfong shows up to crush your soul and make you laugh out loud all at once, and Maria Conchita Alonso even sneaks in for some hilarious guest work with Emanuel Hernandez as her son in the funniest liquor-store-operating duo this side of Hollywood.

Mitry, I didn't know what I was in for. I hadn't heard about the movie, nor did I know what it was about. But I still opted to sit down to watch "My True Fairytale".And I did, well sort of. I gave up on the movie with just 20 minutes left to watch. But by then I was so bored out of my mind that I just couldn't take another minute of this ordeal of a movie. The storyline was utter rubbish and had so little appeal to me. In fact, I didn't really know what the movie was about, so it made little sense most of the things that transpired on the screen.The storyline was just rubbish and nonsense. So I wasn't by any means entertained by the storyline told in "My True Fairytale". And it didn't really help much that the characters were essentially one-dimensional cardboard cut-outs that served little or no purpose really in the story.I will say, though, that the cast ensemble was good, and they definitely had some interesting and good choices of actors and actresses to fill out and portray the roles in the movie. Just a shame that they were given so very little to work with in terms of a properly written storyline and had poorly detailed characters to portray.While I gave up with just 20 minutes to go before "My True Fairytale" ended, I must say that I have absolutely no plans to return to watch the rest of the movie, because there was just nothing that appealed to me here.My rating of writer and director D. Mitry's 2021 movie lands on a generous two out of ten stars. This was a swing and a miss in terms of a properly entertaining movie."

And Angie (the main character of the movie) and how she touches each character's life is the true representation of that superpower. If you lost a loved one or if you just want to watch a movie that touches you deeply and lifts you up, watch this movie.

Fact in the project, the chemistry between the two actors is non-existent, I had a lot of trouble believing their story especially with the little time they share together on the screen, well the character of the father seems to me to be interpreted well enough but at times the character's diction seems to me exaggerated and incomprehensible or even inaudible, the realization does not show much imagination, with a lot of eclipse that could have perhaps been shown on the screen by the passage of time instead of a banal under the title "2 weeks later" or "5 winters later". The moral of the story is eagerly awaited which is surely normal for a book over a century old but the script brings it to a very agreed upon way and seen thousands of times. The landscapes are quite beautiful even if we do not really see their immensity which could have made us perhaps more feel the loneliness and isolation of Eugenie."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10207710/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," Grim Crime Thriller with a Sturdy Cast ","Indeed, there is no end of action in writer & director Michele Civetta's "The Gateway," a grimy little thriller about an ex-con Mike (Zach Avery of "The White Crow") released from prison and goes back to serve his crime boss Duke (Frank Grillo of "Warrior"), while making life miserable for his wife Dahlia (Olivia Munn of "Ride Along 2") and his young daughter Ashley (Taegen Burns of "Blue Ridge"). Actually, it is a seedy little drama about a variety of losers. At the center of this mayhem stands the social worker hero, Parker (Shea Whigham of "The Lincoln Lawyer"). Whigham delivers a bravura performance, and you won't take your eyes off him. He is genuinely concerned about the people that he is compelled to help. Primarily, an orphan raised within the system himself who was abandoned by his gifted musician father Marcus (Bruce Dern of "Nebraska"), Parker lives to serve others until an obnoxious co-worker goads him into punching him out. Parker's superior hates this turn of events as much as she abhors having to fire him. Meantime, after Mike is back home running his wife and daughter crazy, he goes after a big score that belongs to the cartel. Ultimately, he stashes three bricks of heroin in his daughter's bag. Of course, Mike lied to Ashley about the contents, and she was told it was a gift for her mother. The relationship between Dahlia and Mike is a battlefield. Dahlia is desperate for help, and she turns to Parker. Valiantly, Parker intervenes again, but he has lost his job and the authority that came with it. The ending is downbeat. If you're expecting Frank Grillo to be in the middle of this fracas, you are going to be disappointed. He is confined to the periphery. "The Gateway" qualifies as an atmospheric thriller that won't satisfy with its abrasive ending."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10207710/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt"," Ridiculously and annoyingly bad. ","I really feel sorry for Grillo, Munn and even Dern (who's been horrible in many other bad movies lately, but was actually good in this one) for having their names attached to this far-fetched ridiculous wannabe crime-drama-thriller pretentious mess.Although Whigham's performance was decent, his character was cringeworthy, laughable, and annoyingly unconvincing. His James Dean wannabe look and demeanor did him zero justice, as did his unrealistic and ridiculous character's attempt to portray a social worker. The casting director needs to get fired for that call, as do the writers.To make matters worse, there were actually three writers that came together to give us this nonsense; a (pulling out a mini-bottle out of thin-air) alcoholic chain-smoking drug-using gun-wielding emotional-baggage-carrying straight-faced low-monotonic dude-too-cool licensed city social worker? It may have worked as a comedic parody, but in this case, it was as I already mentioned, cringeworthy, laughable, and annoyingly unconvincing. Don't even get me started on the massive plot and technical issues.The pacing was so slow with many unnecessary and long winded scenes, that the normally time-flies 91 min runtime felt like almost 3 hours. The screenplay was so dull, static and stale, I couldn't wait to get to the end. Aside from the last 10 mins of (somewhat) action, there were zero thrills in this thriller, and the drama was melodramatic in a soap-opera way.And what was the point of the last 3+ mins of church choir singing? Then right after adding "In the United States, 250,000 children enter the foster care system every year", is an embarrassment to the foster system by portraying Whigham as a "licensed city social worker". What's the point to that message relating to this film? "Hopefully none of those 250,000 children will end up with such an unprofessional and unqualified social worker like Parker" lmao? Adding that statistic doesn't make the film any better, it makes it much worse.One of those writers, Michele Civetta, also directed this mess. Using fish-eye lens and slow-mo scenes is something I'd expect to see in a 5th grade drama class production - from the 90's. His directing overall was amateurish at best, and he failed in directing his cast properly, with the exception of Grillo, who clearly carried his own weight perfectly without any need for cast direction. The score was ok, but the soundtrack was overbearing. I really can't think of anything redeeming about this film, it was such a disappointment.It's a shame so much good talent was wasted in this nonsense. I'm giving this a very generous 4/10, more so out of pity for some of my favorite actors having this mess on their resume."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10207710/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," Turn out to be a great movie. ","What the Getaway has going for it is that it was a drama with these little bits of action in it. That was perfect for people like me who may not have been up for the drama and the action was on point.I saw Frank Grillo is in it and that was a bonus. Grillo seems to be becoming that type of star power that can show up in three or four scenes in a movie and legitimately sell the movie by putting him on the poster.Olivia Munn is in it too. Looks like she's trying something different to widen her acting skills. She's in luck getting to share the screen with a season actor like Bruce Dern.But the most interesting and fascinating cast member was Shea Whigham. This is a man who spent most of his career as a supporting actor now stepping up to the plate as lead actor, and doing a bang up job with it.The drama is grimm but well played, and the action was fast and effective. I thought this movie was perfect."

He's a former boxer who lost his way in life, a father who abandoned him and his mother when he was younger and tried to channel his energy as a boxer robbed of a good chance at success into helping others.Olivia Munn is the damsel in distress who can't help herself, especially when her husband (or ex) is released from jail and comes home... but still wants to pull of jobs with his old boss, Frank Grillo (who is rarely in the film.)The problem with this film is that it doesn't really go anywhere much of the time. It's meant to be a long character study but even that isn't so revealing. He has a conflict with his old man and it's nothing we haven't seen a million times. Dad, I resent you, won't ever ask anything from you, etc. Etc.Olivia Munn plays the most inept mother on the planet. Wigham tries to help her and keep her job, child, stability but she resents him. Olivia's ex comes back and danger and jealousy and suspicion is about.This should have been a much, much better film. The acting is actually quite good - from all but Munn who just doesn't sell the role, perhaps it is the script which makes her into an inconsiderate blubberer all the time. It fails for the most part as a character study as there is only a limited look into what drives this man to be a social worker and a twist that happens is incredibly lame and feels like a forced plot device. And in the end, the movie goes where many predictable films go where the writer wants you to go "Oh.... wow man... that's deep. That's heavy and an emotional hit" and it really isn't. The very ending is also intended to be clever and i could see where it was going but, it too, was a little too unnatural in the attempt to be cute and clever.This is not a terrible movie and Wigham is very good in his character. Like others say, unfortunately, it just doesn't really go anywhere and is just a simple story of the reformed loser who tries his hardest to go the extra mile to help out this one irritating woman and her son so they can stay together and protected from her dangerous ex. That's it."

Scary parts.. Visually impressive and realistic effects. Proper dialogue. Interesting character. A scary killer. An entertaining storyline. Good acting. Well, take all those and chug them, because that is not what you are in for when - and if - you sit down to watch the 2021 horror movie "Bloody Nun 2: The Curse". Which I must urge you not to do.This movie was without a doubt one of the worst horror movie experiences I have had to suffer through. And it wasn't even bad in the way that it becomes cheesy, watchable and enjoyable. No. This was just plain and simple bad. Capital B, bad.The storyline in "Bloody Nun 2: The Curse" definitely had some interesting enough aspects to it, but it was just cut down brutally by an inadequate character gallery, cringeworthy dialogue, laughable special effects, and a total lack of anything even remotely scary or original.Needless to say that the acting in "Bloody Nun 2: The Curse" was dubious at best. This whole ordeal felt like a high school movie project.Do not waste your time, money or effort on "Bloody Nun 2: The Curse". Some of us did so you don't have to. Spare yourself the agony.It is amazing, though, the a movie such as "Bloody Nun 2: The Curse" actually manages to make it to the press and actually get distributed. It is incredibly that no one here stopped and raised a hand at any given point during the creation of this 2021 movie and said "hey, wait just a minute..."My rating of "Bloody Nun 2: The Curse" lands on a one out of ten stars. Definitely within the top 10 of bad horror movies I have ever stumbled upon."

Phillips takes it and dies pretty much instantly. That means I'm going to be seeing a lot of goofs trying that, too.Then, we see the confession of Father Gordon Herschell, nudge nudge, and hear Father Gabriel discuss all the wink wink he wants at the local brothel.With that, we have begun Bloody Nun 2.Will Collazo Jr. also directed the original Bloody Nun, which this has a small tie to at the end. It's a horror comedy and your mileage may vary when it comes to how funny you find it. I mean, how many movies will you see where an evil nun bites a man's prized possession clean off? Probably just this one.Also: Bloody Nun works exactly like Bloody Mary, except that she attacks her victims in a brothel. So there's that.This is the kind of movie that's on the shelf at WalMart just to fool folks into thinking that it's a Valek-related movie. It is not nunsploitation either, as those movies require multiple nuns.Basically, if you want to watch a $3,000 nun-related horror movie, this is here for you in all its holy glory.

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10216812/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","2"," Yes, this series is a curse ","Bloody Nun 1 was a very cheap lame movie. It must have gotten enough views that the director decided to make another.Now the nun has turned into a Bloody Mary type challenge where she picks off Shawn C Phillips being Shawn C Phillips.Then the movie goes into some random people talking in someone's backyard and a horny priest. He decides to go to a brothel inside someone's empty house. The guy who runs it thought he was playing a cool character by wearing sunglasses and a cane and talking with a raspy voice.A lot of weird men come to the brothel and the two women (including genre regular Tina Krause, looking very sad here) only have sex with the boss instead of the men. One of them summons the nun finally because he has nothing else to do.Here the killings kick into high gear but unless you like dollar store halloween props or some of the worst cgi that even a high schooler would get a C on for class, there is nothing to enjoy.They had a decent concept, but lazy and inept filmmaking ruin all enjoyment."

This whole movie is exactly like a school project I would have made back in my middle school movie class. The acting is SO bad, my 12 year old cousin could've definitely done better than these people. The audio was absolutely horrible, along with the cheap costumes and ridiculous editing skills. The pastor looked like an expired toe with that costume. Any music that was used in this movie didn't fit any of the scenes at all. I swear they definitely used snapchat filters in this movie. Don't even get me started on that annoying vlog guy. He dragged on the first scene for almost 5 minutes, and that's when I knew this movie was going to he downright horrible. Some of the lines in this movie were really questionable and weird as well, and they made me uncomfortable . Along with the camera angles. So weird and bad. I could've made a better movie with my eyes closed while sitting on the toilet. In all honesty, I watched as much as I did because I was making fun of every little bit of this movie.

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10220406/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," Slow paced and rather uneventful... ","I must admit that I was initially lured into watching this 2021 movie titled "Royal Jelly" given the movie's cover/poster. I found that to be rather interesting, and the movie's synopsis also made it seem like there could be potential to writer and director Sean Riley's movie."Royal Jelly" certainly was a watchable movie, although it just didn't really manage to be outstanding. And this was hardly a memorable movie viewing experience for me, as the storyline and the events that took place throughout the course of the movie were just a bit too generic.The acting performances in "Royal Jelly" were adequate. I wasn't familiar with the cast in this movie, but I found that the actors and actresses performed well enough in the movie. I do enjoy watching unfamiliar talents in movies, I will admit that, so it was a shame that the performers in the movie just had mediocre contents to work with in terms of script, storyline, dialogue and characters.Visually then "Royal Jelly" was okay. There wasn't anything spectacular to behold here. So don't expect to be in for a visual roller coaster.For a horror movie, then "Royal Jelly" was bland and offered nothing interesting or innovative to the genre. So as a life-long horror fan, then writer and director Sean Riley just didn't manage to impress me.My rating of "Royal Jelly" lands on a generous four out of ten stars."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10220406/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","2"," Bees. ","Sean Riley is the the principal of Benndale Elementary School in George County, Mississippi by day, but by night, he wrote and directed this movie all about a school outcast who becomes a human bee groomed to be the next queen of the hive. This is his second full-length movie after 2017's Fighting Belle, in which a Southern belle left at the altar becomes a boxer.This is a movie rich in bees and the honey they help produce, as nearly all the main character's names are the names of wildflowers which bees pollinate and the term royal jelly refers to the secretion produced by glands of the hypopharynx in nurse honey bees. This is fed to all the lavrae as they grow, but mostly saved for the future queen bee as she rests in her cell within the hive.The film's heroine is Aster, who is that most rare of combinations - so rare I've never heard it it before - known as the goth beekeeper. That means that nobody likes her at school at all and she's treated worse at home thanks to her new stepmother and stepsister, who have taken her father's attention away from her.Luckily - or perhaps not for the victims in this film - a new teacher comes to the school that loves bees just as much as her. And she takes in our protagonist after her stepsister and friends crush all of her hives.This is a horror movie, so this isn't about an older teacher grooming a sensitive young girl to the Sapphic delights of the world. That would be an Italian movie from 1978 or somesuch. This is a direct-to-streaming video in which someone grows fairy wings and fangs as they become a human bee and get their stinging revenge.So yeah. It's Carrie with bees and no revenge for the heroine. And it's not the best bee movie even. That would maybe be Invasion of the Bee Girls. It's also not anywhere as good as Phenomena, but very few movies are. There is a good idea here, but there's not the budget or the follow-through to make it anything better than what it is. Some bees make delicious honey, others just sting you, but the pain eventualluy goes away."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10220406/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","3"," An underwhelming and highly flawed effort ","Trying to get through school, a teen obsessed with bees grows distraught over living with her step-family and eventually is forced from home by a cruel prank to stay with a mysterious teacher she befriended one day, but the longer she stays there she comes to believe something deadly is happening to her.This was a highly underwhelming and generally uninteresting effort. When this one works is due pretty much solely to the uneasy setup that had the potential to be somewhat interesting. The work done on the farmhouse that keeps her there, with the bizarre work involving the series of impressive double-entendre referencing what's really going on. As it twists around whether or not the intentions behind the abduction are true or what's really going on, the sense of unease and confusion here is quite enjoyable. While it also tends to rush through the action at the end, it's still somewhat enjoyable to watch play out as it does since there's finally some kinetic activity happening with these campy creatures that give this somewhat goofy enough of an atmosphere to be entertaining. There are a few big issues to be had with this one. The main factor with the film is the utterly dull and drab setup that manages to rely far more on uninteresting family drama than anything resembling a genre effort. Featuring a truly cliched disastrous home-life that borders on the unwatchable with the exploits of the teen step-daughter bullying her mercilessly, the step-mother doing everything in her power to encourage it while the dad is spinless to stand up against it despite his best intentions to protect her, this is mixed together with a barely-evolved bullying setup at school that pegs her as an outcast against her step-sister and her friends. This is all completely expected and not in the slightest interesting or chilling enough to matter. In addition to this setup, the film's second half is a series of weird and illogical decision-making that really dooms this one considerably. Their friendship together is underwritten and barely there, essentially being one meet-up following several failed encounters that border on psychotic, borderline-criminal stalking that never feels genuine or realistic. This in turn makes the retreat to her remote house in the country that seems to slowly evolve into her transforming into some kind of queen bee come off even odder, with the incident looking like a straight-up kidnapping that no one goes to check up on as she disappears in the middle of the night to live with a stranger at a remote house away from everyone else. It's incredibly sketchy and suspect which also ends up furthering the blandness as nothing happens here either. The last flaw here, which is quite bad but isn't nearly as detrimental as the other issues, is the films' wholly cheap and underwhelming effects work featured throughout. While the burn-marks are generally okay, they're the only features that look good here with the transformations being absolutely comical and hysterical funny more than anything, especially with the design as much as the prosthetics utilized. The vampire-like fangs are just absolutely ludicrous a concept since they're a feature not on the actual creature and look just as goofy as the half-human/half-bee hybrid that follows, which when all combined together with the other issues here really hamper the film overall.Rated Unrated/R: Graphic Language and Violence."

","I stumbled upon "616 Wilford Lane" by random chance, and of course I sat down to watch it, as I hadn't already seen it before. But as I hadn't even heard about this movie from writers Howard Burd, Dante Yore and Mark S. Allen, then I didn't know what to expect.Granted, I wasn't really harboring much of any high hopes for the movie, as it had Eric Roberts on the cast list, but thankfully he was not in the movie all that much.And the movie started out fairly okay, not great, but adequately entertaining. And it was fun enough to watch what was going on, especially since the movie was gradually building up with the pseudo-spooky stuff, which wasn't actually spooky, but I suppose it was meant to appear to be.And then the movie takes a very unforeseen turn towards the end, and I must admit that it felt like a slap to the face with a cold, dead fish. That turn of events was just laughably bad.But wait, it gets better, because the movie takes another turn after that, just when you get to digest that first twist. And that second twist, just rams in the knife of excruciating laughable pain even further. And I have to admit that the movie instantly went from being mediocre to below mediocre with that first twist of events, and then fell down to insulting with the second twist of events.Of course I am not going to spoil the movie by giving away the ending here, but wow, come on. That was just ludicrous. And I must than writers Howard Burd, Dante Yore and Mark S. Allen from the bottom of my heard for virtually wasting 1 hour and 25 minutes of my life with this heap of garbage called "616 Wilford Lane".John Littlefield really carried the movie quite well with his performance in the movie, despite of how much I abhor the storyline after this ending I was served. But I will say that he really performed quite well and put on a very believable performance in "616 Wilford Lane".It should be said that the character gallery in the movie was actually quite good and the writers had definitely put some effort into establishing the characters and make them feel like people you could relate to. At least "616 Wilford Lane" had that working for it.I am sure that there is an audience out there for a movies such as "616 Wilford Lane", just turned out that I wasn't a member of that particular audience, because I feel cheated.I am rating "616 Wilford Lane" a generous two out of ten stars based on the initial build up of the movie. I can't say that I care one bit about the dual twists towards the end of the movie, no, not one bit."

As promising as his early career was, seeing the name Eric Roberts near the top of a cast list has become as much of a red flag as Tara Reid or Richard Grieco. But I was swayed by a professional "reviewer," one who must take kick-backs.Following a prologue that owes a debt to the Amityville, NY DeFeo family, in which we see "security cam" footage of a young man slaughter his family and then himself, we are introduced to a family in the midst of losing its matriarch to cancer. Soon after, the remaining members relocate to the very house in which the prologue murders occurred, though they're not informed of its history.Is there something evil in the house? Will it possess any of its new occupants to repeat history? I've never written spoilers before, but this flick pissed me off, so here goes: The answer to both questions above is yes. And then it's no. After watching almost the entire movie follow a by-the-numbers haunted house formula, one that's completely devoid of actual scares. There's a tacked-on ending that shows that the home's new occupants aren't a family at all, but a group of grifters who staged the "supernatural" experiences they had in the house in order to score a big payday by way of lawsuits over the failure to disclose its history. Say what?!?It'd be one thing if, billed as a horror movie, it provided any creepy atmosphere, tension, or scares, but it doesn't, with the possible exception of the prologue, which is then never addressed/resolved. It'd be another thing if it billed itself as a drama, or crime drama, but it doesn't. The way it plays out, it really looks as if the producers watched the dumpster fire of a horror movie they had, realized it wasn't at all horrific, and decided to tack on this left-field "twist" they thought was clever, but turned the whole flick into something else entirely. So who gets grifted? The viewer, that's who. Oh, and the indigenous group that someone swindled into footing the bill for this turd."

The movie opens with a dying woman saying goodbye to her husband and two gorgeous gals.....then the funeral...then the move to a gated community to escape grieving .The usual security footage of room to room goes bye and reveals a sleepwalker getting a rifle and killing his family and then himself.Jim and the girls , Staci & Randy move in to the mansion and start experiencing ghostly occurrences . The Sherriff gets involved to no avail. The Mayor ( Eric Roberts and his real wife ) and wife welcome them and then you don't see them until later in the film for a minute .The girls meet boys and do the flirt & tease thing in a few scenes and then all of them experience ghostly happenings.The last 10 minutes are just too complicated to explain after Staci sleepwalks and tries to shoot Randy until Jim returns to save the day and get the family out of the real estate deal for millions more than he paid.The part I didn't get is why Jim was having sex with his daughter and celebrating pulling off a scam of scariness to rip off the realters of millions . Then Staci poisons Jim and Randy and drives off with all the cash . They flashback to Robin ( mother ) dying and whispering in Staci's ear to kill Jim for no given back story of a reason .Overall, I enjoyed the movie , waiting to be scared and waiting for the gratuitus nudity that never occurred, thus making it a good security footage thriller with a HUGE twist of an ending."

Also, Cody's shotgun could have been used at the end because Staci insinuated that her mother wasn't the issue and she could live without her.I think this film would have done much better financially if it was released under a bigger banner.This was way better than the other movie I watched yesterday... uh, I think it's called "Mortal Kombat.""

When he's murdered, she seeks revenge while police detectives Vicars (Bobby Cannavale) and Nevin (Laverne Cox) investigate.The idea is interesting but it starts to wear thin sooner than expected. The first part's issue is that it gets repetitive. She has murderous vision, she gets a jolt, and the scene resets to normal. It happens over and over again. Once the premise is stated, the whole series of cinematic moves is not needed. The comedy needs to be better and I'm not sure that Kate Beckinsale can deliver it. She can definitely deliver the cool but she struggles to lead in this one. I like the start but the movie peters out over time."

Or rather her rage is not aimed at one gender (or non gender for that matter). It is Kate Beckinsale and she does kick ... and punches what is in front of her, when she feels the urge to do so. Now hearing that from the start you should be able to understand that suspension of disbelief is necessary.The story is really easy to follow to put it mildly and nicely. There is also a twist that I think anyone who has seen a few movies can see from miles away. Maybe it isn't a twist at all - or just for a few people. Whatever the case, have I mentioned that Kate Beckinsale stars in this? Atomic Blonde one might say - if that wasn't already the title of another movie.There is not much substance here, but quite some action and even more humor. Again do not try to make sense of it all - you wouldn't be able to. Also remember: Kate Beckinsale is in this! All kidding aside, it isn't just Kate (though the humor of her character seems to be close to her own, judging from her social media and interviews, in a good way), but also some interesting other casting choices.

",""Jolt" - not to be confused with "Bolt", a movie about a dog with a lightning streak on his back. Though in this case, the film's protagonist needs an electrical charge to control her aggressive tendencies, something she derives from a vest full of electrodes she wears that attach to her body. Lindy (Kate Beckinsale) has Intermittent Explosive Disorder, a condition I'm sure the script writer needed time to come up with so that it's acronym matched that of an Improvised Explosive Device. Yes, Lindy is a walking and talking IED, who goes on a rampage after her one and only boyfriend (OK, that's up for debate) is murdered after only the second date. What follows is pretty much what you'd expect in a mindless romp of car chases and fight scenes in which our average sized heroine routinely battles and pulverizes brutes twice her size. There's a twist that comes at the finale regarding said dead boyfriend, which further propels the story into the land of disbelief suspension, but by that time the astute viewer will probably have figured it out. Lest you think I'm being too critical of the picture, I did find it quite entertaining, and Beckinsale is a super powered IED with a look that's easy on the eyes. And she has amazing recuperative powers, evidenced by the fact that she's up and walking around with no problem at all after getting shot in the leg by a detective who has his eyes on the prize."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10228134/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Silly but a lot of fun ","Lindy has severe anger management issues. She suffers from intermittent explosive disorder; this means anybody who irritates her is likely to experience her murderous rage. Various people have tried to help her or at least channel her rage to their purposes with no success. Finally she finds a psychiatrist who gives her a vest that is wired so she can give herself an electric shock if she feels she is about to lose control. The condition makes it almost impossible to form relationships but one day she meets a man, Justin the accountant, who she doesn't feel urged to hurt... he might even be 'the one'. Unfortunately he ends up dead in a dumpster with two bullets in his head. Lindy is unimpressed with the police response so decides to track down the killer herself... for once her propensity for violence might serve her rather than ruin her life.If you are looking for realism or something vaguely sensible then this probably isn't the film for you; if on the other hand you plenty of solid action and just enough plot to justify it this is well worth watching. There is plenty of action from start to finish; this mostly means fighting but there is also an entertaining car chase, a couple of explosions and an amusing chase through a hospital. Kate Beckinsale impresses as Lindy; we know a woman her size couldn't beat up the large men she has to fight but if you can suspend ones disbelief it doesn't seem too silly... she can certainly pull off the moves in the well choreographed fight scenes. Bobby Cannavale and Laverne Cox as Detective Vicars and Detective Nevin are solid; I know some viewers weren't keen on having a trans cop but I thought she was a fun character. Tanya Wexler did a fine job directing. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to anybody wanting ninety minutes of action and nothing too serious."

","It is very puzzling that there are a number of very negative reviews with "1" or "2" ratings. I suspect those didn't even watch this movie. Look at the distribution of ratings, most are in the "5", "6" and "7" categories. It definitely is not a "1" or a "2".Beckinsale is great as the young woman who battles with impulse control, and with her great strength and speed can wreak lots of havoc if she is so inclined. She uses a self-administered shock ("jolt") to keep herself from following through when something agitates her. Most of the time. It should not be taken any more seriously than an action comic book, not everything has to be plausible. Plus there is an interesting thread of a story there. Did you know in war they taught dogs to go towards enemy tanks, with a bomb strapped to them?But it is mostly hilarious with inventive situations and inventive dialog. But caution, the language is often really hard-R rated.

","Well, this was actually a nice surprise of a movie.When I sat down to watch the 2021 Amazon original movie titled "Jolt", I wasn't really sure what I was getting myself into. I hadn't heard about the movie prior to sitting down to watch it. But with it being a movie that I hadn't already seen, and it having Kate Beckinsale on the cast list, of course I had to watch it.As it turned out then writer Scott Wascha actually managed to put together a wholesome storyline and plot that made for an entertaining movie. Sort of if you think "Crank 2" but with a twist, then you have "Jolt".I was genuinely entertained by what director Tanya Wexler managed to do with Scott Wascha's script. The movie was fast paced, had an interesting concept and interesting characters, and it was actually good old fun from start to end.It was nice to see Kate Beckinsale in a role as she played in "Jolt", and she was nicely cast for the movie. But the movie also have some interesting casted performers, such as Stanley Tucci, Bobby Cannavale, Susan Sarandon and David Bradley on the cast list.If you enjoy a fast paced action thriller, where you just lean back, munch on the snacks while enjoying a fast paced ride, then "Jolt" is definitely a movie well-worth watching.My rating of "Jolt" lands on a six out of ten stars."

","Tanya Wexler has assembled an half-decent cast for this film, but sadly her execution - accompanied by a really poor script - offers us precious little to hold our attention. "Lindy" (Kate Beckinsale) manages to control her frequent bouts of violence by way of a vest that delivers electronic pulses into her body to calm her down. Without said gadget, she is lethal! She falls in love with "Justin" (Jai Courtney) - but when he is killed, she is bent on revenge and carnage ensues. Snag is, though it is quite an innovative concept, the plot has something of the video game about it. The vest serves as her reset button, but also as our's - the story moves on, then stops, goes back, starts again etc. It's cyclical and repetitive and Beckinsale just seems to be trying to resurrect the sort of character she had in the "Underworld" series - in which she was generally much better. There are also a few scenes from an off-form Stanley Tucci as "Dr. Munchin" - who devised her self-control mechanism, but they don't really add much to the general lack of menace or peril on display. It passes the time, this - the production standards are quite decent - but the story just runs out of steam far too early on and I was, frankly, rather bored by the middle let alone the end."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10228134/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," A Fun Movie with Plenty of Action ",""Underworld" actress Kate Beckinsale toplines "Hysteria" director Tanya Wexler's far-fetched, feminist, action fantasy "Jolt" (***1/2 OUT OF ****) as a doll suffering from anger management woes. The only relief for her "Intermittent Explosive Disorder" is self-induced shock treatment conditioning to curb her violent pugnacity. Basically, her savvy psychiatrist has created a Pavlovian mesh vest consisting of electrodes that transmit electricity to zap our heroine when she feels the urge to harm others. Clocking in at a nimble 90 minutes, this crackerjack outing in formula filmmaking bristles with surprises galore because you never know what our heroine is going to do. "Jolt" unfolds with a montage of Lindy wrestling hopelessly as a child with anger management. We're told she came from a broken home, with an alcoholic father and a mother slept too much. "Some people cry," Lindy enlightens her sympathetic therapist, Dr. Munchin (Stanley Tucci of "The Hunger Games"), during an office visit. "Some people drink," she adds. "Some people write s**t poetry. I hurt people." Consequently, Lindy has never been a people person until she meets a young, handsome, bespectacled accountant, Justin (Aussie actor Jai Courtney of "Suicide Squad"), on a blind date. They follow up with each other on a second date.Just as she is learning how to love somebody, Lindy Lewis learns to her chagrin that Justin has been murdered. The police pull his body from a dumpster with two bullets in his skull. This revelation makes Lindy's blood boil with rage. The police order her to stand down, but she launches her own investigation. Moreover, she sneaks into police headquarters and rifles their evidence locker for clues. Afterward, her life spins out of control into chaos. Before Lindy realizes it, not only do the police want to arrest her, but also the people behind Justin's homicide decide to knock her off. Although "Jolt" surges from one smackdown to another, with plenty of careening car chases and lots of sadistic dastards out to deep-six her, Lindy never gives an inch unless she is taking a pound out of her adversaries. Lindy's anonymous physician from childhood (Best Actress Oscar-winner Susan Sarandon of "Dead Man Walking") fills us in on Lindy's terrible ailment. "Her condition made her extremely volatile and far, far angrier than normal. Lindy had a hair trigger. Once provoked, she would snap." You'd think this gimmicky actioneer would run out of energy, but the voltage in "Jolt" never slackens. Lindy's odyssey into the criminal underworld that Justin served constitutes a series of Herculean labors as she struggles to learn the identity of Justin's killer. One unforgettable scene finds our indefatigable heroine scrambling desperately through a hospital with a trigger-happy, African American cop, Detective Nevin (Laverne Cox of "Charlie's Angels" reboot) at her heels. Unlike her partner Detective Vicars (Bobby Cannavale of "Snakes on a Plane"), who allows Lindy the benefit of the doubt, Nevin cuts her no slack. Nevin has no qualms about shooting Lindy. Cornered in a newborn nursery, Lindy faces the pistol packing Nevin with her finger on the trigger. Out of the blue, Lindy seizes a bundle of newborn joy and treats it like a hot potato. Meaning, she laterals the baby to Nevin like a football . The detective has no choice but to catch the kid rather than plug Lindy. Miraculously, Lindy escapes this close encounter with Nevin and continues her investigation. Earlier, she had interrupted an underground fight and offered to beat up any three men if a snitch will give her the identity of Justin's killer. Lindy is willing to deck three of the toughest guys, but the snitch insists she handle all three at the same time. Non-plussed, Lindy accepts his terms and reduces the trio to piles of quivering flesh.Inevitably, Lindy meets her match. This evil fellow, Delacroix (Ori Pfeffer of "Hacksaw Ridge"), manages to get the drop on our usually alert heroine. Worse, in a fluke of circumstances, he knocks her out. When she recovers, Lindy finds herself zip-tied to a chair, while her sadistic nemesis activates a machine designed to drain blood from the body. Spontaneously, in a fit of titanic rage, Lindy snaps both zip-ties. She hurls herself out of the chair and hammers Delacroix with merciless fists until he babbles everything she wants to hear. Eventually, Lindy learns the truth about Justin's demise while trying to veer clear of the two detectives and the underworld minions that harass her at every turn. The repartee between the good cop Vicars and the bad cop Nevin adds to the comic relief. Eventually, Lindy learns Dr. Munchkin hasn't been entirely honest with her about her condition.Director Tanya Wexler doesn't let the momentum slacken between several hyperbolic action scenes that will prompt you to shadow box to Lindy's shenanigans. She doesn't pull her punches either, while everybody from our heroine to her adversaries never play by the rules. The voltage in "Jolt" never dims and neither does Kate Beckinsale's charismatic wattage. Of course, it qualifies as all-around preposterous pabulum, but every sizzling minute of it is a blast. The sight of this slender damsel with her patrician British accent smashing her opponents, like a heavyweight palooka, into pitiless submission is a cathartic treat you may enjoy more than once."

I learned not to pay too much attention anymore to the extremely negative reviews (and extremely positive as well). I get that some might not like this genre of movies, and there's nothing wrong with that, but scoring it the lowest possible is just ridiculous unless you don't watch a lot of movies. I watched thousands of movies in my life so I can recognize a stinker but Jolt isn't one of them. Jolt is entertainment from beginning till the end. The story is what it is, not to be taken serious, the kind you watch with a bucket of popcorn. As for the acting, it was good, and that from the whole cast. Kate Beckinsale looks like she never ages, still very good looking and certainly not looking her age. She can act so it's pleasant to watch her. I wouldn't mind another Jolt to be honest, a sequel could be possible, and I would definitely watch it."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10228134/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," Could've Been More Shocking ","That Kate Beckinsale, weighing all of a "buck-o-eight," as it's suggested at one point, beats up a bunch of burly goons without as much as getting a scratch on her doesn't bother me nearly as much as the notion of an accountant being that buff. I mean, she's got some whatever make-believe medical condition that gives her anger problems super strength, so that checks out by movie logic. Hulk if his pupils dilated instead of him turning into a giant green Mr. Hyde monster. But, how was anyone supposed to believe the jacked Jai Courtney is a boring accountant? Talk about suspension of disbelief.Anyways, how is "Jolt" not a comic-book superhero movie? Marvel does have a heroine named "Jolt," I see, but apparently she's unrelated, and this is supposedly an original scenario... well, not too original. Just last week, Netflix released their own pulpy female assassin revenge flick, "Gunpowder Milkshake" (2020), that every other person will compare to "John Wick" (2014). Amazon not to be outdone, here we are again. Beckinsale's blonde hair also invites comparisons to "Atomic Blonde" (2017). Not that I'm necessarily complaining; I oft like this trashy nonsense. This one benefits from being relatively potty-mouthed and sexually perverse with Beckinsale's BDSM play of electrodes covering her torso and handcuffing herself to keep her urges in check. Her apartment number plate falls loose every time her door slams, to display "96," but I think we all know that number is upside down.Too bad there are some huge flaws here, though. The action scenes are rather poor in comparison to the aforementioned similar movies. When the cutting isn't choppy enough, it's evident that the stunt work isn't the best. Easy enough in itself to overlook, but worse is that the movie begins with five minutes of exposition, as narrated by Susan Sarandon, who only otherwise makes an appearance to establish plans for a sequel and tell the heroine, "Mr. Stark, you've become part of a bigger universe. You just don't know it, yet." Or something to that effect. I mean, is this really not based on a comic book? Someone please tell me it is. Or have we just reached the point where random action movies attempt to be the next MCU? The fantasies and flashbacks also have the appearance of "Family Guy" cutaways, and that's not a compliment.I'm especially confused, too, by nothing seeming to be done with the protagonist wanting to be a photographer, which is a highly reflexive notion (i.e. Camera as character) to throw out in a movie and not do anything with it. She also later retrieves photographs from what appears to be a film cannister. Curious. Oh, and Stanley Tucci, among other familiar faces, is in it, too."

At 47, she still looks like a 25 year old, and hot af especially in this film, of which was a great unique concept for the traditional "revenge against the rich evil villain" story. It was very entertaining and well written, especially as the first ever writing credit by Scott Wascha. It was an easy (albeit predictable) story with awesome violent action and fight choreography, with some great laughs thrown in, and some unexpected twists. It was paced perfectly for its 91 min runtime.Novice director Tanya Wexler did a might fine job with her directing. The cinematography was outstanding and the score on point. It's always a pleasure to see Stanley Tucci and Bobby Cannavale. My only complaint is that Laverne Cox should have had much more comedic dialogue, especially during the baby tossing scene (never seen that one before lmao, kudos to Wascha). And of course the lovely Miss Beckinsale did what she does best; kick ass and look gorgeous doing it.While the film could've used a little more "jolt", it's still a great Sunday couch and popcorn flick that will entertain nevertheless. You can tell the filmmakers and cast all had fun making Jolt.

I was expecting (or rather hoping) for more action than I got. What I did get did not hold up.Was not funny enough (if it was trying to be at all).

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10228134/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," A Below Average Action Film ","This film was originally slated for a theatrical release but Amazon realised that nobody would go to watch it so put it on their streaming service and I watched Jolt this morning and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a woman with medical anger issues have to go on the hunt when a man she falls for disappears.Main Character Kate Beckinsale plays the main character here and she is the best part of the film as she is really trying to carry this film on her back. She takes the poor material given her and gives this interesting protagonist that I actually ended up rooting for, despite the weak motivations. I'm not sure if there is a future for her in a franchise like this but hopefully we see her in more roles like this in the future.Supporting Characters Stanley Tucci is in this film and what more is there to say, he is great because even in the worst films he usually delivers and he does here. Some of the best scenes in the film are between Beckinsale and Tucci and its a shame there weren't slightly more. Jai Courtenay plays her romantic interest and he isn't in the film much but he just doesn't do it for me, unless he is throwing a boomerang like in The Suicide Squad I am just not interested in him and find him really bland. Bobby Cannavale and Laverne Cox play cops after her and they just offered very little, they were basically comic relief and considering that the comedy is really bad in this film it means their characters are bad.Story The story really hampers the film, it is just incredibly messy and ruins a somewhat interesting idea. I knew it was going to go wrong when there is this really awful exposition narration and it just continues with characters having poor motivations and confusing twists that just don't make any sense. The film overreaches and spends way too much time with elements of the film that aren't interesting at all and it ends up killing the film.Script The script though is the weakest part of the film, the dialogue is so bland with the drama not hitting any emotional notes or make you really care. The humour is way overplayed and it is just really bad with somebody writing this who had no idea how humans interact by forcing humour that is really out of place.Style The action in the film is okay, there are some decent pretty brutal action sequences and the film doesn't overstay its welcome with its length and the pacing is pretty good. But the action isn't standout, and there just aren't any memorable action scenes making it a pretty forgettable experience.Overall Overall, Jolt is a below average action film. There are so many action films these days that are just forgettable and this is another one with no standout reason to watch apart from Tucci and Beckinsale giving good performances."

Even worse is the amateur director who adds no suspense, intrigue or thrills to the story, so the whole thing is predictable and to order.

Which our main character does not understand at all.You could argue that he puts a lot of lives in danger of the folk who are so willing and eager to help.

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10230994/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt"," Formulaic thriller with not a creative turn by anyone involved. ","As a thriller, Beckett is a dull primer on the genre, employing every trope, gimmick, and theme ever, all in one action plot so predictable as to be risible. In addition, it is so indebted to moving the plot favorably for the titular protagonist (John David Washington) that its coincidences exceed logic.Beckett and April (Alicia Vikander-underused) are blissfully vacationing in Greece ("I think I'm having a love attack," he says-yikes for the dialogue) when their auto plows at dark into a home that just happens to be the hideout for conservatives who have kidnapped a little boy, the son of a prominent politically left candidate. Such an improbability kickstarts the plot that has the thugs tracking Beckett and nothing else.At several points that Beckett escapes, we can be assured that he will survive because of his extraordinary good luck in doing so. Each set piece of his escapes also seems disjointed enough from the main plot that it could exist outside of this film, albeit some are well executed if not fabulous.Because of his ability to get out of each tough spot, I have forgotten most of them; all I know is that Beckett cannot be stopped, despite multiple wounds. The people along the way who help him are not as lucky.Washington is durable if not a bland, a stoic face that accompanied him when he was chased in Tenet as well. Vikander remains one of the best actresses of her time even if she's gone early from Beckett when she is unfortunately delivered by her lover's sleepy driving. Lena (Vicky Krieps) is a rebel who helps him along the way to seeking refuge from his pursuers in the American embassy, another wasted talent.As for who represents what in the political part of the film, I haven't a clue except that the candidate at the rally seems to be more liberal than the organization pursuing Beckett. Netflix is the home of this disappointing thriller-even during pandemic time, I can't recommend it."

One night, they are forced to take a detour, and a car accident occurs. Beckett awakens in hospital, while Lena is tragically killed. Met with some interference when he discusses taking her body home, upon leaving the hospital, Beckett stumbles upon a conspiracy that sees him pursued by two crooked cops, drawing him in to something bigger and more deadly than he could have imagined.Fresh from his star-making turn in Christopher Nolan's most recent big budget mind bender Tenet, John David Washington follows up this big event piece with this smaller scale, but more grounded thriller from Netflix. With a title emphasising the central character, it's fitting given it focuses centrally on him, making his way through his increasingly convoluted chain of events, and not breaking away throughout.Director Ferdinando Cito Filomarino creates an eerie sense of isolationism and claustrophobia with the sunny Mediterranean outback, and deserted side streets our protagonist makes his way through, as well as a genuine air of mystery and suspense as to what's going on and the motivations behind it. He also taps in to the current social climate, with the depiction of a lone black man begging for help from the public who see him chased by police he says are accosting him for the wrong reasons. It's let down, though, by an overly drawn out ending that crushes the suspense rather than keeping you on edge, and an increasing sense of disbelief as events proceed.It's flaws stop it from being the complete sum of its parts, but Washington is still a commanding leading man with oodles of potential, and this is nothing to be sniffed at on his resume. ***"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10230994/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," Delphic American Savior ","What a nauseating beginning to what turns out to be a perfectly mediocre action movie. After going on for some 10 minutes, much more of the eponymous Beckett and his girlfriend's lovey-dovey, cutesy-wootsy foreplay, and I would've been ready to run their car off the road. These American vacationers (well, I guess Alicia Vikander is Swedish, but whatever) in Greece display some of the most irritating intimacy ever filmed, I swear--talking nonsense to each other, fondling each other while driving, drawing a heart on him--grown adults acting like horny teenagers.Otherwise, and despite what the extra-T "Beckett" might conjure regarding more thoughtful fare involving a Thomas or a Samuel Becket, this "Beckett" is a good alternative for anyone who enjoyed watching John David Washington running around in "Tenet" (2020), but would rather not engage with a complicated narrative, or those who liked the conspiratorial intrigue of him in "BlacKkKlansman" (2018), but wished the politics of it were vague to the point of irrelevance. Communists and fascists, oh my. An old-fashioned American-savior narrative, but without the white guilt, an unwitting wrong-man mystery solved during panting breaks in between fighting and chasing. The scenery is nice, though, and, granted, a movie that begins by prophesizing the hero at the ruins of the Oracle of Delphi can't be all bad, although grand, Ancient Greek tragedy this isn't. Watch the "John Wick" shoot-'em-ups for that, seriously.There's also the debatable appeal of Washington's hero not being without personal guilt and being mostly realistically human--limited by injuries, fatigue, panic attacks, an' all. Yet, he still ends up doing a Batman in a parking garage. If Washington keeps this up, Marvel or DC is going to cast him in one of their superhero burgers."

Embassies has a fringed reputation it seems.)well its a very basic production, not many cameras and shots made, and that the film turns out like it does is due to the magnificent acts by mr washington, and his co actress, cause the plot of greek politics is like a dantes inferno, and to know the greek turmoil and unrest over the last years will be of great value to understand the storyline.So dont boost your expectations, and just let yourself be sucked into the groove of the action, its not a must see film, rather a could be seen film.the grumpy old man awards with a max of 6 stars."

The combination between drama and action worked very well and the result was this beautiful movie. The interpretation of John David Washington who played as Beckett was very good and he made the difference. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Alicia Vikander's who played as April, Boyd Holbrook's who played as Tynan and Panos Koronis' who played as Officer Xenakis. To sum up, I have to say that "Beckett" is a nice movie to spend your time with and I highly recommend you to watch it."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10230994/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt"," Decent, but dull. Needed more "opa!" ","This is newb writer and director Ferdinando Cito Filomarino's first full length feature film, with five previous short films. And I'm thinking this one should've been a short as well.The 108 min runtime was way too long with more filler than substance, then add the slow pacing, and you get bored real quick. Had this film been based on actual events - and filmed verbatim, then I may have given it at least one more star, but the fact this was a fictional story, so much more could've been done - such as adding some excitement.There were moments of tension and suspense, but the cat and mouse game is nothing new, and this one was just more dull in general, and got stale real quick. I did like the setting in Greece, but again, I think more could've been done with that.The entire opening scene and the relationship with Alicia Vikander (and her minimal screen time) was overwritten, while the rest of the story and its themes were underwritten and, well, dull. The ending also seemed too rushed compared to the guts of the story from the start. A lot more action and suspense would've gone a long way in this film. However, his story execution was well thought out, with great scene transitions and coherent themes and plot.Filomarino's directing, camera work, and directing his cast was actually decent. Performances were on point, although Washington's character cried a little too much for a guy that jumps 5 floors off a parking garage. The score was actually amazing and fitting, especially for a B film.Had Filomarino trimmed off about 20 mins, and/or consulted a seasoned writer to add some "opa!" into his screenplay, this film could've been great. Nevertheless, for a newb filmmaker, he should be proud of his first full length feature."

The premise of the film sees a man trapped in Greece on the run for his life.Main Character John David Washington has been really busy lately and he plays the lead role here and he is very good in the role. He is really the only character in the film and you follow him all the way through this mad journey and his performance is easily the best part of this mess. It is a very physical performance and he just feels like your normal guy and he is the one you feel sympathy for.Supporting Characters As I said Washington is the star here and the only real character in the film despite there being some stellar talent on show here. Alicia Vikander, Boyd Holdbrook & Vicky Krieps are in this film and all of them are fine and decent as you would expect but it just feels at the same time that they are wasted. These are some great performers and they are all basically cameos who Washington comes across and that is a let down.Story The story is an absolute shambles, I still am not sure why Washington's character was on the run. The film overcomplicates every aspect of the story and I checked out after 10 mins, it struggles to engage and make you care about anything other then David Washington's strong performance. The film also has a pretty insulting ending that makes you wonder why you even bothered.Script The script is also weak, this is a boring miserable script that doesn't connect you with what exactly is going on. Whoever, wrote it clearly wanted to make this really complex thriller but it just fails miserably at it.Style The style of the film is also just a bit slow, I think this is meant to be a thriller but it doesn't have much that is thrilling about it. There are some action scenes but they don't make sense, this is an average guy who somehow turns into Batman and manages to beat people up in creative ways and it just doesn't add up. The film just isn't paced well and takes way too long to get going and doesn't keep you hooked throughout.Overall Overall, Beckett is a bad movie. It has a strong lead performance and not much else and I just don't see who it appeals to so I would give it a skip."

Washington is vacationing overseas in Greece w/his girlfriend, played by Oscar winner Alicia Vikander (frankly wasted here!) who do the usual touchstone sightseeing practices but on their way to their next pitstop at night, Washington falls asleep at the wheel causing their car to crash, go off the road & slide into a shack, breaking through its wall. Coming to, Washington sees a woman & child in the rear of the structure who quickly vanish when they see him stirring. Alas Vikander has died in the accident & as Washington is still visibly shaken by the entire episode (he wears a cast on an arm) even not telling Vikander's parents over the phone the bad news, he's definitely in a bad place. Hopefully to shake him from his obvious funk, he makes his way back to the scene of the crime where a woman appears a distance away who opens fire on him, sending Washington into the Grecian wilds hoping to get to safety. He befriends a pair of women in a town, one of which was played by Vicky Krieps (currently in Old), who give him a ride & where the obligatory exposition dump comes where we find out the boy Washington saw was presumed dead but is actually being held hostage to hold leverage over a politician running in a current election. Even finding solace at the American embassy is a pipe dream when an unctuous operative, played by Boyd Holbrook, promises sanctuary but tries to kill him as well. Not as fun as Hitchcock would've made in his day, this film still manages to fray the nerves as the audience tries to get ahead of the narrative & our sympathies fall back on the battered Washington as his situation becomes perilously worse & worse. Washington does a lot of the dramatic heavy lifting here & its to his credit he makes what could've been a mundane affair of suspense imminently watchable as he essays a man who is very real & not some superhero who'll worry about the tears later."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10230994/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Suitable if familiar political thriller ","Between initial minor exposition and the dramatic turn, early scenes feel a bit common, suggesting right away we could be watching any politically-tinged thriller from cinema spanning decades. The notable uptick in intrigue as the plot begins in earnest is more actively engaging, and holds our attention well. 'Beckett' isn't the most wholly original film in the world, but it's duly entertaining, and well made.It's easy to be low-key drawn to star John David Washington, as he bears definite warmth and charisma. I think this is the first film I've seen him in, and it's instantly noteworthy how closely he resembles his father, Denzel. In the way he carries himself, and in his vocal timbre, the likeness is unmistakable. One hardly wishes to emphasize this point when speaking more directly to a film, but it's a worthwhile point of comparison since 'Beckett' feels in no small part like a classic Denzel vehicle - and John David handles the part most capably.If somewhat familiar, the twists in the plot are suitably exciting. The writing is generally fine, though connections between A and B are sometimes specious. Scenes are orchestrated well, especially more action-oriented moments, even if there's nothing specifically remarkable about the technical craft. For the most part the roles are somewhat strictly defined for the cast, but everyone embodies their characters well, helping to bring the picture to life. I do appreciate the original music of composer Ryuichi Sakamoto, ably building and maintaining suspense with a largely minimalist score.It doesn't feel like there's a great deal more to be said without discussing plot points. This is enjoyable, satisfying, and reasonably sound in its build, even though it doesn't necessarily stand out among similar films. I'm not sure I'd say one should go out of their way to watch it, but to come across 'Beckett,' it's a thriller that's an okay watch if you're not hyper-discerning in your selections."

So, the makers respect the action genre in a sort of ultra-pure way. Beckett is also very Hitchcockian in its plot (only on paper) but it's nowhere as thrilling as any of Hitchcock's works. John David Washington is still very green when it comes to the emotional scenes, while Alicia Vikander leaves a greater impact even though she's hardly in the film. A sense of urgency is lacking in many supposedly 'thrilling' scenes. A number of scenes feel a tad stretched out. The Greek locales, however, are just too beautiful to look at. Maybe, they deserved a better structured, less derivative action flick to represent them? Overall, a strictly serviceable effort."

This is a common problem with Netfix movies I've noticed. Just because we are watching these movies in the comfort of our own homes doesn't mean the runtime can overstay its welcome. A thriller should be 1h30m. Everyone knows that. Twenty extra minutes can be an eternity.Even the title is stupid.I can tell them how to cut out ten minutes: lose the first ten minutes of the guy and his wife. We know from the trailer that she dies in a car accident, so start after that. We don't need to see him killing his own wife by driving while sleeping.Some truly awful action scenes, but more than anything, this was just a complete mess. Hire a competent writer would be my recommendation. This made almost no sense."

It seriously isn't.Character's personality and acting were not needed for the director's objective. No idea about plot.

","Granted, I haven't had the opportunity to watch the 2015 Russian horror movie "Queen of Spades: The Dark Rite" (aka "Pikovaya dama. Chyornyy obryad"), upon which this 2021 horror movie "Queen of Spades" apparently is based. So I have no idea how much of this 2021 movie is a copy-paste job or if they actually changed the storyline in some way.Regardless, as I had the opportunity to sit down and watch this 2021 horror movie from writers John Ainslie and Patrick White, of course I did so, as it was a horror movie that I hadn't already seen. However, being unfamiliar with this movie and both the 2015 movie, then I had no idea what I was in for here. So I had no expectations to "Queen of Spades" as I sat down to watch it.Sure, this movie's cover was actually interesting enough, but sadly the cover turned out to be the best feature of the entire movie. Yeah, trust me, "Queen of Spades" was that boring and that uneventful. So it was quite the ordeal to sit through this snoozefest of a movie."Queen of Spades" utterly failed to interest me, much less entertain me. And as for this being a horror movie, well that was stretching the term horror. Sure, if you are fresh off the boat and "Queen of Spades" is your first horror movie ever, I am sure there is something scary here. But if you have seen just a handful of horror movies ever, then "Queen of Spades" falls terribly short of being scary or even entertaining.The acting in the movie was lukewarm, just as the storyline was, so you will not be finding yourself in for a grandiose treat in terms of acting performances here. But I doubt it was the actors and actresses that put on these rigid and wooden performances. I am sure that they were effectively held back by an inferior and subpar script, dialogue and a total lack of proper character development.The character gallery in the movie was every bit as interesting and layered as a glass of water. Talk about having a collection of pointless characters with horrible dialogue. And that sort of stuff just doesn't make for proper or good entertainment. It amazes me that stuff like this actually happens in movies. Doesn't someone read through the scripts before filming and raises a hand or a voice?Then there was the Queen of Spades herself. Yeah, let's just leave that alone. It was that bad.If you enjoy horror movies, you need to skip on "Queen of Spades", because this movie simply isn't worth the time, money or effort.My rating of director Patrick White's 2021 horror movie "Queen of Spades" lands on a generous two out of ten stars."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10260844/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," There were some good aspects to it. ","Queen of Spades had me interested, but while I was watching it I kept wondering how much better could this have been if there was a proper budget attached to it. Clearly no special effects, some make-up and the necessarily distorted voice and that is it, the rest, camera work and actors doing their job.So all in all a quite practical movie, with an overused plot, the same development of such productions, but I have to admit the execution was not bad. Not great, not good, but not bad, this is why I rated it 4 stars, cause it had something going for it, just that they took absolutely no chances with this film. At any given point during its runtime, you're able to predict the next 2 even 3 moves that will be soon to come, and the ending itself, I mean come on, one last moment to shine and they didn't even go out with a spark.Queen of Spades is the same movie you've seen during the 80-90s period, so definitely not something to recommend unless you want to hook up on some nostalgia. Again, not the worst of movies, but adds nothing new to the haunting formula.Cheers!"

I didn't even bother finishing this mess. But hey, at least the black/Indian guy didn't die first! He died second lol.Had to come back and edit this review. Having random loud noises does not make for a scary film. If you enter someone's house uninvited you can't just go around tazing them. Gosh these are some super unattractive people, even for low modern standards, making them completely unlikable or relatable. I agree with other reviewers: the mother looks more like the girl's sister and they act more like estranged friends. I honestly thought these kids were supposed to be in college. Where are all the other parents? Where do they live that the schools and apartments look like something you'd see in Europe? There isn't a single redeeming quality of this movie."

Still as far as overdramatic redone versions of foreign films goes it's not the worst .Mum looks barely older than daughter and nearly laughed at girl saying she told police she was babysitting girl who actually looks same age as her .Annoying and pestering strangers online when you do something dumb and trying to blame them for not helping, super irritating.. Not really scary , well maybe if you're a teen who never watches horror movies.. honestly if I hadn't seen the original it would have been a decent movie with a few creepy bits . Worth a watch .Personally the super young pretty mum and model looking teens is a bit of a put off to me, but the younguns probably prefer it that way there's definitely a lot worse movies out there.It looked good , nothing spectacularly original but okay."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10260844/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","2"," Couldn't finish ","I stuck with it as long as I could but ultimately couldn't finish the movie.The entire cast acted like they all took some Benadryl before filming. No chemistry. Low key acting. Morning particularly scary happens. Done up right it might have been a fun watch."
