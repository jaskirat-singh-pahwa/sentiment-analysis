You really get into the movie and its characters and maybe learn things about them, that make them not as likeable (some of them). Of course there seem to be warning signs on one of them - but the depths this goes ... incredible! What I personally liked, was seeing the aftermath of a horrible act and not the horrible act itself - though horrible may be a definition thing for some - what do you consider horrible or just plain morally wrong? Maybe you even think it is justified ... although that would make me question your morals on more than one occasion.As at least another reviewer said though, the ending is quite ... weak. Which is the last impression you have of a movie. What was not disclosed and what I can't tell you either at the moment is at what moment (time wise) you should turn off and make up the rest on your own. I just know that the movie seems to pander to both sides - trying to shock but also appease. It may look good, but you may have issues to totally understand certain things ... especially an out there decision being made by one of the main characters ... way out there, but still in frame! (puns very much intended) - but you may feel different about it of course and think this is the best solution to this ever. Though why the awake(ning) then? Well you can't win them all, now can you?

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10962368/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," Ah blah ","Based on All Things Cease to Appear by Elizabeth Brundage, this movie reminded me equally of Cold Creek Manor and What Lies Beneath, except that it really makes great use of Thomas Cole and the Hudson River School of painters.Catherine Clare (Amanda Seyfried) had a career as an art restorer in Manhattan until her husband George (James Norton) lies his way into a job teaching art history in Chosen, New York. In their new home, Catherine finds an old ring and a Bible with the names of those who had once lived in the house scratched out.Much like the aforementioned Cold Creek Manor, the children of the last tenants come to help fix up the house. Beyond the supernatural feeling of the home, George starts sleeping around and alienating his wife from any relationships that she starts to form.By the end of the film, George has gone from bad husband to pretty much a supervillain, taking the paintings of his dead cousin as his own, attacking anyone who will keep his perfect life from continuing and spitting profanity at anyone near him.But hey! Michael O'Keefe from Caddyshack shows up, as does Karen Allen as his wife. F. Murray Abraham is - as always - dependable. And the ending is pretty wide open to interpretation, as is a scene where Catherine pulls a flesh-colored tadpole out of the sink while she's trying to get her ring out of the drain.Shari Springer Berman and Robert Pulcini have directed several movies together, including The Nanny Diaries, Girl Most Likely and American Splendor.A lot of reviews of this movie have been upset that the film seems to be building to something and just kind of ends. As for me, that was the thing that I really liked. It just gets wild at the end and enters a world where things don't make sense. Then again, I like the ending of The Beyond and my taste is not to be trusted at all."

"," A scare to distract from our horrible pandemic ",""Things that are in heaven are more real than things that are in the world." (Emanuel Swedenborg)When is a horror film not a horror film? When it is about things that go wrong all day, like marriage and education, but are influenced by the past. Based on the novel All Things Cease to Appear by Elizabeth Brundage, Things Heard & Seen is a pleasant scare fest emphasizing the sins of its principal characters, present and past, and the robust life after death.Swedenborg's philosophy (see quote above) that sees a continuation of this life into the next pervades the story, giving it surprising heft. The 18th-century mystic's influence on well-known Hudson Valley landscape painter George Inness, who showed the "reality of the unseen" connecting the "visible upon the invisible" extends the film's creepy conjunction of past, present, and location. The Puritanical motif and Dutch locale accentuate punishment for sins. Ghosts? It's set, after all, in Ichabod Crane country.The strength in this lightly-cliched horror piece is the emphasis directors/writers Shari Springer Berman and Robert Pulcini have given to a virtuous wife/painter, inexplicably bulimic Catherine (Amanda Seyfried), who has sacrificed her art success to move to the Valley with her husband, George (James Norton). He just secured a professorial job at a small college. As a friend comments, the town called "Chosen" (typical horror telegraphing) has "rich horsey weekenders and full-time rednecks."Almost immediately Catherine feels tremors in the house, hears voices, and puts up with bizarre electrical activity. Seems there is a history of wives being murdered well before the current 1980. (Luckily no cell phones means we will not be annoyed by calls that too easily propel plot.)Berman and Pulcini dot the plot with hints about a current bad dude tied to the past as its instrument in the present. Not good for Catherine, whose husband George is preoccupied with his new job and pursuing pretty young co-eds. How he secured this job and keeps it is a commentary on charismatic teachers and harassment that continues to this day in the halls of academe.The film features the shenanigans of the haunted-house's past denizens rather than over-supplying horror fans with the usual motifs and tropes, not a bad thing at all. However, as a commentary on the insidiousness of corrupt marriages and their usual outcomes, Things Heard & Seen is enjoyable. That Catherine is not immune to the downside of infidelity, potentially her own, adds another layer to the complexity of the marriage theme.In a sense it is a low-rent Who's Afraid of Virginial Woolf, where alcohol was the devil, not some bloody ghosts from the 19th century. Yet those ghosts are at the least a contemporary manifestation of the marital disease very real today for the protagonists.All in all, Things Heard & Seen highlights the emerging acclaim of Amanda Seyfried, lately of Oscar-nomination fame, and smart filmmakers' willingness to merge philosophy and art with standard horror entertainment. As we usher out our own pandemic horror, it's fun to be scared virtually.(On Netflix)"

There is a history within the house that follows it around, and it soon becomes clear that there is a ghostly presence in the place. As Catherine becomes closer to handyman Eddie (Alex Neustaedter) and tensions and indiscretions mount between the couple, it all builds to a horrifying conclusion.Out of nowhere, Netflix offers up it's latest offering, a spooky supernatural effort from joint directors Shari Springer Bergman and Robert Pulcini. Originality doesn't seem to be the order of the day, with the contrived, cliched set up of a haunted house. While this never leaves your mind, Bergman and Pulcini's film has far more to contend with than merely this.The two directors have quite lofty ambitions for such a familiar plot line, but wind up with an overlong and overwrought piece of work that desperately tries to be something more, but ends up all convoluted, building up to an incomprehensible ending that many others have struggled to make sense of. Norton and Seyfried create a convincing chemistry as the married young couple whose happy set up is creaking beneath the surface, but trapped within the confines of such unsustainable material, it's all just wasted.It may have been intended as a creative new take on a well trodden story, but it winds up as something best neither seen or heard. **"

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10962368/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," Wrong Path ","Well, I have no news for you - the ending... Anyway, Things Heard & Seen works well as a drama about a failing relationship (fine performances by Amanda and the other actors) and maybe a turn into the direction of a crime/thriller would have worked well, but that touch of mystery and horror added destroys (almost) everything - it does feel very disjointed and rides on the path of stereotypes of that kind of movies.

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10962368/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Didn't need to be a ghost story ","I actually really enjoyed 'Things Heard & Seen' but as I was watching it I kept thinking to myself, why is this a ghost story? The real life characters are interesting and have more than enough depth to carry the story by themselves. The things that they do are interesting, not what's happening to them. I assume it came from a place of wanting to sell the story as a horror movie, but even then the film is very rarely scary.The film is long for the genre coming in slightly over 2 hours. This can be a risk because if your film isn't good then it can feel extremely long and tedious to watch. Luckily 'Things Heard & Seen' is strong enough to justify it and what's more the extra length let's the story develop at a more natural pace. The film isn't afraid to get very dark at times either. There is one particularly brutal scene near the end that I wasn't expecting (even though it was cleverly foreshadowed).If you like a ghost story then there is probably enough of that going on here to keep you interested. If you don't like ghost stories then don't be too put off by that being present here. There's more than enough other stuff going on that you can pretty much just ignore that element and enjoy the rest like I did. I had a good time with 'Things Heard & Seen' and would say it is worth your time."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10962368/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","3"," A Poor Boring Film ","This film made its way to Netflix today and I managed to find two hours spare so I watched it and here is my review for Things Heard and Seen. The premise of the film sees a couple move to The Hudson Valley where things start to unravel and there might even be supernatural forces in play.Main Character Amanda Seyfried and James Norton plays the two leads here and they both do okay jobs. Neither of their characters are particularly interesting but they are clearly two talented performers and they try to make the most out of what they have and that is some pretty good qualities. But you won't care about either of these two characters or there plights as it is just really dull and mundane with very little reason given as to really why these characters are in this situation.Supporting Characters The amazing Rhea Seehorn is here and she is obviously the best part of the film having some great scenes and she is the best character in the film. This is the first thing I have seen her in since watching Better Call Saul and it is great to see that she is still really good here and despite every other part of the film faltering she doesn't for one moment. F. Murray Abraham is in this film and he is decent but his character is a bit all over the place but he is a presence on screen and it is nice to see him here. But the rest of the cast just play these generic characters that offer very little whether it be the young performers or Karen Allen of Indiana Jones fame they are bland.Story This story is absurd and not in a good way. It just doesn't work, despite a few okay performances there is nobody to really latch onto and the whole supernatural element is wasted and feels just like a reason for a wacky ending and to stretch this film to 2 hours long. It has plenty of clichs and the last act in particular is just ridiculous and comes out of nowhere and makes these characters feel more like actors playing roles then real people. Plus the awful ending and you have a pretty terrible plot.Script The script is also bad, the dialogue does nothing to enhance the plot or its characters. It just comes across as mixed convoluted and basic and these two styles just don't mix and make this a nightmare of ideas put into one film.Style The style of the film looks okay, it does a half decent job of showing the small scale of the place that this couple moves too and has some decent camera work and cinematography. But this film is just really boring and its pacing is lacklustre. This film should never been so long and probably could have done away with the whole supernatural aspect and it might have been a slightly better film.Overall Overall, Things Heard & Seen is a poor movie. It just lacks any interest or intrigue, it is too slow and when it does try something shocking it fails at it. Give this one a miss."

The difficulty is that the two overlap rather uncomfortably and seem almost in competition with each other for screen time such that when you become interested in one, it stops and swaps to the other rather jarringly, like 2 separate films. The performances are ok and Norton particularly is good at being a bad guy. Utterly loses it towards the end though making little sense either in the real or spiritual world. Messy."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10962368/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Things about Amanda ","Horror is definitely one of my favorite genres. I find this type of film extremely impactful when done right. From sleepless nights to unforgettable images, I can never get enough of horror. However, just like every other popular genre, it reached a point where studios care more about building franchises set on formulaic screenplays than actually delivering original, creative, unique stories. Netflix isn't known for exceptional horror content, so I was skeptical going into this movie.Things Heard & Seen may hold a generic premise, but Shari Springer Berman and Robert Pulcini are able to add enough substance to make it interesting. Amanda Seyfried (Mank) and James Norton (Little Women) offer two remarkable performances, portraying two distinct characters that somehow ended up together. Both have their own flaws, but the husband is depicted in such a negative manner that it becomes challenging to follow someone so despicable. The main narrative offers a slight twist on the usual ghost story, making it more than just a creepy jumpscare festival, as well as possessing a particularly violent scene that's no short of surprising.Despite the suspenseful atmosphere, the slow pacing drags an overlong film that unfortunately features an underwhelming ending. The beginning of the third act reaches the peak of excitement, boasting attention-grabbing character decisions that will surely raise the entertainment value. Sadly, the mix of feminist themes with the supernatural narrative is far from getting the right balance, ending as yet another horror flick that had everything to be much, much better."

This time she has largely sacrificed her artistic career to move to upstate New York where her husband, James Norton, has been appointed as a professor at a private college. Swedenborg and his teachings feature in the film, and the area where it's set was a seedbed for his followers. The house itself is soon a hotbed of poltergeist and other ghostly activities. Even a seance is held there. Seyfried discovers that the house has a sinister past and her husband is also hiding secrets. Mostly psychological horror but there are several murders and attempted murders including an ax attack. A Gothic haunted house thriller which is overlong at 121 minutes., it might have worked better with 20 minutes shaved off it's running time. Still worth watching though. Written & Directed by Shari Springer Berman and Robert Pucini. On Netflix. 6/10."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10962368/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," When Shinning meet What lies beneath ","Quite Alrite with old movie concept with adding new elements. It's a bit long and horror part not that advanced. But still good with the storyline."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10962368/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," Potential gone to waste ","I didn't know much about this going in. I watched a trailer before it was released, but it didn't impart much. One can't help but notice the names in the cast: Seyfried, Dyer, Abraham, Allen, Urbaniak. I gathered a sense that it's not received well, but that doesn't inherently stop me from checking out a movie.Unfortunately, in this instance, I'm inclined to agree with the naysayers: 'Things heard & seen' isn't a film that one particularly needs to hear, or see.The cast has certainly more than proven themselves elsewhere, and they do what they can, here, with what they are given. But there's simply no subtlety to be found here, neither in the dialogue, nor in the execution of scenes generally. Catherine (Seyfried) sees a book in passing? The camera emphatically focuses on that book, and she picks it up. George (James Norton) has a scene? He's going to be a creep. A scene features a young child? The camera will focus on them in such a way as to play up the trope of spooky children. Characters who shouldn't be flirting, are flirting? They'll be super obvious about it. All this is to say nothing of how characters repeatedly make astoundingly terrible decisions.There are themes and ideas broached in the screenplay that are worth exploring, but they are touched upon here with the same forceful lack of nuance. I'm not familiar with the book 'All things cease to appear,' by Elizabeth Brundage, that this is based on. But Shari Springer Berman and Robert Pulcini, sharing roles as writers and directors, lean extremely hard into that directness, and it's decidedly off-putting.It's not all bad. As one might say about a house, the narrative has good bones; there are some good ideas here. But the plot is awash in such a gross lack of refinement as to blot out what value it may have had. And while fashioning itself a ghost story, the spiritualist element of the story suffers from the same quality - while also mostly vanishing from the screenplay in the second act. I don't particularly like ghost stories as it is - they generally just seem so silly to me - and this hasn't helped their case.I wanted to like this. I like the cast, and I see potential in the threads of the story. But the execution is terribly flawed, and all is for naught. 'Things heard & seen' just isn't very worthwhile."

I'm sure it makes her more relatable to certain audience and even more realistic a person, as a lot of her characteristics are the result of an unhappy relationship, but it doesn't really drive the story on its own.Once the momentum of the story, the house, and the characters start to build, the movie really becomes something else. There seems to be a new trend in movie making, that this story shares, where the story ends and a new story begins. Its not quite the same as having a 4th act or having 2 3-act stories. It's close to having a short sequel in the same movie, and that's definitely what it feels like.This gets a lot of points for being interesting and having a great cast and delivery, but it's just not..."great" as a whole."

Oh yeah? Then who is the stalker in the woods casting spells on photos of your wife? Then, as these things happen, a Ouija board gets involved and the darkness sees out.In "Masha," the titular protagonist is a woman who knows that her magical powers are there and waiting for her grandmother to die and pass them on to her. Despite her inability to find the man she feels will complete her, she soon finds the power -- and the madness -- to do pretty much anything she wants.Although these stories don't seem to be connected, they are at the end, as the film hints that these women are part of a larger universe. Director Pierre Tsigaridis told Horror Obsessive that "I was really influenced by Italian cinema...Italian horror movies in the '70s were criticized by Americans because they didn't follow a typical structure, more visuals over story. In Europe, that was more common."This movie starts off with a bang, featuring a witch devouring a baby, and then doesn't really slow down all that much from there. You can see hints of everything from Suspiria (both versions) and The Beyond to Carrie, Single White Female and Drag Me to Hell in these stories. And the fact that the villain from the first story has an impact on the second excites me for how this series -- I hope it's a series! -- of films grows."

","Netrikann begins with Durga (Nayanthara, who nails the physicality of the character), a CB-CID officer, losing her brother (Sacchin Nachiappan) due to a freak accident, which also leaves her vision-less. Not one to wallow in self-pity, she learns to survive on her own despite her disability. But her biggest test comes when she has to track down a pyschopath (Ajmal Ameer), who kidnaps and tortures women for kinks, and has started to fancy her as a victim.A remake of the 2011 Korean film Blind, Netrikann is a tense, if a bit overlong, thriller that keeps us on the edge of our seats for the most part. Milind Rau not only manages to give his protagonist an emotional arc that makes us sympathise with her, but also establishes the bond between her and the supporting characters - Manikandan (Manikandan, quietly impressive), an earnest but not-so-bright cop and Gautham (Saran, likeable), a delivery boy, who soon becomes the surrogate brother for Durga - very well, so that we care for their safety as well. He also gives us a few nail-biting moments. A sequence that begins on a Metro train, in which the villain stalks Durga and tries to kidnap her, and ends with a thrilling chase leaves us breathless for a few minutes. And given that he has the Lady Superstar as his protagonist, the director gives us a couple of mass moments as well. Nayanthara, who is understated for the most parts, turns on her star wattage to the maximum in these scenes, turning them into whistle-worthy moments.It is hard to not talk about Mysskin's Psycho when discussing Netrikann. That film, too, dealt with a visually challenged protagonist who was after a psycho killer. But while Mysskin's film was a more complex exploration of crime and punishment, Milind Rau is content with giving us a genre thriller - a cat-and-mouse game between a fiesty heroine and a sadistic villain. That isn't necessarily a bad thing. Genre thrillers have their own challenges and Milind Rau navigates them competently. But the other film was also unique. Both the violence in the film and the filmmaking itself felt pure. Here, the violence somehow feels a bit wannabe (the otherwise perfect Ajmal also goes a bit OTT in these portions) and the filmmaking proficient (Girishh's score does the heavy work here) but not more.The film also suffers from a long-drawn-out third act. We get a backstory for the antagonist's sadomasochistic behaviour, one which might even send the wrong signals about people with a particular medical condition. And by the time we see the disabled protagonist manage to escape from the grasp of her stronger opponent for the nth time, the film begins to test the limits of plausibility. But the manner in which the director gives closure to his protagonist's trauma helps him end the film on a satisfying note."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10973118/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," Gory movie, non practical ","Does not deserve an applause. Want to applaud Nayanathara's performance and want to thank her for taking up such roles. Always finds intriguing with her films. Other than this I do not find the film to be well ploted. As always, the police were shown in a helpless situation, always being mocked by the shameless film industry. Too much gory and blood for the general audience. Seemed less practical in many instances."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10973118/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Good movie ","Nayantara is the sole reason I watched this movie. The plot is brilliant but does have loopholes. The character of James could have been developed in a better way. The police were made to look dumb and incompetent. Its a good one time watch."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10973118/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","1"," Horrible ","Nothing justifies the fake high ratings. It's a horrible stupid film.It starts wrong. A police, so called CBI officer, catching her brother with drugs but does not arrest him.Then she becomes blind. I thought she will have some great skills as a blind person. But it's not to be. And here the movie fails. The blind character is totally vulnerable and useless. Unwanted emotions shown which are cringy. The police officer is even worse. Not fit to be a cop. People run and hide but do not close the doors. Forget it. Just do not watch it. It's a horrible film."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10973118/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," Edge of the seat thriller with awesome performances ","Was waiting for this movie to arrive in Hotstar and when it came, fulfilled the expectations. It started off well, slowly picked up the momentum and ended off as well with plenty of nail biting and thrilling scenes along the way. What an outstanding performance by Nayanthara and Ajmal and very strong comeback for him! Some of the comedy scenes and naive acting by Manikandan made some scenes hilarious! Background music and cinematography was also too good. Only reason for 9 stars is too much of violence and some of the scenes could have been avoided."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10973118/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," A Missed Opportunity ","Let me start by saying that Nayanthara is arguably one of the best female superstars who can really pull the audience to watch her. With that being said, this film let her down.I felt like there should have been more subtlety with Nayanthra's character. I think the misstep was when she challenges Ajmal's character and at the end, there was a different performance. If that scene was removed, I think Nayanthara would have come out stronger. Her character was going through an emotionally journey but it almost felt like the second half of the film forgot about it. There needed to be a better character flow and would have made the movie more cohesive.Ajmal's character was a okay. He never got a chance to fully showcase his character. The character got muddled and a hurried explanation towards the end did not do justice. Had the character development been shown earlier, there would have been a better flow.All the supporting actors and actresses were good. Songs were melodious.To conclude, the screenplay could have been more taunt and length shorter."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10973118/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","1"," Lengthy worst movie ","Storyline is so worst and predictable. Dragging the movie without proper story is a minus.

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10973118/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","2"," 80's thriller - Daretoreadme ","14th August 2021, HotstarIt's not easy to be a victim of sexual assault. It's disheartening, depressing and inconsolable; but the way the Tamil cinema approaches this inhumane behavior is always more sexual and lead oriented ever since its origin. We've seen Indian cinema from ancient times where the villain tries to assault a character, rips off the dresses, and it's more like glorifying the act rather than empathizing with the victim.Likewise, Netrikann is another such film which focuses on the Villain's point of view rather than the victims. We see women being tortured, but they show the Villain's expressions, like how he enjoys it. Whenever the antagonist sees the protagonist, the camera angle spawns all over the protagonist, sexualizing her same as the antagonist.Little much value is given to real emotions, and what we see on most of the screen is obviously fake, perfectly tale bended and too predictable and stupid. The dialogues are ear sore. The particular dialogue where the lead conveys that 'a girl shouldn't be judged by her dress' could've been more decent than demeaning.Logic is as usual missing in the whole plot. The antagonist could've been caught easily but to elongate the runtime, he's always on the loose. Considering that it got released in OTT, the runtime of the series is elastic and questionable. The scenes are also repetitive and lack a focus. So much things could have been explored in the film, but leaving all of them in the drain, the director/screen play writer presents us an age old cheesy drama film that goes far below its expectations.Face-palming, Vetrri."

We get that the bad guy is an evil ra*ist, but should that require over 50% of the runtime focussing on torture p**n?Story wise, this is nothing new. Why does every Indian thriller movie make it a point to portray the Doctor as a bad guy lmfao!?Honestly, the movie could have lost an hour of run-time without changing the overall impact of the final product.The only scene i preferred in the entire movie is when Nayanthara gets chased around the first time from the metro station to the mall - it was actually well shot and i was waiting in anticipation over what was going to happen next. Possibly the only way this movie felt like an actual thriller.On the other end of the spectrum, the police interrogation scene is a joke and I don't understand what they were even trying to acheive with that.The discount Brother (Gautham) was actually an interesting character and I'm glad they gave him something to do the whole time.I gave it 5/10 stars and I'm not sure whether it deserves more or less. I guess I'm mad at the lack of originality and the obvious lack of passion in the movie.

The exact participation is exactly why we have two films. One with her own version, and other with her boyfriend's.This will only appeal to Brazilians, because of how famous the entire affair is. It is not particularly interesting as a crime, for fans of the genre. The film focuses on the events that led to it, not the act per se. Which is a good decision, people want to know how they were able to do such a brutal murder, without remorse.The idea of two films is interesting, and though they are very similar (most scenes shot only once), the films should be seen in sequence (the order doesn't matter). They are short, under 90 minutes each.Acting is surprisingly OK, I believe most people expected an exploitation spectacle. It has a lot more dignity than that. Nothing fantastic, but it will be enough for the millions who are curious to understand what is not understandable. I would have liked to see more of the crime, the lack of images leaves a lukewarm sensation. I dont like brutality at all, but you can only "feel" this whole story within a brutality scenario."

Both movies are based on true events that occurred in Brazil on October 31, 2002.I have watched both movies so instead of writing two reviews, I am going to include both movies in one review.The first movie "The Boy Who Killed My Parents" is the retelling of the events leading up to the murders according to Suzane, the daughter of the Richthofen's played by Carla Diaz.Carla claims it was her boyfriend Daniel Cravinhos - (Leonardo Bittencourt) and his brother Christian- (Allan Souza Lima) who planned and carried out the murders.The second movie "The Girl Who Killed Her Parents" is based on the same premise with one difference. In this version, Daniel Cravinhos is retelling his version of the events leading up to the murder of his girlfriend's parents.Suzane Von Richthofen has a little brother Andreas, (Played by Kayan Ceglio) who in both movies was thrown in the middle of the events leading up to the murders. He was used by his sister to help defy the wishes of their parents who did not want Suzane to be with Daniel any more.I am not going to go into any detail as to what actually happened in either of these movies because to speak about one will also give away what happened in the other.These are not on the edge of your seat movies with people screaming and running for their lives.

We wanted to have a look in the investigation and the details of the day of the murder. All we had was another romance story and besides we have to watch two movies to get to a conclusion? I have so many unanswered questions. Did suzane have friends? What did the people on their surrounding say about the crime? Did they have employees? Relatives that had any idea of what was going on? What happens between the day of the murder and their trial date? We dont even see the popular image of all of them (andrea, suzane and daniel) in the funeral?!

Actually, she is not the only one who did bad in the dialogs, making me even more certain that the director didn't know what he was doing. The movies are both boring and repetitive. Of course it should be repetitive since is the same story being told by two people, but they could save us some time to skip the same scenes. The dialogs are unnatural, far from feeling reality while watching. I could see all the time the actress playing instead of the character and I wouldn't recommend this waste of movie to anyone. Such a good idea for a movie based in true facts, great actors and such a terrible outcome. Costume crew, please find her a better wig! Sad sad sad."

One of the most impressive things about the film is the performance of actress Carla Diaz, who plays Suzane. It's clear her talent and how she studied for this role. She's just amazing, she's terrifying when she needs to be, you can see how intense she can be without looking fake, instead you believe 100% in her, until you see the other movie and see a completely different person."

Sadness, joy, disappointment, and wonder."Mike Mills' newest feature film C'mon C'mon follows a radio journalist, Johnny, that embarks on a cross-country trip with his young nephew, Jesse. If you've seen anything by Mike Mills, you know what you're in for. My first of his was 20th Century Women, a film I adore. His district style of making films about ideas and not story either works for you or doesn't. Once he has the idea down, and they're always well thought out ideas, he creates characters from there and they interact with the world around them as is to create a slice of life story. Once again, slice of life either works for you or doesn't. Depends if you want a heightened reality or see the world for how it is everyday. C'mon C'mon takes the idea aspect very literally. Johnny's current project is going around the states and interviewing children and preteens how they see the world and what they want out of it. I do have a Q&A link that I have yet to watch, but I believe Joaquin Phoenix and the crew actually went out and interviewed actual kids. Otherwise the screenplay is that amazing and these kids are masters at acting. The part was talked about in the Q&A so I guess I'll find out. Strewn throughout the film and the entirety of the credits is audio and video recordings of these interviews. It's a really down-to-earth idea that reminds us what we should be looking at when we see our future and the future for the next generation. The screenplay is truly incredible. Yet again, does Mills write in a way that comes off so natural that you don't even know if this is scripted or not. And he directs it so intimately. The use of black and white works well in its favor, capturing the rich tones we usually don't see with the naked eye. We're close to our characters at all times. Everything feels comforting. Even the way he captures each city makes it feel like a wonderful new experience. As usual, he references many texts and songs throughout for us to remember and search for ourselves.Joaquin Phoenix finally won his Oscar for Joker almost two years ago. Personally, I think he got even better with this. Maybe it's me being one on subtle performances, but I felt a genuine human being that has found warmth and struggle in this newfound connection with his nephew. Being with him is cozy and calm, even in the most challenging moments. I think the real standout, though, is Woody Norman. When it comes to child performances, I think he just set a new standard. Not only is he British and you couldn't even tell if you tried, but he manages to embody this character to perfection. He's irritating, lovable, and all of those qualities you see within an eccentric child. His relationship with Johnny will make you laugh (he's absolutely hilarious) and cry at the best of times. Gabby Hofmann plays Viv, Jesse's mother, and though her role may be smaller, she's very good. All of the acting hits in a genuine way where you forget they're acting. This film is incredibly pleasing and has this unexplainable feeling that entranced me. Even in the slower moments and parts that felt insignificant to the plot, I enjoyed them. Every moment is meant to be cherished (yes that sounds like a Hallmark card). The very end, we have a grand monologue from Phoenix. I swear to you, it's one of the most beautiful things ever written. My eyes were dripping with tears and I was holding it together. Then, the last line hit and I just about started sobbing right there. A few other people in the audience lost it. But the screen went to black and the credits rolled. I managed to hold it together, but even half an hour after it was done (and even now), when I think about that moment I could just start crying. That's how you end a movie. C'mon C'mon captures emotion and life around us in a way like no other. I felt incredibly connected to the story and didn't want it to end. I'd love for most everybody to see this and hopefully feel as strongly as I do, because it's a visceral experience that everyone should have."

To be honest though, without him and the brilliant Woody it probably would only get a 1/10 from me.This is a movie that you probably gonna love or hate, but I find it extreamly insignificant and its not even 24h ago that I've seen it and I already forgot 99% of it.If you are a parent you will see this movie with different eyes I think, but I simply could not relate to this movie and its story, or the lack there of.The two leads save this movie from being a complete disaster and this little boy is brilliant, plays on one level with Joaquin and he is only 12 years old (but looks like 8!) - I am 100% sure, that we will see a LOT from him in the future, maybe even a very early Oscar nomination!

Because it's rings true, it's genuine and heartfelt. This has a lot to do with the directing of Nine Antico, the acting mostly of Laetitia Dosch who's first class as the actress friend of the lead who's torn between her dream and real life and then there's Sara Forestier. I didn't count her among the acting cast, because she doesn't really act - she is - Sophie Legal - the heroin of this movie. She's charming and warm and funny and in one word irresistible. One can't help but root for her and we'll simply all stay through the film to see if she does get her way because Sara Forestier makes us care.So, that's about it, not perfect, but very good where it count - where it makes us - the viewers care for the person we see on screen."

When he wakes, he contacts Wolff and the two of them go on a journey of discovery about who Cage was and the meaning of loss among the frouffy super-rich while Cage tries to get his pig back.A movie like this should not yield its secrets easily, but the manner in which Michael Sarnoski hides them is by no one saying anything for a long time, and then dropping information ker-plop. Truth should be hidden in a welter of interesting facts, not husbanded like a miser, until after a long time, some one announces "Here's what I should have told you." Which one character or another says on more than once. Nor are the characters the only ones like that. The movie behaves that way towards the audience, with an air of suspenseful mystery in which Great Truths are revealed, only of course, the audience should have figured them out long ago: Cage's past, why he's that way, why he's stopping at that nice middle-class house, who's behind the the pig-napping, all of these are apparent to anyone who doesn't have to be spoon-fed small doses of information by Nicholas Cage.

I imagine there are things that are not covered. Things that may feel weird while you watch it. You may expect certain things to happen in this movie ... but the movie will not satisfy those needs or even wants. It will follow its own route/road and its own pace ... which is quite slow. A movie called something with Joe that Cage starred in, is one that reminds me mood and pace wise of this. Still way different overall - so I'm not comparing the movies.

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11003218/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," An astonishing and assured debut with a stunner of a Cage turn ","An astonishing and assured debut; Pig may get you into the theater with the veneer of a darker/darker hued John Wick (by way of, hmm, how's about Leave No Trace, that works for me), but it's much more than that suggests. This is a rather devastating and deeply emotional film about loss, of self and others and the toll that takes, and how it shows ultimately much more courage to reach into someone else's soul, especially if it's a person who wronged you, than to go about the usual revenge narrative. I won't say how this happens, but it's a film that earns its tragic countenance and the look of the film itself (as I told my wife on the way home, the color choice almost looks like a truffle).On that level the filmmaker is also rigorous into exploring forgiveness and how painful opening those wounds can be. I don't want to give too much of the experience away, it's a true character piece in a vein we so rarely get with this actor - I'll go ahead and say it, this is on the level with a Leaving Las Vegas or Joe - but what turned this from very good to one of the year's best was the scene where Rob talks to the chef at the restaurant. What a character. And Cage only brings big displays of this person's grief and anger a handful of times; he's now at that stage where he can come into a room and say little and command attention. And the supporting work from Wolff and Arkin et al is also excellent and matches him.In sum: That'll do, Nicolas. That'll do."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11003218/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Interesting and entertaining search for more than just a pig... ","We have waited quite a log time for this, but finally we have a film from Nicolas Cage ("Rob") into which he appears to have put some effort - and it works. He lives in the wilderness with his truffle hunting pig. Remote and isolated, his only contact with the outside world is when he meets his dealer "Amir" (Alex Wolff) who swaps the fungi for essential supplies. When his pig goes missing, "Rob" proves determined and inventive as he tries to track down its whereabouts. As the sub-plots develop, we discover there is substantially more to the character than that of just a porcine detective, and as the relationship between himself and the younger man develops, we learn more about what drove this man to seek his life of solitude. At times poignant, violent, pathetic and entertaining this film is a good showcase for an actor going back to basics - quite literally, and the handsome Wolff proves a decent enough conduit for him to tell us his story. I wasn't mad on the ending, but it is not really what I expected either."

Please don't pay any attention to the reviews rating this movie with the maximum possible rating. Nicholas Cage isn't a bad actor but I think he came to a point where he doesn't care anymore about the script. I wonder if he even reads it? I think if the pay is sufficient enough he'll just do it. So the acting wasn't bad in Pig. Let that be clear. The story on the other hand... a recluse and his foraging truffle pig live far from society, the pig gets stolen and the man wants his pig back. Everybody seems to be afraid of the man, not because he's an expert in martial arts, or because he's a real badass. No, none of that, they're afraid because he's a chef, a very good cook... Do I need to say more? It's so ridiculous you wonder who writes this kind of garbage. But the acting was okay... What wasn't okay were the minute long silent passages where absolutely nothing happens besides the viewer getting bored and/or annoyed. The director wanted to play this smart but to be honest it just backfired as there was nothing smart about that. Nicholas Cage has some really good movies on his palmares, some real bad stinkers too, Pig is between those two categories. In other words not really worth watching."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11003218/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt"," One of the best films and performances of the year. ",""Pig" is a title so unimpressive that you may ignore what is arguably one of the best films of the year. Additionally, Nicolas Cage does his finest work since Leaving Las Vegas, for which he won the Oscar playing a troubled drunkard. Forget his hack work of late-this is his real deal.In Pig, he plays a troubled former top chef (companion piece at this time to the doc Roadrunner: A Film About Anthony Bourdain?), Rob, who has forsaken his domain, Portland, Oregon, and gone into the wilderness with his truffle-hunting, brindle-colored pig, Brandy. When she is kidnapped, he must leave his hideout to find her in the city.In a slowly-distributed exposition, we learn about his culinary influence on Portland and his sorrow at losing his wife. Cage plays him taciturn and gruff, a literate Grizzly Adams, if you will. When he does briefly open up, or unload, on a current chef he knew back in the day, talented writer/director Michael Sarnoski and writer Vanessa Block have him express his belief that people should follow their dream, grasping onto something that has meaning and losing all that distracts from that goal. Well-written apologia, and well-acted.Of course, pursuing his dream of isolation is what he has done until his love of Brandy drives him into the world and his past. Cage plays Rob right, just slow and introverted enough for us to savor the greatness he was and the misanthrope he has become. A talented and philosophical recluse he is.As we eventually see him re-create a gourmet meal from his capacious memory (he forgets neither meals nor those he has served), we verify his greatness and understand his dislike for mankind. The narrative is lean and reasons not always evident, but the truth about what he says of the world is never lost.In the isolation all of us have experienced over the last year and a half, it is enlightening to experience someone else's, which is never totally understood but nonetheless profound and relatable. Don't let anyone tell you nothing happens in Pig, for as in Nomadland, everything is happening. It is about all of us, our successes and failures with our losses of love hurting most of all.

Moreover, a requisite is that the man shouldn't be a nobody, he must be a made man, whose glorious past makes his perverse choice more heroic for our appreciation, Rob is a museum piece, but his name still means something in Portland, a distant legend whose legacy hasn't completely fallen into oblivion."read my full review on my blog: Cinema Omnivore, thanks."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11003218/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," One of the best films of the year. ",""Pig" is a movie that wrong-foots you at every juncture; even the opening moments hint at a totally different film than the one that follows. Is this a period piece, a western like "First Cow" or will it be a thriller with a 'Die Hard' hero, (and in recent years Nicolas Cage has played his fair share of those)? Actually, it's neither although there are elements of both in first-time writer/director Michael Sarnoski's sublime scenario which is an original screenplay of the utmost originality.We first meet Cage living in a kind of forest wilderness, totally cut off from the outside world, except for his one visitor, (he doesn't even have a mobile phone). His 'business' is finding truffles and to this end he has a pig and that one viistor seems to be his only customer, a young hot-shot with a fancy car and a bit of an attitude. And then one night his pig is stolen.Fundamentally, this extraordinary film is about Cage's search for the pig, aided by that young hot-shot but despite an early sequence that might have come from "Fight Club", don't expect a thriller or even an action flic. Slowly we get to know who Cage is or was and our preconceptions fall away. Yes, it's a character piece but it's also a 'foodie' film as well as a film about isolation, loneliness and friendship and neither it nor its superb cast ever puts a foot wrong.Cage has always been a superb actor but with a sometimes unfortunate tendency towards mania. Occasionally this has served him well, ("Raising Arizona", "Peggy Sue Got Married", winning an Oscar in "Leaving Las Vegas"), but this is an entirely insular performance and it's the best thing he's done in years. As the boy who goes along with him, without even knowing who he is, Alex Wolff is also excellent, (he was the son in "Hereditary"). Not a great deal actually happens but Sarnoski holds you in a vice-like grip throughout aided, not just by his cast, but by the beautiful images of cinematographer Patrick Scola and Alexis Grapas and Philip Klein's score. Come Awards Season I have a feeling "Pig" will do very nicely indeed."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11003218/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Great setup, but fell a little short ","The setup to this film has Nicolas Cage playing a broken soul living in the woods outside Portland with his truffle-hunting pig. After the pig is stolen in the night, he goes on a mission to find him, and we gradually come to understand his backstory. While I loved the premise, I'm not sure I ever completely bought into the shadowy world of gourmet food sourcing that Cage's character traipses through using his connections from 15 years before. The bizarre subterranean fight/punishment scene he endures didn't help with that. At its best, he points out deep truths to other characters, like the devastation the next earthquake will bring, or how a chef isn't cooking the pub food he's passionate about, but instead pretentious fare for the upper crust. Unfortunately, the film itself gets a little ponderous and pretentious as it plays out in an unlikely way. At its core there something touching about seeking authenticity amidst pain and loss, and I wish it had explored this a little more, instead of following the mystery."

"," Pig Is Not What You Think It Is Going To Be ","With a setup akin to John Wick and the ever unpredictable Nicolas Cage in the starring role, Pig knows what the viewers would be anticipating going into a story like this and even plays into their expectations during the first half by giving the impression of a revenge-thriller that may unleash & explode at any time, only to dismantle & subvert it completely as it enters its final act.Written & directed by Michael Sarnoski in his directorial debut, the story takes a somber look at loss & love and is more an antidote to revenge stories despite having a similar structure & treading the same path. There is an aura about our protagonist that Sarnoski utilises to feed our presuppositions but the director is more interested in deconstructing the protagonist in a calm, collective & contemplative fashion.Adding to the film's melancholic quality is the serene camerawork, relaxed editing, unhurried pace & intimate score. And then there is Nicolas Cage who leads from the front with a deftly measured, achingly raw & emotionally hefty performance that ranks amongst his best works. His solitude existence, mysterious past & formidable persona creates an aura about him but Cage stays grounded at all times and is finely supported by Alex Wolff & Adam Arkin.Overall, Pig marks a promising debut for Michael Sarnoski and is another masterful showcase of Nicolas Cage's acting range. This film is not what you think it is going to be and while some will be disappointed by the direction it takes, others will find it more than rewarding for exactly the same reason. A quiet, ruminative & existential drama that's rendered with honesty by its debutant director and is single-handedly steered by Cage's understated input, Pig is definitely worth viewing."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11003218/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," Amazing movie gem ","Greetings from Lithuania."Pig" (2021) is without a doubt one of my favorite if not the most favorite movie I've seen this whole year. It was amazing in every possible way and did something rare movies these days does - it made me feel something towards it.The plot of this movie is simple on the surface. The pig is stolen from a man who is living in a forest near town and he goes on a quest to find it. It sounds simple yet during his quest we understand what the man was before. We get the glimpses and understanding of what made him move to forest. We find out the part of industry he was before, his role in it and meet some people from his past.Without getting into details important thing is that there is an idea behind every conversation in this movie. Some of people we meet start to see things different after they speak with a man searching for his pig. And you can't think of a better ending of this story. Yet this is not a happy story and there are no happy endings to it. But the soundtrack at the end was perfect.Performance by Nicolas Cage was the best he did since probably "Adaptation." back in 2002. I loved him in Joe (2013) and i like Nicolas Cage in everything he does - he is a terrific performer no matter the quality of material he is in. "Pig" is a proof that in a right role and given amazing script, Nicolas Cage is one of the best actors in a world and why he is a superstar.Directing, writing by Michael Sarnoski were essential to this movie. This is his first feature and its amazing to see someone pulling something like "Pig" off in his debut. Will definitely look forward to see more from him.Overall, "Pig" is one of the very best movies of 2021. And its probably my favorite one so far. Its a simple story that combines so many things and does them all right. This is also a superb character study movie. I can't recommend this gem any higher."

","Firstly, I will say that Cage will 100% be Oscar nominated for his incredible outstanding performance... he's due for another one. They couldn't have cast anyone better. But also think... if someone else was cast, would this film be as hyped by the critics? I think not.It does have its merits to great filmmaking, especially considering it's from a newb filmmaker; all casting and performances were spot on. Directing and cinematography were great. The sound and score on point. The story concept very original - but it won't be for everyone, and it wasn't for me.I get the whole character study that explores grief, loss and life, but in the way it was told, was very outlandish and nonsense. It doesn't really make you care about anything, except if the pig has turned into bacon. Sure there's metaphors to dissect, but how do you explain a 3-day bloodied face? No water or towels around? If it was my apartment, first thing would be "wash up, you're bloody and you stink". It annoyingly detracts from the message, and that's only one example of "unnecessary nonsense".Then add the ridiculously slow pacing, and some long dragged out and unnecessary scenes, it made the normally very comfortable 92 min runtime feel like almost 3 hours. And it's not like you'll get any real surprise or reward at the end of it all. It's a generous 6/10 from me, all for Cage and his "I'mmm baaaack" performance. Gonna go cook me some pork chops now."

Pig is a dark and melancholic tale and got its merits in acting and cinematography, but for sure is not meant for everyone: at least this time I don't belong to the chosen (few?) ones who are able to spot a genius masterpiece in this work. Still, if you are heavily interested in the works of Nicolas Cage and you like unusual movies, you may give this one a try."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11003218/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," Nicholas Cage is looking for his lost pig....yawn... ","Beware: former Nicholas Cage ACTION fans should avoid this movie. Definitely. Infinitely.The story: Nicholas Cage is a recluse who lives in the forrest with his dearest pig. The pig gets stolen. Now he is looking for his pig.The bad: this movie looks the part with commercial like photography, with many slow motion scenes and beautifully filmed nature scenery. BUT.. this story is going nowhere, it is like watching a snail progress...More bad: there is no real credibility to the story.Not any good? Perhaps only suited for artsy fartsy arthouse movie fans?"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11003218/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," Starts out strong, then loses the plot ","As "Pig" (2021 release; 92 min.) opens, we are introduced to a guy (later revealed as "Rob") who lives in a remote cabin, along with his truffle-finding pig. Once a week, one of Rob's friends stop by with supplies and to pick up the truffes, to be sold to restaurants in Portland, OR. Then one night, two guys break into the cabin and viciously attack Rob and steal the pig... At this point we are 10 min. Into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the debut feature length of writer-director Michael Samoski. And what a debut it is! The movie's initial third is very strong indeed, and helped tremendously by the lead performance of Nicolas Cage. To be honest, I can't recall the last movie that I've seen him in. Cage has become a bit of of a joke in recent (and even not so recent) years, with the days of his towering performances like "Leaving Las Vegas" long behind him. But here, for whatever reason, Cage is fully "on". Alas, the film loses much of its personality when "the search for the pig" becomes a long and strange criss-crossing of Portland, OR scenes. Along the way, I also lost track of who really was who. So in the end, the film starts strong, very strong, and then fizzles out and loses the plot. This film has gotten extensive critical acclaim and that is the main reason why I decided to check it out. I can't quite follow the critics here, to be honest."Pig" was filmed over 2 years ago, but of course its original release date in 202 0was shelved due to COVID-19. The film recently opened at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati. The Monday early evening screening where I saw this at was not attended well (3 people, including myself). If you are a fan of Nicolas Cage or simply are in the mood for an indie film that is miles away from mainstream fare like F9, etc., I'd readily suggest you check it out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11003218/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Mostly grounded, but sometimes bouncing off the walls ","What a bizarre career Nicholas Cage has had. You never know what the man is going to come out with next. He could do a massive blockbuster, or he could do the most ridiculous film a human mind could possibly think up, and somehow make it even more insane than it was initially intended. 'Pig' is probably somewhere in the middle. It's certainly no blockbuster, but it is also about as grounded as you'll ever see a Cage character.'Pig' possesses a very unique style. For a while it will trot along in a very conventional manner, and then out of nowhere a character will be introduced and the film will just go to bizarro-land for a little while. Not in a bad way, just in a "what is happening?" way. Those scenes actually do well to break the film up though, otherwise the tone could easily be a little monotonous.I wasn't quite sure exactly what I was expecting going into 'Pig', all I know is that it wasn't what I got. I think I like what I got more though. It's a surprisingly deep and moving film that has more layers than first meet the eye. I enjoyed this film and would recommend people check it out. 8/10."

He has a truffle hunting pig and lives out in the Oregon wilderness-by himself, of course-and sells his truffles to Alex, who stops by every so often, and turns around and sells them to restaurants in Portland. One night, some people break into Nick's house and steals his pig. From there, he has to get his pig back, and before we go any further, this is not a John Wick action flick. Nick does have one fight scene but it is to get information on the whereabouts of his pig. He does have a few scenes where he does his wigging out thang. Adam plays a rich entrepreneur that may or may not know about Nick's pig.It's rated "R" for language and violence and has a running time of 1 hour & 32 minutes.It's not one that I would buy on DVD but if you are a fan of Nicholas' work, you might enjoy renting it."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11003218/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","1"," How on earth this film have so high rating? Easily the worst film from Nicolas Cage! Too slow, and full of annoying overuse scene! Bored to freaking death! ","This film start with a man "Rob" talking to his pig, and a people "Amir" arrive with his car scene! As turnout, this film is about solving the mystery of who kidnapped Rob's pig! We found out is Amir's father! Entire film full of boring conversation, and annoying overuse scene! Such as, overuse of the staring scene, overuse of the driving scene, overuse of the blackout scene, overuse of the walking scene, overuse of the searching scene, overuse of the eating scene, overuse of the drinking scene, overuse of the arguing scene, overuse of the song playing at the background scene, overuse of the calling names scene, and overuse of the preparing food scene! Make the film unwatchable! At the end, after knowing his beloved pig already dead, Rob playing the cassette! That's it! Completely wasting time to watch!"

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11003218/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," QUIRKY. ","I loved this quirky, heartfelt movie about love, grieving and family. The acting was great especially Nicholas Cage. Very dark, slow moving and a simple story drawn out into a feature length film. Truffle pig gets stolen. He has some idea of who stole it. He goes to the city to get the pig, only to find out the guys that stole the pig accidentally killed it. End of story."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11004566/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," I BELIEVE ","Wow! Going into films like this, you truly never know what to expect. Watching this not only gives a sense of hope and a sense of belonging for up and coming filmmakers, but also gives this sense of warmth somehow. All Nighter always gives good quality and care in what they make, and that shines through here more than ever. Care is the word that best sums up this film for me. Well done!"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11004566/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt"," Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote. "," In a Category All Its Own ","A great blend of dark comedy, mockumentary, and drama. The offbeat humor is perfectly interspersed with moments of tension, and the acting is excellent. Beneath the apparent absurdity of the plot is a running commentary about the nature of belief and alienation. This ultimately leaves viewers with the question of where the line is between reality and our understanding of it -- if there is one at all. The ending is a true Rorschach test. If I have one piece of advice for first-time viewers, it's to go into this movie with an open mind: It doesn't quite fit into any one genre; rather, it is in a category all its own."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11004566/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Solid mockumentary ","I thought this was a very well done mockumentary. Both main characters were very good actors, and Darren was particular memorable as a character. Really enjoyed it and hope you continue to help improve this genre!"

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11004566/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," "HAVE YOU SEEN THIS MAN?" ","There's such a home-made, warm, deliberate subversion of found footage here, anchored by a magnetic performance of its lead actor.Rooted in mythos and mystery as opposed to abject horror. Really enjoyed this."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11006636/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," I want to watch more films like Ivie ","Ivie is a film you can watch sevaral times as you will always explore new details.This film is not only important as it shows how intersectional storytelling works in a deep and entertaining way.This film manages to dive into Ivies life by not only concentrating on one aspect of her daily issues and not only foccusing on her perspective. One always keeps Ivies story in mind , although the cameara is also leaving the protagonist by following the most important persons of her life. So we also get deatails of the people surrounding her. And by this approach I got to know the protagonist even better. We see Ivie redefining her friendship, family, roots and life and the film takes us directly into the story as it is written, filmed, directed, played and edited in a unique way."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11009596/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," Post-apocalyptic legacy ","The scenery feels underdeveloped: the dialogues, the photography and the music aren't enough to depict a believable world.Acting and direction have ups and downs: while in some cases they bring this world alive in others they ruin the scene.Very poignant conclusion to a story a little too slow and simple to become a classic.Not bad but not really good either."
