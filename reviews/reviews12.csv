"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10854954/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," This is what real romance is ","I had the chance to see Rhapsody of Love at The Gold Coast Film Festival screening this weekend and I was in for such a wonderful surprise. This film is what true romance is about and I have not seen a film like this in more than 10 years. I am 68 and an old softy who loves a romantic comedy. Kathy Luu and Damien Sato are both new to me. Both leads were outstanding in this film and you feel their chemistry, love and their journey. For laughs, there are other fun characters - Joy Hopwood (who wrote and directed the film) and Khan Chittenden are like an old Hollywood slapstick pair. The other supporting characters are also excellent actors and I enjoyed their performance and love stories. But the heart of the film really is with the Kathy Luu who is an extraordinary rare actress - her heart and joy lit up every scene for me and I felt very happy leaving the cinema. On the way out, I heard a young man tell his girlfriend "That was a really good movie, I'm so glad we got to see it. I'd go see it again." So would I. Thank you for making this film Joy Hopwood and team, and thank you for screening this Gold Coast Film Festival."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10854954/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Representing contemporary Australia ","It is refreshing to go to the cinema and watch a rom-com with such charm and character, and one that acknowledges and represents contemporary Australia in the storytelling. The story begins with a wedding, and follows the lives and loves of four very different couples. While the couples all face different challenges, their stories come together beautifully in Hopwood's script to present resolutions that are meaningful as well as happy. The movie is billed as the first Asian-Australian rom-com; it is the first Australian movie to have Asian-Australian leads. The challenges are not necessarily unique to Asian-Australians - we see the characters in relatable situations, and are drawn into their stories. I like that the story included a short film competition, the realities of living with anxiety, someone madly trying to finish their PhD and wanting to become a writer, and finding success with dreams of careers in the creative sector. Beautifully written and with great talent, I highly recommend it."

Yet the towering pines, meandering wilderness streams, bright lime green blueberry leaves, and roaring waterfalls are no match for the moonlight shining in the eyes of beautiful Maria. Living with her family on the remote Quebec frontier of over a hundred years ago, Maria has three men under her own irresistible spell. Eutrope is a shy woodsman from a nearby homestead, and Lorenzo is a rich man from the city, but her crush is on the far-ranging and adventurous fur trader Franois. Maria's family, community, and even the forest utilize spells of their own and each exerts pressure on Maria and her suiters to decide their way. When Lorenzo declares to a gathering of frontier folk that "your animals own you," it does not go over very well. There are many currents for Maria to navigate to find happiness and a bright future.While the story of Maria Chapdelaine has been told many times in film, this version is exquisite and radiant, and it truly captures the spirit of the landscape, story, and characters. The cinematography is satisfying on its own with lingering close-ups of lovers glancing at each other in the soft forest light, sleigh rides in deep snow, and the natural light of sun, moon, and fire. There is mostly ambient sounds of running water, wandering winds, and the flute like melodies of thrushes, but music and song are used to good effect as well. The pride that people have in hard work like clearing land and tending to animals, is evident due to the expressive story telling talents of the film makers and writers. The film is a transformative and enthralling experience, not mere pictures on a screen.World premiere seen at the Toronto international film festival. Adapted from classic book of same name by Louis Hemon in 1913. The story is beloved and famous in Quebec. The film is not streaming anywhere yet. The spoken language is French."

Either way, the end of this movie just got less claustrophobic and more confusing, which can't have been the intent.This was directed by Dan Allen (Unhinged), who co-wrote the film with Sam Ashurst, who has also directed a few motion pictures of his own like A Little More Flesh and Needle Drop. I wanted to like this more than I did, but when the brave explorers showed up to a cave with absolutely no real equipment knowing that a people-eating monster could be inside, I kind of stepped back."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10862050/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," An enjoyable if slightly flawed British creature feature ","After her father's death, a woman's friends decide to take her on a trip to a local cave system to check out a rumored discovery he made in the area, but after getting lost in the vast underground caverns they learn his warnings about mysterious beings living in the caves are real and try to get out alive.There was a lot to like about this one. One of the stronger features here is the film's rather enjoyable setup that brings the couples together and sends them into the caves system. Starting off with the group getting together under her father's death and try to lift her spirits despite the obsession with the journal detailing the monsters in the pages, everything here starts off well enough with the inadvertent tension between everyone and how it all plays out. The early adventures hiking into the woods on their way to get there is quite fun as well, featuring enough general eeriness with the unearthly growls and whispers in the wind that none of them can hear or the fumbling of the directions that finally provides a way into the underground tunnels that serve the film quite well. This early set up out in the forest works well at setting the stage for the claustrophobic and genuinely unnerving experience in the caves where this one really gets a lot to like. With the team venturing through mostly unknown and unexplored terrain save for the cryptic clues left behind in the notebook, the scenes of them wandering around lost trying to find their way in the darkness which is truly creepy and chilling when added together with the freak-outs and hysteria that carries throughout the group. With the eerieness punctuated with the lack of noise and trickling water from nearby streams, the moments when it's punctuated by the grotesque growling and slurping sounds of the creatures give the film an immensely creepy experience. That leads into the stellar final half where they discover the race of creatures living there and are then picked off one-by-one. The film has a lot to like with these scenes playing off the darkness of the setting and the confusion of everything rather nicely by having the creatures perform unearthly actions on the group while they're separated from each other. The first attack on the deserter who's trying to leave or the confrontation in the pit where they store victims has a lot to like, while the finale involving her and the rescue squad coming into contact with the creatures has their own fun as the series of brawls and encounters in the darkness comes off pretty well and exciting. As well as the great creature design, these here are what hold this up while this one doesn't have much wrong with it. Among the main drawbacks on display is the low-budget limitations that end up affecting the film, mostly in the use of shaking-camera effects or near-total lack of light to see what's happening. Far too much of this one is spend with the action scenes shot by a camera rattling around the frame, making it quite easy to lose track of what's happening as people go out-of-focus frequently, while the darkness of the caves hides the gore so well it's hard to see any of it. The other factor here is a rather confusing attachment to the killer creatures at the end, where it offers some unexplained details involving how they psychically control prisoners to do their bidding which is never explained how or why it happens leading to some confusing scenes. These are what hold this one back.Rated Unrated/R: Graphic Violence and Graphic Language."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10862050/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","1"," Who cares where it came from... ? ","To be succinct, this movie sucked on a galactic scale. Four idiots go into a subterranean cave system to look for an ostensibly dangerous, man-eating creature. They arm themselves with their cell phones, hard-hats, head lamps, and a ball of yarn. Apparently, the plan was to knit a scarf or something to strangle the monster with.Those are the better facets of the movie.Not only is there some sort of creature in the caves, there are nutsy-cuckoo people that will attack the unwary adventurers, too. Did you ever roll a snowball down a snowy slope and watch it grow as it descends? This movie does that, too. It develops into an avalanche nonsensical excrement. People turn on one another and attack each other for no apparent reason. The main characters make the stupidest, most inane decisions. The only character that I wanted to see survive was the monster, by the end of this turd of a film.From the producer(s) to the director to the screen writer to the editor to the actors, anyone who had anything whatsoever to do with the production and distribution of this movie should be barred from ever making another movie. The end of the movie is supposed to be reminiscent of "The Descent" movies, but falls far, far short of those films.Do yourself a favor and pass on this one. I wish to God Almighty that I had."

Yet the four characters (who already know of the existence of a creature in the cave system by the way; the father of one of them told his daughter and son but, just like most youth of these times they are complete stupid numb-nuts!) go looking for it with no safety equipment, no food & water supplies, no ropes and most importantly, no weapons to protect themselves should they just happen to run into said creature.The director, one Dan Allen, made a clueless drunken stagger at creating a psychological horror thriller that just failed. The creature is the best thing about the film, as it looks very convincing, but there is no background proof, of anything, that pertains to it coming from another planetary distant world.

Even for a low budget film... it's pretty bad. The acting is unimpressive... the plot is nonsensical... the characters are idiotic... and the creature and its abilities are unexplained and erratic.You have characters making truly idiotic choices, which even for a horror movie make absolutely no sense. You have a creature that has mind control abilities... sometimes... when it's convenient... and not others... which feeds on people... sometimes... and other times ignores them completely... None of it makes any real sense.Most of the movie takes place in a dark cave, with little light, and little idea what's actually happening. The insane amount of shaky cam doesn't help at all.The creature looks decent. Honestly it could have been a decent movie if not so horrifically written, as it had an okay concept.

However, the sister and brother won me over fairly quick and I found myself actually interested in the film. As it went on, even though the elements were all too familiar from various caving movies out there, I was still fairly invested in the film. This, I thought, might turn out to be a hidden gem (a low-quality gem, but still a gem.)And then we hit the last half of the movie and things went to pieces. Thing after thing happened that didn't make sense. Some of the logic of reality gaps were atrocious. And the end had me absolutely scratching my head and wondering if they'd really went there.

Four twenty-somethings enter a cave (extremely ill-prepared) looking for proof of a creature. None of them have any training in spelunking and have no real grasp of the potential dangers.Most of the cave is remarkably level. They make no descents (which is lucky because the only cordage they bring along is a ball of yarn). I could swear they were using the slow flow of water at their feet to indicate the way 'down'.The box art reads: 'miles below the earth'. If they're referring to the creature awakening it must have done most of the walking. The story's two park rangers aren't very ranger-like, one of whom looks like she hasn't slept for a week. If they have any official protocols to follow they do a rather poor job of it.The story is rather disjointed, the character development is very poor and I couldn't bring myself to emotionally invest in any of them. It isn't proven that the creature comes from another world. My head is still spinning from trying to sort out the plot.Wounds barely bleed, lost fingers barely slow people down and people trapped in the cave are subsisting on who-knows-what.Unless you are very bored and have absolutely nothing better to do, give this film a hard pass."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10862868/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","2"," For a vampire movie, then "Nest of Vampires" just downright, well, suck... ","Right, well despite the rather low rating that the 2021 movie "Nest of Vampires" had managed to score here on IMDb, I must admit that I still opted to sit down to watch it. Why? Well, because it is a vampire movie, and also because the movie's cover wasn't actually all that bad.But this was one of those times when you just have to take heed and give the movie a wide berth. Yeah, "Nest of Vampires" is exactly as bad as the low rating indicates.For a vampire movie, then writer and director Chris Sanders just didn't manage to deliver a wholesome storyline. There was just nothing overly interesting happening throughout the course of the movie. And the whole atmosphere permeating the movie just didn't have a particular traditional vampire movie feel to it. So it made for a rather mundane movie experience.The storyline here was just boring and rather uneventful. And it didn't really help much that the events taking place in the movie were slow paced and never really proved to be interesting. So it was really difficult to keep focus on the boring things that transpired on the screen. And I have to admit that I gave up on "Nest of Vampires" with just about15 minutes left to watch. By that time I was ready to claw my own eyes out.The acting in "Nest of Vampires" was dubious, so not even having adequate acting performances here could do anything to lift up an otherwise fast sinking movie. Granted, I didn't know any of the actors or actresses in the movie, but it just felt like people weren't pouring their spirits into the performances put on here.Visually then "Nest of Vampires" was a B-movie. The special effects were rather bland. Sure, they worked well enough and as intended, but it just wasn't top notch quality.All in all, "Nest of Vampires" is barely scraping by. And this is not a movie that I would recommend you invest your time, money or effort in.My rating of the 2021 movie "Nest of Vampires" lands on a generous two out of ten stars."

Believe me, there are PLENTY of films out there with the potential to deserve that particular accolade.With such a low budget you have to cut NoV some slack. I thought it was a great achievement for what it cost (really not a lot). Some of the performances were pretty good. Frank Jakeman was a solid presence, and. I thought Hans Hernke was another stand out, bringing a lot to the table. Occasionally scenes would get into the verbal ping-pong of your-line-then-my-line, but on the whole there's a lot of quality for this level of production.Whilst the main actor certainly had presence, the approach of his character didn't quite gel with me. It was more the swagger of Sean Connery as 007, where you half-expect him to get into bed with someone, when perhaps it called more for the avenging Liam Neeson from Taken, where he's desperately trying to track down who'd taken his daughter. I just felt a bit of disconnect with the father / daugher / wife characters. I don't think we even saw them together, so I think there are some tricks the film misses, and some areas where the screw could have really been tightened.For me it was also difficult to keep up with who was who as every scene seemed to introduce a new character. I wasn't always on the ball with the unfolding narrative.There was some good cinematography in this production, refreshing to see a low budget film making the effort to put some real quality into the look of the shots.So, bringing a bit of balance here, overall I'd say this film has a lot going for it. No, it's not perfect, but understanding the limitations of low budget productions, I certainly have a lot of appreciation for it."

With millions of dollars and VFX this would have been one of the best vampire movies I've seen. The directing was above board and even with a some cringe-worthy dialogue at times it is still worth watching. The lead actor playing Kit was fantastic-yes he reminded me of Bond.

I have never watched vampire films before, but this one has me hooked, I look forward to a sequel. I think the plot requires a relatively high IQ to follow it completely, my wife had to pause it once or twice :) The plot is reminiscent of an old film noir called The Maltese Falcon in that it is very layered and almost needs to be studied diligently to keep up, but it is well worth the effort.

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10868922/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," A Strong contender for a 10! ","For first time female Director/Writer, THE INFLUENCER is a very bold attempt to support an almost all female cast and crew. The writer juxtaposes this aspect with the sleazebag character of Justin, all talk and no spine. The weakness of the lone male lead character somehow uniquely manages to gain prominence to draw my attention but still lets me focus on the toughness of the female characters as events unfold. In an instant, a buried but not healed experience in FOUR triggers off such a violent reaction that alters ONE's perfectly orchestrated plan. For a low budget film, the sets, the stunts and the locations are varied enough to keep the interest up. Below all the glitz, the ending is thought provoking. Who doesn't have baggage? Are we all supposed to be doomed for the rest of our lives? What choice would you make? Tempting indeed!Well done, Meghan Weinstein, keep trotting!"

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10868922/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," A Surprise in a Silver Package ","Social media influencer Abbie Rose is a glorious disaster of a person.Covering her exterior with glamor and glitter, she seemingly lives for the camera. Eventually, an embattled major corporation, beset with internal human rights issues and external environmental disregard itself, proposes an offer that she - as an online personality - both despises and desires. On the tentative edge between accepting their lucrative deal and retaining her own arbitrarily-selected life values, Abbie goes all in and accepts the deal.What happens next literally changes her life forever - and to some degree, Abbie herself.This film has many laudible aspects to it. For example, during one critical scene, Abbie delivers a monolog in the form of a culturally-relevant anecdote as the shot gradually creeps in tighter on the character. The focus becomes Abbie's own realization of self; the first sign that, though through trauma, Abbie is capable of redemption.Too, the film's color palette can best be described as contemporary and fabulous. From the wardrobe to the sets, not a detail is overlooked.Also, the actors were believable in their respective roles; Kasia Szarek made me believe that she *was* Abbie Rose. Each of the primary players breathed the air of life into the characters, of course, but equally notable were the brief appearance by skilled actors such as Dylan Wayne Lawrence, channeling the late Tommy Sexton (of "Wonderful Grand Band" and "CODCO" fame) in his role as Abbie's professional contact person.The film's denouement might have left room for further plot resolution (for instance, perhaps an explanation of what drew this highly specific collection of strangers together to play the film's presumed antagonists would have stated the film's theme even more strongly).In the end, this was a masterfully-crafted indie film, and viewed through this lens, "The Influencer" is an engaging story with intriguing, multi-dimensional characters I'd like to have gotten to know a lot better."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10873536/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Great premise but overall, could have been better. ","Ninna Sanihake tells the story of Aditya(Suraj Gowda) & Amruta(Dhanya Ramkumar). The movie chronicles the ups & downs in their relationship.Ninna Sanihake is a good film. However, it could have been far superior. Writer-director Suraj Gowda has given us the first movie in Sandalwood that explores a live-in relationship. The concept is unique but, the plot gets repetitive after a while. The comedic set pieces are more or less great. The action set pieces are unnecessary & simply lengthens the runtime. Suraj Gowda is perfect as Aditya. Dhanya Ramkumar is awesome as Amruta. The chemistry between Suraj & Dhanya is electrifying. Aruna Balraj, Soumya Bhat, Manjunath Hegde & Rajinikanth are excellent in their supporting roles. A special mention for Samanvita Shetty, who is spectacular in her pivotal supporting role. Ninna Sanihake is worth a watch but, keep your expectations reasonably low."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10883302/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","3"," Style over substance. ","The biggest issue of the film is lack of story. They haven't worked on building the character of hero, villain and even female too. It all looks very childish story telling that too taken lot of inspiration from here and there stories of action movies from other industry as well as even style bit of KGF. It's a one time watch, Because of lack of story the film doesn't even have a theme too. For instance think of what is the core of the film it's conveying? Friendship? or ? There is nothing satisfyingly you can prove it is telling a story of something profound. The more the depth of the theme is, and well written the story is, that good the film will be successful. Though fans might like it, but it will be forgotten soon because just fans based films mostly have style given more precedence over content. And even it seems they wasted so much budget on nonsensical things. There is no character depth which got lasting impression. More than spending so much money on style, songs, and hero upliftment, if they spent it on story writing, this could have been a great movie."

","This is a no logic masala movie and one should switch off the logical part of the brain to watch it.Though the story resembles some rajani and other super star movies, there is a bit of freshness in narration and other elements added, but it is mainly to showcase Darshan.There are many scenes which are very superficial. With a small but of change, these can be made more realistic. But no, directors of these genres just concentrate only on build up to the hero. Logic, story and co actors are all forgotten.So many comedy actors and senior actors are limited to only one scene. Even the villains are limited to couple of punchy dialogues and heroine is just an eye candy. Only vinod gets to share a bit of screen space, may be because he is a close friend of director nanda kishore and also darshan. He did good. Though darshan is good, too much of him on each and every frame makes it irritating.The climax fight is just a joke on audiences."

Movie has mass elements like fights, dance, emotional sequence, big star cast and obviously punching dialogues.. movie started off pretty well. But when the movie dwells on to the past of the protagonist movie becomes disappointing. Darshan's acting is not convincing. Everything becomes obvious. Story is full of loop holes.

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10888594/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," Salman Khan spoils another Eid, makes it 4th Crap in a row. Radhe is your most UNWANTED version of 'The Outlaws'. ","Radhe (2021) : Movie Review -Salman Khan is struggling with Eid releases since 2017 as his last huge hit came in 2016 which was also his last good film on Eid. With Tubelight (2017), Race 3 (2018) and Bharat (2019) he made a hat-trick of craps on Eid and that's the main reason why these 3 films couldn't emerge Clean Hits in India. 2020 went without a Eid release but in 2021 he came back again on his favourite festival but unfortunately the streak of bad films continues. Korean crime-action drama The Outlaws was a big hit there and it's a good entertainer even though it doesn't have anything extraordinary. It is a simple film where a cop is set to demolish the drugs racket. It has typical Korean style action and also focuses on regional gangwars. Radhe makes a massy version of it by destroying the simplicity of The Outlaws and then additional factors like unmatched romance, outdated vision and cheap humour takes away all the chances of making a decent flick.Radhe (Salman Khan), is an outrageous cop who doesn't follow any rules is appointed by seniors to stop a harmful drug racket in the City. He claims to clean the city but he's unaware of a new drug dealer Rana (Randeep Hooda) who is an little extra evil kind of guy. Disha Patani plays Diya, a love interest of Radhe and also a sister of Radhe's senior officer Mr. Avinash (Jackie Shroff). The storyline is 90% same as the The Outlaws with exact situations being recreated while the Romance and other entertainment elements are part of additional changes. Actually, these additional factors have destroyed the screenplay because then it had to compromise with the essence of the story. At the same time it tries so many forceful and unconventional theories just to make the film look massy but then it turns into pathetic childish affair.Radhe has a basic story which makes a good sense for youth audience, however, the screenplay forgets to make a speech on it while taking too much care of machoism and hardcore scenics. For instance, the entry scene of Salman. He jumps into the room by breaking the whole big glass, spits a piece of glass on a man but guess what, the in incident happens in silent atmosphere. Can you believe it? Breaking a glass without making any noise?? It doesn't end here, there are at least 10 to 12 scenes in the film which goes on like this without making one percent sense. See, i don't expect an intellectual Cinema like Satyajit Ray, Bimay Roy, Bergman or even massy film like Rajamouli and Rohit Shetty from Salman, I know his and Prabhudeva's limits so i expect a decent film and not a single penny more. I mean he had made good films like Wanted, Dabangg, Sultan and decent/average films like Bodyguard, Ek The Tiger and some more but this is just too degrading. I mean the entire idea of making a commerical entertainer is completely lost.Acting wise, Radhe is a big disaster show. The only guy who has done some Acting is Randeep Hooda, rest all are hideous. Radhe is somehow lifted by Action scenes coming at right time and Salman Khan- The Superstar but downgraded by Salman Khan-An Actor. He is so absurd at so many occasions. Disha Patani and Jackie Shroff looks totally clueless throughout the film. Prabhu Deva's B Grade direction and outdated vision are the two big reasons why Radhe fails to make a decent version of a good flick. The time has come to quit direction, I don't think he will ever be able to make fantastic mass films like Wanted and Rowdy Rathore (both are simply copy-pasted) in future and anyhow continue using the same methods he used for these two films won't save him for sure. Overall, Radhe has little fun here and there but more boredom. It's nothing but a Race 3 version set in Cops World.RATING - 4/10*"

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10888594/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," Salman show all the way.. ","Radhe review :In this Corona induced lockdown, I caught up on some of the old '80s Hindi films which I had missed then. Most of these actioners would invariably have Dharmendra or Mithun Chakraborty fighting out the villains for reason no one cared for. The plot didn't matter here; the hero did. Radhe is exactly that film. Only it has the present day superstar Salman Khan in place of Dharam or Mithunda, and just like them, bhai pulls off the non-existent script entirely on his shoulders.Making a superhero like entry smashing right through glass shards, Salman plays to the gallery completely bashing up a dozen bozos and mouthing lines to please his fan base. Breaking the fourth wall, he even wishes them Eid Mubarak!! He is Radhe (obviously!!!), an encounter specialist cop - a character carried forward from his own hit Wanted (2009) - who is out to clean Mumbai city from the drug menace penetrated by an unknown outsider (Randeep Hooda).In between the crash boom bang action, Radhe finds time to flirt with his boss' sister (Disha Patani) and even fool her to believe that he is a wannabe model. "Tumhare liye Bigg Boss theek rahega" says someone as a self reference to Bhai who then looks bemused at the camera. The Disha love angle is the most unconvincing and needless part of this one hour fifty minute movie and shockingly, even Salman didn't seem to be enjoying himself in the romantic shots.On the positive, the songs are zany, choreographed efficiently and merged seamlessly in the narrative. Particularly, the 'Dil De Diya' number is fun to watch with Bhai's trademark grooves and Randeep's moon walk.On the tech front, Mumbai city is captured well looking much quieter and sparse probably shot immediately after last years lockdown. Some of the action sequences are impressive like the washroom fight and the one involving a fire extinguisher. The climactic chopper moments are however a big let down with some really tacky VFX which gives it a '90s videogame wala feel...Pathetic!! The editing is also quite patchy in places with disjointed scenes. Prabhu Deva's direction is strictly average. He doesn't appear to be in control here and even the overall film seems to be hurriedly made and dished out...Of the cast, Jackie Shroff is hopelessly miscast as heroine ka bhai where Disha actually looks like his daughter rather than sister. Randeep is impressive as the main villain. Note his eyes while lusting after a henchman's moll (Ihana Dhillon). Its a super fine performance no doubt!! Marathi actors Siddharth Jadhav and Pravin Tarde get pivotal roles and nail it. On the other hand, Disha Patani has precious little to do as far as acting does. She is a glam doll here but isn't able to strike any notable chemistry with her superstar co-star making their pairing fall flat on its mooh!!Expectedly, Radhe belongs to Salman Khan with the star clearly rising above the routine script and making the otherwise mundane film an imminently watchable fare. This one is better than his last few outings like Tubelight (2017) and Race 3 (2018) but not to the level of Dabangg (2010) and Wanted (2009).Final score : Salman gets a full five but Radhe is sadly Aadhe!!Regards, Sumeet Nadkarni."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10888594/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","1"," You Deserve Better ","Review By Kamal KGood lord, viewers deserve better than this! The directors that make fortunes off commercial cinema, the actors who we've elevated to superstardom, the producers that hold the power to greenlight projects-they all need to do better. This will simply not do.No one's even pretending to act in this sham of a movie. Salman Khan, ageing ungracefully, with a heroine half his age, recycles dialogues from his own movies, takes a lift to 'Galaxy apartments', and looks directly at the screen to wish 'Eid Mubarak'.The story is convoluted and disjointed. When the crime rate goes up in Mumbai and young ones are being lured by the drug mafia, the cops decide to call on Radhe (Salman Khan) who has '97 encounters and 23 transfers' behind him. The tired dialogue explains that he doesn't follow rules but can get the job done. Hearing their plea ("police department ko tumhaari zaroorat hai"), Radhe takes up the job swaggering, scowling and never in a uniform.Jackie Shroff appears as his comical, insecure senior and Disha Patani, a fantastic dancer with sketchy acting skills, can also be seen in a thankless role that insults everyone's intelligence. Women are usually not given their due in director Prabhu Deva's movies, and here too, we see an objectified, air-headed character with no depth or ambitions/interests of her own.After their meet-cute, when Dia (Disha Patani) asks him what he does for a living, the 50-plus Khan replies that he's a struggling model. Of course, she believes him. She helps him with a photoshoot where he is referred to as the 'new boy' and 'cute boy' leading up to the mandatory shirtless scene.'Radhe...' is based on Korean film 'The Outlaws'. Judging from the trailer, the Hindi film has twisted the original's premise beyond recognition. Instead of borrowing from their films, it would be wonderful if our filmmakers could take inspiration from the bold strides taken by South Korean cinema.Not as disastrous as Dabangg 3, this one comes close. Why after that debacle, would the same producer-director team-up for another vanity project is a mystery.Meanwhile the villains have dialogues like 'Minister ko paisa khila diya hai.' Randeep Hooda as the antagonist is a carboard character but his talent shines through anyway.Jackie Shroff's recent film choices are befuddling. After the Hello Charlie where he was in a gorilla costume for most of the movie, this is another odd choice.With decades of superstardom, Salman Khan carries with him the capacity to make a shift in the industry. And yet he chooses to make this. It's disappointing, really.We're living in unprecedented, heartbreaking times. If we are to watch cinema, it has to be the kind that feeds the soul. This movie is depleting and leaves you tired.To the viewers who are ok going through an unbearable movie for a few songs and a couple of Khan's shirtless scenes, I just have this to say- you deserve better."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10888594/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","2"," No Less Than a Torment! ","An official remake of Korean Thriller 'The Outlaws'; "Radhe" which is allegedly a massy 'entertainer' fails to bring forth the entertainment itself! Topsy-turvy narration, cringe-worthy dialogues, and plain atrocities in the name of visual effects ensure this affair to be no less than a torment!There was a time, back in the 2010s; Salman was revitalizing his career with consecutive blockbusters such as Wanted, Dabangg, Kick, etc. And pleading guilty, I took pleasure attending them as a kid. Fast forward to 2021, I have grown up and he's still in a similar spot endeavoring with the same old formulaic approach i.e. PLAY IT SAFE, and remain hopeful that his ardent admirers will follow suit!Salman Sir, I'm afraid to break it to you but things have drastically changed!The revolution this film industry has gone through in recent years concerning Content; calling it a phenomenon would be an understatement! And most of all, viewers too have changed their perceptions during this period of transition.Make no mistake, I'm not the guy who's ill-disposed to 'Masala' movies; In contrast, I do extol what the South Indian film industry comes up with in that context! They produce some of the finest massy projects even to this day but they do so in an appropriate manner!That's plenty of my personal opinions, now let us address the elephant in the room, 'Radhe'. If I were to boil it down in a single sentence, I would describe it as "An awfully executed repetitive piece of garbage that didn't have any clue apropos of its motives and purposes".Merely on a technical basis it's got some style, I'll you give you that. But it's all show and no go! Screenplay lacking in continuity and above all, key developements in the storyline come to pass without any prior build-up ahead of their revelations! And the Music being largely futile as they entirely appears to be forceful inclusions rather than obligatory constituents!Albeit there is a naive incentive about educating the audience about Drugs and the harm and distress it brings upon the people who suffer. But that too felt shoddily lumped together! As there aren't any sincere attempts being made to set up its base! Being used solely as a backdrop for our Main lead to beat up some bad guys! That's it!Defining the performances, Disha Patani is despicably squandered. Simply put, she was extremely irritating. However, Randeep Hooda on the other side did what he could with such prosaic script in hand. He was probably if not the only saving grace in here! Speaking of Salman: well! You know, he's just being himself for the umpteenth time!As we finally arrived at the point of conclusion, I just wanna finish with giving a piece of advice to the creators. There's still time, alter your manifestos and your way of thinking as this type of works do no good for the Fans or the medium of Cinema in general."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10888594/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","2"," These two stars are only for Randeep Hooda ","Sorry Salman Khan, this time I would have given your movie 1 star, but there was Randeep Hooda in the film which was Radhe's only positive point. So thank you for adding Randeep Hooda in the starcast, otherwise I would not have gone past first five minutes of the movie.Salman, your entry scene was just not bearable. I mean WHAT were you thinking? Your body language, dialouge delivery and expressions were so bad. It is as if like you did'nt know how to act or was acting just for the sake of it.For me the biggest letdown was not the movie or the script but it was you. You were the most negative part in the movie. Had it been any other actor, or even a newcommer, this movie could have been a bit watchable.And for Prabhudeva, please stop making fun of yourself. You were my childhood hero, had immense respect for you but you are making some crap movie which you should stop.And for Randeep Hooda, the only positive thing about the movie was Randeep Hooda. So these two stars are only for him.And for script, direction, music - Sorry there wasn't any script in the movie and I fast forward all the songs as they were just crap."

When i saw outlaws, i knew that radhe will not be a shot to shot remake as they will make changes for the Indian audience.Radhe's biggest plus point is its runtime which is surprisingly only 110 minutes. Narration is fast paced and doesn't make you bored. Salman who sleepwalked throughout race 3 and dabangg 3 improves in radhe. Randeep hooda was as expected brilliant. Action scenes were entertaining. Among songs, i liked dil de diya and seetimaar(audio only).Prabhu deva goes back to his wanted days in direction but disappoints in choreography. He doesn't even make a cameo appearnace on screen. It was worst to cast jackie shroff as disha's brother. And the whole film is predictable.On the whole, i enjoyed radhe personally and its far better than race 3 and dabangg 3."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10888594/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","1"," All brawn, no brain! At best a polished, mediocre potboiler! ","Your "Most Wanted Bhai" is here, in your drawing room, waiting to be seen and lauded. Radhe is actually much ado about nothing really. A bad man Rana (Randeep Hooda) is in Mumbai, feeding drugs to the youth, driving them nuts while the deadly chemicals consume them, and Mumbai Police must stop him. Rana has a few henchmen with him all the time, and together, they create mayhem wherever they go. So, Radhe (Salman Khan), suspended from his duties (we don't know why, but gauge it must be for his violent encounter specialisation having gone a notch worse than usual) must be recalled to confront Rana and "clean up" Mumbai again.A cat and mouse chase commences, mostly culminating in mire and more violent clashes, involving scores of baddies and gazillions of props and weapons, but Rana remains elusive to Radhe. After a few face offs and near misses, the two men have the final showdown in a helicopter that obviously had to crash land and blow up so that the hand combat leading to the climax can have the audience drooling for more action.Radhe is at best a mediocre potboiler of a story that has been told a million times since early 1970s by Bollywood about honest cops and dirty rotten drug smugglers, that springs no surprises. It remains immensely predictable and is over the top with poor jokes, puns and gory action. Absolutely no one gets a chance to act - actually, there's neither the need, nor the scope available in the script. Arjun Kanungo (yes, the singer & composer), one of Rana's henchmen did have an opportunity to show some histrionics and he makes an effort, but his role is so minuscule and screen time so limited, that you blink and miss him. Salman Khan and Randeep Hooda do show off a fantastic chemistry yet again, but it remains confined to bloody, unbelievable and repetitive, fiercely fought battles. Disha Patani is at best, wasted. It's sad to see Jackie Shroff in a strange, potentially important role where he has to do things he has never done earlier, like wearing a micro dress and dancing with Salman Khan - the sequence was pitiful. The songs are forgettable, ill placed and spaced, and the music is dreadful. The action admittedly is great and so is the running time of 109 minutes - even that tests your patience as you tend to let your mind wander off. Remember, you were asked to leave your brains behind? No? I am asking you to do so now - please comply!"

The story has multiple continuity issues, it is predictable from the start, none of the twist is surprising and you don't feel any emotion from the start to the end. The story has been poorly written by AC Mugil and Vijay Maurya (also the dialogue writer) and even the so called choreographer turned director Prabhudeva has done a horrible job.The acting is so poor this time. Salman Khan looked good but there were many factors that have let this act down. Disha Patani is terrible to the worse extent (she can only be cast in Calvin Klein Advertisements). Also, Randeep hooda looked very unconvincing with his role this time. All the three villains are not up to the mark. Jackie Shroff was good in comic portions. Loved his scenes with Salman Khan. But, his mini dress scene was horrible. Poor casting by SKF especially Disha Patani. Except, Title Track, the music is total cringe. Poor, Very Very PoorThere is nothing positive in this movie to watch. The climax and the end is very much predictable. Also, the Salman's entry to the fight scene is below par.

This is the target audience for such films.A typical Salman branded film.. It will be loved by fans but the others will dislike it immensely. It has everything for his fans which includes a beautiful heroine, foot stamping music, fights, songs, dances, gravity defying ridiculous stunts. Everything over the top ( pun intended ). Salman does what he has done before in his films. He is Chulbul Pandey once again with a different name.and even uses the same tag line. Disha Patni is ravishing , plays coy and is glamorous in a frothy role. Randeep Huda looks menacing as the villain. Jacky Shroff tries to do some comedy without success.To all critics and others who have panned the film and given it 1-2 out of ten, I have only one question "Didn't you know what to expect in a Salman film where he is a bhai and he is wanted too ?".In any case, irrespective of the criticism, Salman and his producer friends will laugh all the way to the bank."

[+24%] ","Shakti Sounder Rajan's high-concept medical thriller falls flat, even with its USP of a fairly big (animated) talking bear. The VFX for the teddy bear is done quite well, but the writing is absolutely awful. In fact, the teddy bear character is that of a typical "loosu ponnu" with zero intrinsic qualities. Arya plays this invincible, genius loner (with OCD) - a terrible move right from the start, because none of the challenges that the screenplay poses to him really matter. The teddy bear, while neatly animated, is such a boring, uninteresting character that nobody would want to "save", let alone our perfectionist hero.Please don't raise logic-related questions in several scenes as even the writer-director is clear it exists nowhere within this film's universe. No one questions why a giant teddy bear randomly appears everywhere and starts acting like a human? Nope! While Shakti can add Teddy to his list of "firsts" in Tamil cinema (he previously made Miruthan and Tik Tik Tik), the writing in Teddy is clearly the worst among the lot. Simply put, it's un-bear-able!"

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10888824/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," Teddy is watchable for the entertaining teddy bear ","After experimenting with his space film Tik Tik Tik, Sakthi Soundar Rajan steps into Teddy, a medical thriller starring Arya, Sayeesha, and a teddy bear. Well, just like his previous films, Sakthi Soundar Rajan presents us a different concept that hasn't been experimented with in Tamil cinema before. The idea of a teddy coming to life is pretty much interesting and innovative but the execution seems to be a letdown. We are offered many logical loopholes and a not-so-engaging screenplay. From the beginning till the end, Teddy doesn't offer any exciting or thrilling moments. Yes, we have a teddy who can talk, dance, fight and be like a human being but is that enough for a film. Except for the teddy, we don't have anything else to get from the film. We have Arya who is shown as a super-intelligent lonely guy. He is a typical Tamil superhero who is able to solve any problems or find any clues in a fraction of seconds. Unfortunately, his role seems to be flat and doesn't even stand as stronger as the talkative teddy bear. Magizh Thirumeni who plays the main antagonist uses his rough voice to create the menacing antagonist feel but his role doesn't let him be an antagonist. He has very limited screen time and not much scope in the overall narrative. Sakthi Soundar Rajan seems to struggle to identify a proper genre for Teddy. The film starts as a comedy entertainer but just after the interval, it becomes a complete action thriller which slightly confuses the real purpose of the film. Teddy seems to be a better comedy film than an action thriller because the true essence and entertainment of the film were only present in those portions. Teddy reminds me of Naaigal Jakkirathai which was also the director's film. It has the same pattern and a quite similar storyline. A lonely guy's life is changed by a teddy bear. The only thing that differentiates both films would be the teddy bear instead of the dog. The VFX in Teddy is simply satisfying for the limited budget of the film. On the musical front, D. Imman has offered an average album and a not-so-great background score. I personally really loved the song "En Iniya Thanimaye". Thanks to Sid Sriram's beautiful voice. Despite the flaws in Teddy, Sakthi Soundar Rajan has made a film that can satisfy the kids. The idea would definitely reach out well among the kids because they would love to see a teddy who can entertain them. Overall, Teddy is watchable for the entertaining teddy bear."

Arya has completely taken the movie on his shoulders and fighting sequences were very good, although it's not a movie, which can be watched with kids because of too much violence. Second half of the movie was really good and it keeps audience glued to their seats. Another interesting thing is second half of the movie has been shot on Azerbaijan that not too many of us have explored!"

Then started the poor execution. Even there is no such story in the first half, but still the first half was good. There is no grippy screenplay nor story nor the characters arc. Sayeesha(female lead) actually done a guest role throughout the movie. Magizh thirumeni(villian) actually a good director but he had just few scenes and there is no such a great scene for him is disappointing. A scam of organs stealing was the centre point of the film, yet it was never clearly explained. Previous Shakti Soundar Rajan films was far better when comparing to this one. Clearly disappointing.

Tamil cinema's most used organ transplant story with most expected twists and turns. Mix of Yaan, Yennai Arinthal and Sindhubath movies.First half was pretty decent until the point they decide to parcel teddy. From there just complete waste of time.1. The point was to save the girl and the only living part of the girl was that teddy. And they decide to parcel that teddy? 2. Arya decides to buy visa for multiple countries in a short span of time? Really? 3. Chennai to Azerbaijan is around 4000kms. That too was travelled by ship. Should take at least days to travel. But, The Teddy's phone charge is intact during the travel time. How? and After getting out from the box in Azerbaijan, Teddy could able to take photos of the surroundings, truck licence plate. Seriously?Teddy after waking up says it seems 15-20 hours i was travelling, but it should be days.4. In climax, operation starts before Arya enters the building but nothing happened until the fight gets over 5. Arya comes into operation theater and says 'this is illegal operation' and everyone stopped the operation. Oh come on. 6. Sayeesha came from Azerbaijan to Chennai and no one said Arya helped to get her back? She just appeared like a magic? 7. Arya goes into control room says remove this area, that area, this hospital and whole Azerbaijan control room listens to it. Says 'okay sir'. Karunakaran says he is a TamilNadu police. Wtf..? So much logic less crap scenes.Shakti Soundar Rajan and Magizh Thirumeni joined hands but not even 1 single brilliant scene in movie.Highly disappointed."

"," Bhoomi On Disney+ Hotstar: Jayam Ravi's Underwhelming Drama Reduces A Serious Issue To Inept Comedy ","Bhoomi is Jayam Ravi's 25th film, and it makes you think he is the nicest man in Kollywood. He just can't seem to say no to a script! On the one hand, you see why he took on this project. The writer-director, Lakshman, has given him two hits: Romeo Juliet and Bogan. But on the other hand, you have to wonder if that's enough. This is a painfully literal film. Jayam Ravi's character, here, is an agriculturist: his name, therefore, is Bhoominathan. Had Lakshman made Soorarai Pottru, he'd have named the Suriya character... Akasanathan. You can keep extending this concept unto infinity. You can make a movie about the plight of the man with the cart who irons your clothes. He's down in the dumps because evil corporate dry cleaners have taken away all his business - or at least, the work-from-home scenario has made shirts and trousers redundant. The hero swoops in to save the day. His name? Istrinathan."

","Bhoomi is a film that is loaded of informations about the farmer's issues but not well delivered to the audience. The poor writing drags down the whole film because the overall film seems to be a remake of several Tamil films. Bhoomi is not unique nor interesting at all. It stands as a miserably executed poorly written film. First of all, we get an introduction for the astronaut Bhoominathan which makes us believe that he is a real superhero but the cliched love track that follows this proves it wrong with no logic at all. A lot of illogical ideas are thrown in the overall narrative of the film which ruins the quality of the film. Speaking about the romantic track, was that it really necessary ? I felt that it was totally out of track. Then, after a romantic song, we come to the main purpose of the film which is a 2 hours of lecture about the issues faced by the farmers. I just want to say that this film doesn't impress me because I feel that the social message was just thrown to me through countless dialogues. We have a cat and mouse game in between the hero and the villain but was it really worth it. Just think about it. Unlike his previous rom-com Romeo Juliet and the fantasy thriller Bogan, director Lakshman has tried to make a strong social issue based film which is, unfortunately, let down by a not so interesting filmmaking. We have some songs that are placed here and there and a background score that gives some intensity to some of the scenes in the later half of the film. The strong and intense performance of Jayam Ravi (in his 25th film) doesn't save this film at all because he is the only one who is lifting the whole film on his own shoulders. We don't have anyone else creating an impact or even keeping the narrative interesting. Overall, Bhoomi fails miserably in its attempt to convey the social message that it's intended to."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10895556/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","3"," Phooski bomb!! ","Rashmi Rocket review :A lady judge admonishes a lawyer in one scene; "Tum Hindi filmein bahot dekhte ho kya!! Itna drama nahi hota hai asli court mein." So very true for Rashmi Rocket. A film meant to chronicle the rise and fall and subsequent rise of ace runner Rashmi who is banned after a failed testosterone test.The story held promise but the execution sucks...and it sucks badly. How can you possibly explain a lead (Taapsee Pannu) supposed to be a running champ but without a single scene where she is actually shown running like an athlete. Taapsee seems to be jogging rather than running on the track. Clearly, the actor hasn't worked hard on her character at all and still seems to be stuck in 'Thappad' (2020) mode looking sad, pensive and worn out...Not done at all!! Compare this to Farhan Akhtar's intensity and josh in Bhaag Milkha Bhaag (2013) or Fatima Sana Shaikh's vigour in Dangal (2016) and you will understand how hollow Taapsee's performance is in Rashmi Rocket!!She is not entirely to blame. The screenplay just doesn't offer her ample opportunity with the entire second half dedicated to a courtroom drama where Abhishek Banerjee and Varun Badola take charge as the two opponent lawyers. Rashmi Rocket fizzles out long before it reaches the climax. And Madame Taapsee seems to be losing her mojo getting repetitive and monotonous with every new release. I still have hope though!!Regards, Sumeet Nadkarni."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10895556/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Let's stand for justice, equality and sensitivity ","Rashmi Veera (Taapsee Pannu) has a natural talent, she sprints like a rocket soaring. She gets noticed by an army trainer, Major Gagan Thakur (Priyanshu Paiyuli) on location in Bhuj who inspires her to shed her personal inhibitions and compete at a professional athletic level. Soon, Rashmi shoots to national fame as the fastest sprinter, much to the chagrin of some male decision makers in the Indian Athletic Association and to the envy some of her own compatriots. Having risen like the Phoenix until now, Rashmi is suddenly slapped with utter humiliation as she is subjected to a gender testing which reveals that she has higher level of testosterone in her blood than is permissible under the international code of athletics.All the fame, glory and reputation crash through the ground for Rashmi as the is banned from participating in competitive athletics by the association and she plunges herself into depression. Major Thakur and a lawyer Isheet (Abhishek Banerjee) take it upon themselves to convince Rashmi to fight the injustice meted out to her by the association and draw her out of her self isolation. Initially reluctant, Rashmi agrees to go the whole nine yards and prove that the whole witch hunt has been instigated by a high handed association office bearer who has a significant conflict of interest.Rashmi Rocket is a relevant theme. It is a crusade against the unjust treatment of and discriminatory practices against high performing female athletes, several of whom have either gone into oblivion or lost the battle against an unfair life. It's a sensitive portrayal of courage, determination, empathy, support and love that are pitted against personal interests, rigid rules and unwillingness to change. There are some poignant moments, even though the courtroom drama lacks conviction and reality. Taapsee Pannu has taken up an unconventional role and gives her very best - she is extraordinary. She is ably supported by Priyanshu Paiyuli, Abhishek Banerjee, Akash Khurana, Supriya Pathak and Varun Badola. Rashmi Rocket is content driven, relevant and avoids being preachy, whilst bringing to the table a very pertinent issue of unfair treatment, violation of privacy and dignity of female athletes."

The courtroom drama felt a bit of an exaggeration rather than information.Even though there were few flaws, Rashmi Rocket somehow stays strong and Taapsee makes sure to stay it that way. With few unnecessary scenes, a bit of over the top drama pulled Rashmi Rocket from being a very good movie, although the performance of the lead was commendable.My Rating : 6.5/10."

","Growing up in a small town of Kutch Bhuj, Rashmi (Taapsee Pannu) is a firebrand from the word go. She gets into fights with the boys and is a rebellion at heart. Her dark skin and boyish mannerisms instantly set her apart from the other girls of her age, but beyond all of that the one thing that makes her special, is her ability to sprint like a cheetah. Egged by family members, especially her equally headstrong mother Bhanu Ben (Supriya Pathak), Rashmi goes on to represent India in the Asian Games. All is well, until a gender test abruptly ends her career, breaking her spirit and morale, questioning her very identity as a woman.Unlike other sports dramas, 'Rashmi Rocket' isn't just about that one make or break game in the climax. But still, Nanda Periyasamy's riveting story, Aniruddha Guha's sharp screenplay and Akarsh Khurana's able direction, holds your attention right from the beginning until the end, where the race for justice is played out in a court. 'Rashmi Rocket' is more of a courtroom drama with an intensely important and relevant topic up for debate and one that propels a dialogue. Yet, the film's execution never becomes preachy or overtly patriotic. It does become convenient at times and makes you wonder if the women athletes, who have actually faced prejudice and identity crisis because of their genetic makeup are privileged like the protagonist here. Because in reality, their lives are much darker. Of course, that is an ideal scenario and the film makes a case for how such women deserve a normal course of life and a chance to be heard. Especially, after a mere test not only ends their career but also makes them a subject of mockery and discrimination.Taapsee Pannu once again proves her mettle, embodying Rashmi's persona, physically and mentally. Her effort to celebrate Rashmi's victory and endure her pain, is as real as it gets and the actress doesn't miss the beat when it comes to making us root for her character. Her makeup could have been more believable rather than just showing her a few shades darker.There are a host of character actors each one performing their role to perfection. Priyanshu Painyuli is adorable as the supportive husband, who stands by the love of his life when the odds are firmly against her. Abhishek Banerjee does well as Rashmi's slightly goofy yet determined advocate. Supriya Pilgaonkar is believable as the judge and Mantra is well-cast as the stringent coach of Rashmi's team.Amit Trivedi's music and Kausar Munir lyrics go seamlessly from inspiring to emotional, but the background score in the courtroom scenes sound slightly out of place. The film's scale, though not very grand, does justice to the demands of the screenplay. The all-important racetrack scenes depicting a stadium full of cheering crowds in long shots, come alive with excitement.With powerful performances 'Rashmi Rocket' fires on all cylinders and stays the course of informing, entertaining and educating its audience about an archaic practice that should be left far behind in the race against inequality and bias."

This movie however has a twist which is new , that is the trauma and the stigma faced by a girl sprinter undergoing gender test after superlative performance on the field. (The rules by international Atheletic association state that if the testosterone level in a woman athelete is beyond a particular level in a blood test ,she has to be banned. Many female atheletes have faced this.) The storyline is about a girl ( Tapsee Pannu) who is a fast sprinter, nick named "rocket " In her childhood by her father. Nudged by her mother ( Supriya Pathak ) to enter in competitions, she is soon a champion sprinter of her area, and swiftly reaches the national level. Due to jealousy of her co competitor , bureaucratic politics and due to her winning three races, she soon finds herself being subjected to gender tests against her will. She is subsequently banned for failing gender tests. How she takes the bureaucracy to court, wins and springs back fighting against all odds forms the rest of the film. Additionally, her pregnancy proves her innocence for all to see.The film remains absorbing due to a linear and naturally flowing narrative of Rashmi from her childhood, to a teenager and a married woman. Direction by Akarsh Khurana is admirable. The highlight is of course the acting of Tapsee and she does full justice to the character. She is ably supported by Supriya Pathak who is good as usual as the mother. Worth mentioning is an excellent contribution from Abhishek Banerjee as the lawyer who fights for Tapsee."

","No sports drama or a biopic, but a wonderfully orchestrated movie, towards a single theme of mental impact on women athletes. Won't be naming any actor, as it'll undermine the amazing performances by all the character actors, but kudos for the hard work, put by Taapsee Pannu. This story is worth watching.

Stellar performances. Taapsee is just ok and needs to really focus on her acting skills. Her emotional dialogue delivery is horrible.All in all, this movie is not as bad as the people are projecting it to be. The movie picks up the pace after 40 mins or so."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10895556/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," Gem of a topic, poor execution! ","The topic that this film carries is extremely important and something that the world should witness regarding unfair gender testing in sports. However, you just cannot have a bold topic and call your film a masterpiece or even worth a watch. For that, the execution needs to be spot on too. This is where Rashmi Rocket fails.It seems the film is more interested in getting to the main topic of the film and hence it fast forwards through most of Rashmi's race sequences. In one scene she overtakes Priyanshu Panyuli like an XLR8 or Flash just to justify the name "Rocket" and that is hilarious! The race sequences shown at asian games/state level races are so badly shot that even the commentary in the race seemed boring.When the film comes to the main topic, it does rise up a bit, hence i give it 5 stars. But soon in the courtroom, what was supposed to be a serious topic being discussed, Abhishek Banerjee's character makes it look unintentionally funny and that is not right! Imagine PINK if Big B would have done some unintentionally funny acts in the court..would it seem nice? No na!Overall, a stereotypical sports drama that takes that same age old route and uses the same old cliches to explain the events I mean C'mon I have seen this film "Sardar Udham" just see how Shoojit Sircar there takes a very different route to explain the life events of one man and not the typical way but Rashmi Rocket does take the typical old route hence it is an ordinary film with a bold topic."

Here are the positives and negatives:Performances-i was so glad to see abhishek banerjee in a lawyer's role. He was getting typecasted repeatedly. He has shown his acting capability here. Totally impressed. Priyanshu painyuli lends a much needed stoic and strong quality to this film. He is a hell of a talent. The supporting cast is pretty good specially supriya pathak as the mother. I liked taapsee's performnace. She is a good performer but she needs to reflect upon her choices. There was nothing new from her. But i have full faith on her.Writing-the writing is weak in the first half to be honest. But it gains its pace from the second half with the introduction of abhishek's character. That is the reason for which the film works for me or it would have been a mess totally.Sports montages-in a sports film u need to show the sports portion with full sincerity. But it was half baked literally. Fast forwarded running sequences diminishing the quality of the film. The sense of realism is gone. Taapsee too was looking flatfooted. An athlete cannot run on his/her foot. She needs to be on her toes.Messaging-what cannot be denied is the messaging. The messaging was top notch. The discrimination towards female athletes, making their careers difficult with baseless gender tests, these all have been shown beautifully. The courtroom sequences are a bit filmy but also enjoyable.While rashmi rocket is not a film to be remembered for ages, it is certainly not the one to be bashed completely. See it for the messaging and the performances. I rate it 8 out of 10."

Thanks to Akash Khurana, the director, Abhishek Banerjee, the lawyer and of course the lead , bold and beautiful Tapsee Pannu . Movie starts with the gender bias in sports and hyperandrogenism which confirms the high testosterone level, leads to ban for female athletes.But the best part of the movie is that it features small and most important human relations , the sweet relationship of Rashmi with her mentor and husband played by Priyanshu Painyuli , her confronting but emotional relationship with omnipresent mother Supriya Pathak and her glass partner, the army doctor , played by Akash Khurana himself.A story definitely inspired from the athletes like Dutee Chand and Caster Semenya , both fought battle against ban and won . The only part I found unrealistic is a pregnant woman running on a track, though not a bar , but it's too filmi . Courtroom arguments are in pure conversational mode and would sound interesting to the audience. Amit Trivedi has also chipped in some foot- tapping notes .An out and out watchable movie.

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10895576/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Mimi is exactly a decade late to be called a Path-breaking film but surely provides a new start to Mainstream Bollywood Entertainers as a Worthy Adaptation. ","Mimi (2021) : Movie Review -Marathi Movie 'Mala Aai Vhaychay' (2011) was made exactly a decade ago when Indian Cinema had not experienced any such stories on a taboo subject like Surrogacy. Samruddhi Porey's conviction and non-filmy vision made that film a Path-breaking Classic. However, the range of Marathi Cinema was not that wide accross the Nation and therefore such a great film remained unknown and less watched. With Mimi, Laxman Utekar, himself a marathi man, has provided a larger platform to the same story with enough filmy style additional changes. Mimi may not be that realistic and hard-hitting because of additional changes made in the main character of the film and also because it was a decade late but for someone who has not seen Mala Aai Vhaychay, this one is nothing less than a terrific emotional entertainer.Mimi is a story of Mimi (Kriti Sanon), a beautiful girl and a dancer who dreams to become a bollywood actress. A foreign couple is introduced to her by a Driver (Pankaj Tripathi) who ask her to be a surrogate mother of their child for which she will be awarded Rs. 20 Lacs. Not aware of the importance of motherhood, Mimi agrees for the sake of money and gets pregnant but only to follow unexpected consequences of motherhood. Mimi sees a lot of changes from the original marathi flick as it creates more family friendly atmosphere around the main character. In the original one, we see the Mother literally fighting all alone and she looks realistic as her character is shown in completely rural, uneducated fashion. Here, Mimi looks modern, smart and more confident than her. Rest of the storyline remains same, literally copy paste and may be that's why there is a reason to call it a 'Late Attempt'. The same story 7-8 years ago would have been a sensation.Kriti Sanon who hasn't got out of glamourous roles till date has finally managed to came out of it. Without any doubt, Mimi is her best performance till date. Pankaj Tripathi runs absolute riot. He will make you laugh like never before. His screen space was quite lower in the films he has done before but Mimi finally gives him enough space to showcase his hilarious dialogue delivery throughout the film. Sai Tamhankar is the 3rd best performer in the film whereas rest of the supporting cast is fine with their roles. Music is highly engaging and supportive to the narrative as not a single song looks out of the context or boring. Every song has particular situation and importance of its own. Mimi is 10 minutes longer than expected but otherwise the screenplay is very gripping. Technical aspects are nice with just one or two dull moments with the child but that's okay, it's just a child afterall.Laxman Utekar seemed more matured from his previous film 'Luka Chuppi'. That film wasn't anything fantastic and lacked quality writing too, so it wasn't his fault actually. With Mimi he got a strong script in hands and he has written it too so he knew exactly where the execution can take it. Most importantly he kept that pan-India humour alive. Mala Aai Vhayvhay was a pretty serious film on sensitive issue whereas Mimi is far more funny and hilarious. It hurts the basics of the sensitive story but not that much. Utekar has already made a terrific emotional drama like 'Tapaal' in Marathi so all he needed was a great piece of writing. Luka Chuppi lacked it but not Mimi. He uses all his skills to make this story family friendly and also adds enough commercial values. Overall, a worthy adaptation to a Path-breaking Classic and yet another new ray of hope for mainstream bollywood entertainers who lack socially important subjects.RATING - 6.5/10*"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10895576/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Kriti Sanon Gives Career's Best Performance In This Beautiful Tale Of Motherhood ","Surrogacy is a process where infertile couple and woman (the surrogate) will carry a baby through pregnancy on behalf of a couple and then return the baby to the intended parent(s) once it is born. While only few Bollywood films like Filhaal (2002) and Chori Chori Chupke Chupke (2001) have explored the complex theme, Mimi takes a step ahead with right message and in right direction.Set in the town of Rajasthan, Mimi tells the story of a dancer (Kriti Sanon) who wants to rule the Bollywood one day. Her aspiration takes a different direction when a local cabbie, Bhanu Pratap Panday (Pankaj Tripathi) contacts her to become the surrogate mother to an American couple (Evelyn Edwards and Aidan Whytock) who are desperate to have a baby. Lured by huge sum of money, Mimi readily accepts the offer only to find that her to-be-born child is suffering from down syndrome.Directed by Laxman Utekar (Luka Chuppi), Mimi is based on acclaimed Marathi film 'Mala Aai Vhhaychy!' by Samruoddhi Porey. Mimi opens on a pleasant note with Pankaj Tripathi's typical comic act where he gives his best to convince Mimi to be the surrogate mother for the American couple. Introduction song of Kriti Sanon followed by her interaction with Pankaj Tripathi is sparkling. The movie becomes more interesting when Mimi agrees to carry the baby for the couple followed by a surprise event which shatters her life. The second half is filled with emotional drama followed by a happy ending. The best part of watching Mimi is that it keeps the serious topics of surrogacy entertaining with subtle humor without loosing its sheen. The movie is 133 minutes long but does not give away any chance of losing the focus as the writing helps to keep the right balance between the drama and comedy.While editing takes a back seat, songs composed by maestro A R Rahman are just passable except for Rihaayi De which is beautifully composed. Cinematography is pretty good with natural ambience of Rajasthan which renders vibrant flavor that goes well with Rajasthani tradition. Mimi belongs to Kriti Sanon who has probably given her career's best performance. The gorgeous actress fits it right to the central character and plays it like a boss, expressing with right emotions. Pankaj Triptahi is electrifying as usual. The brilliant actor just gets better with his one-liners and comic acts which brings down the house. I also liked Evelyn Edwards as Summer who plays the role of a desperate mother while Manoj Pahwa, Supriya Pathak and Sai Tamhankar are fine in their respective role.Overall, Mimi has wonderful and offbeat storyline layered with superb performances. Mimi is currently streaming on Netflix and is produced by Maddock Films and Jio Studios."

After the onslaught of underwhelming OTT releases starting with Sadak 2 (2020) right till Toofaan last month, Mimi comes as a welcome break - a film you can sit and enjoy with your entire family. This is a film which would've worked in theatres as well through strong word of mouth though the makers decided to take the OTT route.Adapted from the Marathi film Mala Aai Vhaychay (2011), Mimi revolves around the titular character (Kriti Sanon) who is a Rajasthani dancer with a Bollywood dream. A local driver (Pankaj Tripathi) approaches her to be a surrogate to a foreign couple (Evelyn- Aidan) for a fat amount.Next, Mimi conceives and is in her last stage of pregnancy when the couple run away due to a misunderstanding. The strong willed Mimi keeps the child, raises him as her own son till one day, the couple resurface to claim him.Writer - director Laxman Utekar deserves applause for mixing humour and emotions effectively as well as extracting superlative performances from his entire cast. Kriti Sanon delivers her best performance till date. Pankaj Tripathi is first rate. Sai Tamhankar excels in a non glamorous role. Manoj Pahwa and Supriya Pathak lend solid support. Evelyn Edwards leaves a mighty impression as the firang lady who cannot conceive. Rohan Shankar's zingy dialogues deserve a special mention.The film has a positive feel to it right from Mimi's "never give up" attitude to the Hindu Muslim unity shown between her and Sai Tamhankar's character. In present scenario, such a feel good movie is always welcome. Recommended watch on Netflix/ Jio Cinema!!Regards, Sumeet Nadkarni."

Kriti Sanon is strong and able to carry the film through its tough moments, while Pankaj Tripathi delivers an outstanding performance."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10895576/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," Delightful ","Review By Kamal KJohn and Summer are a couple from the US who are looking for the right Indian woman for surrogacy. Bhanu (Pankaj Tripathi), a taxi driver tries to help the couple in the process.Mimi (Kriti Sanon) is a vivacious young wannabe actress. She dances locally to show her talent. In one such event, the foreign couple takes a liking to her. Bhanu Pratap convinces her to bear a child as it would help her fulfil the Bollywood dream. What happens when the couple leaves Mimi midway? How Mimi deals with the repercussions of surrogacy pregnancy is the basic plot of the movie.Kriti Sanon is perfect for the part of Mimi. It sits perfectly with the image she is building through her choices.The beginning is business as usual for Kriti Sanon playing small-town girl, but things change around the pre-interval mark. The character takes a dramatic turn, and she does well in those portions. The role offers her to explore something different, and she makes the best use of it. Within her short career, Mimi is a game-changer for considering the scope it offers and the way she carries it.The entire first hour of the movie is a delight to watch. The screenplay is smooth and blends the entertainment neatly into it. The casting of Pankaj Tripathi is a masterstroke here. He is in terrific form and carries the movie on his shoulder like a lead.Overall on Such a Topic , This Film Is Well Crafted And Efforts do Testament In The Final Results."

The story is over the top drama, with many eyerolling moments. Many jokes are really not relatable for a western audience, and most setups just dont really make sense. All in all, the high imdb rating is mostly from eastern viewers since I don't see the average joe enjoying this movie, unless you're into the camp bollybood style. But even then, if you're into that stuff there are far better absurd bollywood movies out there.4/10: nah."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10895576/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Not groundbreaking per se, But It's a Heartwarming presentation nonetheless! ","I knew people would be divisive over its portraiture of such delicate topics of social importance. However, just to be clear; I would like to refrain from all these arguments. The reason being, I don't consider myself enough qualified to enunciate anyone's moral compass in regards to what kind of message this film wants to put forward. I can give you my subjective viewpoints, but then again; does it even matter, or should it actually matter anyway?Moving on...This is an insouciant and laid-back presentation targeted at (should not that be hard to guess) everyone; in a literal sense. The makers intended to get the keynotes of this entire execution delivered to as many people as they possibly could. That's naive, coming from them. But, as far as I'm concerned; this could have been so much better if only their pursuance was a little bit more consequential and grounded.Now, don't get me wrong; I was still able to enjoy it for what it's worth.I laughed, I sobbed, got sentimental, and at certain points was enraged too; this was such an emotional roller coaster ride. And for that, the majority of the credits must go to its Writing and particularly to the Dialogues. Yet, I can't help but criticize the frequent tonal shifts. This happened all too often for my taste and I honestly found it to be irksome. In addition to its conflicting innuendos, I do also bear a grudge against its pacing or the lethargic Screenplay, to be precise. Which again I felt sluggish and unduly prolonged.However, the impressive Performances and the enchanting Score (by A. R. Rahman) were the definitive highlights for me. This is undoubtedly Kriti Sanon's career-best personation. Through total commitment and sheer dedication (Kriti gained 15 kg for her role here), She was able to gracefully convey all forms of subtleties in her character arc. On the other hand, Pankaj Tripathi is a natural. He single-handedly carried pretty much all the comedic elements and heightened up their effectuality as well. What a guy!On a finishing note, whilst inextricably linked to the subjects of Adoption, Abortion, Surrogacy; "Mimi" exemplifies a soul-stirring narrative that tugs right at your heartstrings. Helped by an optimistic outlook on numerous aspects that are relevant to our society today. Whether it be Religious Harmony, the Value of Kith & Kin, or the most sacred bond one could ever contemplate i.e. Between a mother and her child."A mother is she who can take the place of all others but whose place no one else can take.""

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10895576/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," Life is a process , not a verdict that transcends the flow of a living system ","What worked: So what makes Mimi a great watch is an almost balanced perspective regarding the dilemma that appears at the last act of the movie. Of course it's an tearjerker at times with the execution but keeping the hopes alive, decoding them, and giving just reasonings for the perspective makes it an alive, scholar and beautiful watch. Rehman keeps the movie much alive with the score and music, an equally great work by the director. It would have felt flat had the performances were less powerful and dull. Kriti gave the best performances so far. Manoj, Pankaj and Supriya excelled very well in their parts making the overall movie a fine watch. I was pleasantly surprised by the screenplay of the movie especially its scope, layers and overall a balanced character portrayal What did not work: There were some rooms for improvements of course but all the melodramas and tearjerkers were equally valid. After-all it's a local movie in the local context. The movie could still have been valid even without some scenes with sentimental values to cut down the runtime.Final verdict: highly recommended."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10895576/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," An out & out Kriti Sanon Film ","Major part of the film's story is understandable from the trailer itself. So no surprises there. With a very good cast and some really good acting by everyone and at just above 2 hours, the film is more of a tearful story than a fun ride.The lead character Mimi, played by Kriti, doesn't have a strong pre-pregnancy story accept for one goal which makes me not so empathetic towards her character. Yes, I do understand her problems later on but the past isn't strong enough.. But everything that happens later, from a story POV, is wonderful except for a hurried climax.I am hooked with the first few lines of the song 'Parama Sundari' yet the song doesn't feel like anything new to my ears. The music is average & is definitely not one of A. R. Rahman's finest. Another thing to note is the song 'Hututu' being so similar to 'Tu bin bataye' from Rang De basanti. It is so similar in it's music that I just can't digest 'Hututu' as a different song and that is really sad. Even some of the BGM is straight from 'Tu bin bataye'. I didn't expect this from A. R. Rahman. There are other music directors who repeat/ remix their (or others') songs but Rahman? I personally haven't found A. R. Rahman creating a masterpiece that even equals his Roja. Roja was his raw talent, his aura his peak. Nothing has come close to it.As for the film in it's entirety, with some good humor here and there, this film is a family film and is definitely worthy of your time."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10895576/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," Decent but gets boring somewhere ","Laxman Utekar is back with another social issue topic - surrogacy. The movie starts off as a light hearted comedy but ends up being an emotional one.Mimi deals with the subject of surrogacy and how the society sees it and all the pros and cons related to this subject. Definately touching this subject is a brave act. But when you are making a film revolving around this topic, there is certain responsibility and that seems missing here.The story looks fresh and important one but its the exeuction that has let the film down. The charcter of Mimi is very underwritten and the way the subject of surrogacy has been dealt with and explained in the film seems hurried.Character of Mimi was very undercooked. Imagine a woman who agrees to become a surrogate mother in lieu of a heavy ammount of money, this is not an easy decision to make and it's not very easy and a cakewalk as shown in the movie. It's all very hurried one, as if director was in hurry to complete the first half of the story.Even the emotional scenes in the later stage of the movie seems hurried one and not pretty convincing.Kirti Sanon as Mimi though does a brilliant job, Pankaj Tripathi as Bhanu is brilliant as usual.Laxman Utekar this time fails to make a convincing story and even the editing was not good as the movie was bit lengthy.Mimi is not a bad film, its decent one actually but gets boring in between and not that convincing.Music by AR Rahman is decent, not like his best work but definately better than other recent songs and music."

A little known drama "Life Express" (2009) too dealt this subject."Mimi" is refreshing, entertaining, witty and at times makes a compelling watch on an emotional level. Kriti Sanon and Pankaj Tripathi (seen together in "Luka Chuppi") give tremendous performances. The drama has twists and last minute alterations, for which the audiences get gripped throughout. However, the film isn't free of flaws. At times the humor feels a bit forced, there are some obvious contrivances, music is average, and the film goes for an overlength. The emotions in the climax fall a bit inadequate and go for a relaxed end. Overall, it makes a decent watch and will probably give it a repeated viewing.Rating: 2.5 stars out of 4."

","Based on acclaimed Marathi film 'Mala Aai Vhhaychy!' by Samruoddhi Porey, Mimi is skilfully adapted by Laxman Utekar. He along with screenwriter Rohan Shankar ensure the Hindi film has its own character and identity while retaining the essence of the original. The infusion of situational comedy may oversimplify surrogacy in the opening portions to extend its reach to the masses.The 25-year-old girl hopes to fulfil her ambition of becoming an actress in Mumbai, by using the enormous money (Rs. 20 Lakhs), promised to her for bearing the child. Things progress as per the ambitious plan of our rebellious protagonist, albeit to a certain point. Life isn't all sunshine and rainbows, after all. A potential health hazard to the unborn child leaves everyone shaken up. Dreams are shattered, until they are not.Mimi offers a light-hearted, yet moving take on surrogacy and its repercussions. It even cleverly steers people to adoption. There's a catch here though. The film is well-intentioned but the adoption segment gets an idyllic approach and not realistic to ensure closure and that can be misleading. There is already a lot of misinformation on the adoption process in our country, and a certain part of the story adds to the cesspool of inaccurate facts. That, being passed off as cinematic liberty is hard to digest.Kriti Sanon marks her arrival as a solid actor who can carry a film on her own. Her eyes speak anger and anguish with a certain calm - a mark of a mature performer. Another actor who co-shoulders the film along with Kriti is the brilliant Pankaj Tripathi. He is as much the hero of the film as Kriti. From referring to potential surrogates as 'MAAL' to relentlessly fighting for Mimi's well-being, Pankaj Tripathi renders yet another outstanding performance. His comic timing and expression of the visible rift between privilege and poverty is compelling. Manoj Pahwa, Supriya Pathak and Sai Tamhankar are effective in their significant roles. Actors playing the American couple- Evelyn Edwards and Aidan Whytock are decent as well. Their characters aren't one dimensional, which is refreshing.A complete family entertainer after long - Mimi picks a relevant topic and turns it into an engaging, empowering and compassionate tale on humanity and motherhood."

While his parents pressure him to focus on earning a scholarship to an elite college, Boogie must find a way to navigate a new girlfriend, high school, on-court rivals and the burden of expectation. In theory this does sound like a good idea. I like the exploration of heritage and navigating through life. The script does have some fine dialogue that motivates this. But as a whole, Boogie is more of a disappointment. I can't really say disappointment since I went into this hardly any knowledge of what it would be about. The beginning sets-up nicely. It felt like it would be a feel-good sort of movie. Everything just seems to go on repeat after a while. Not necessarily in plot but rather characters.The characters are the biggest issue here. I found all of them to be intolerable. There are hardly any good traits to be found. Boogie is a foolish person that only cares about sports. Usually you see change when it comes to character, but I saw little to no change here. I understand some of what he wants, but I just got annoyed by him. The movie is pretty boring since there's not much change. It felt more like I was watching than experiencing. At times I did feel entertained, but then it would fall back into the slump. Once again, the script isn't too bad and has all the right topics, but with the predictability and annoying characters, Boogie becomes something to be forgotten."

How convenient that right after signing he gets a full scholarship? Stupid unrealistic movies like this makes me cringe."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10896398/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Man-to-man fighting ",""Boogie", directed by Eddie Huang, is not a rags to riches story. The filmmaker doesn't posit Zhi Xiang Chin(Taylor Takahashi) as David, when he takes on Monk(Bashar Jackson), the top-rated basketball player in NYC. This is not the 20th century; this is not Rocky Balboa(Sylvester Stallone), a decided underdog, in John G. Avildsen's "Rocky", when he challenges Apollo Creed(Carl Weathers) for the world heavyweight championship. Set in Queens, circa now, the idea of an Asian-American basketball player is not an implausible one as it would have been in the seventies: Lamont Johnson's "One on One", Jack Smight's "Fastbreak", Gilbert Moses' "The Fish That Saved Pittsburgh" were all released around the same time, the latter two comedies. Not a single Asian-American in sight; not even a bench-warmer or team manager. Quite pointedly, at the outset of "Boogie", the filmmaker utilizes a long-standing Far East trope: The Magical Asian who can tell your fortune in Chinatown. Boogie's parents ask the fortune teller(Jessica Huang) about their marriage prospects; their compatibility, while the future basketball star incubates in his mother's womb. The fortune teller doesn't have a mogwai for sale, but then again, nobody asks her. This conversation takes place in 2001. That fateful day in September is never dramatized or spoken about. "Boogie" is not that type of movie. 2001 is significant, because the following year, Yao Ming broke into the NBA and became a global star as the starting center for the Houston Rockets. Zhi Xiang grew up with a role model that Americans from all walks of life could relate to. Generation Z, arguably, represents the first era of Chinese-Americans who didn't have to grow up in the shadow of Bruce Lee.Don't get me wrong. The star of "Fists of Fury" and "Enter the Dragon" was a paragon of cool. But wanting to be Bruce Lee wasn't. "The Last Dragon", directed by Michael Schultz, inadvertently makes this clear. The three Chinese males who work at a fortune cookie company are utilized as comic relief. But for an Asian-American spectator who reads against the grain, he can appreciate that they're not practicing the latest Kung Fu moves outside the factory on their break. They dance; they talk, coopting hip-hop moves and its correlative idiom, jive, specific to African-American culture, in an attempt to distance themselves from their inherent otherness. When Leroy Green(Taimuk) shows up in a classic Wing Chun jacket and conical hat, Johnny Wu(Glenn Eaton), the ringleader, and his pals are confronted with the stereotype they spent half their lives running away from. Leroy's "sifu"(Thomas Ikeda) sent his pupil on a mission to find the "master", who can teach him about "the glow". These working stiffs, unlike the martial arts teacher, have no intention of playing a role in the Bruce Lee movie that unspools in Leroy's head. The master, as it turns out, is a machine that spits out pseudo-profound gibberish on thin, white-stripped paper that passes as wisdom found in the heart of the cookie. The sifu, despite his appearance of being benign, doesn't suffer fools gladly either. He knowingly sent Leroy on a wild goose chase. He too, perhaps, can't tolerate being treated less like a person than an exotic. Chinese-Americans needed a domestic hero, somebody other than a man, worshipped as a minor deity, from across the Pacific who could immobilize all-comers with nunchucks and break wooden boards with punches or kicks. In real life, nobody's hands were lethal weapons.Michael Chang was Rocky Balboa. At seventeen, the American-born Chang from Hoboken, New Jersey upset Ivan Lendl in the 1989 French Open semifinals. Mr. Chin(Perry Yung), Boogie's father, tells his son: "This was the greatest moment in Chinese-American history." Boogie is too young; he doesn't get it, as they watch an old VHS-recording of the history-making tennis match. That's because Boogie didn't have to grow up with the playground bullying that earlier generations of Chinese boys dealt with because of films like "The Last Dragon", and especially, "The Karate Kid". Without spelling it out explicitly, the father calls his son privileged, reprimanding him gently for not showing the proper respect for what Michael Chang's success meant to the community. Tennis, back in the father's day, was still a predominantly achromatic sport. It didn't have the street cred that basketball enjoys. Mr. Chin was a little kid, probably about nine-to-twelve when Chang defeated Stefan Edberg in the finals to claim the French Open title. It was something to brag about when he heard the taunts of his peers on the basketball court. Tennis wasn't enough to offset the specter of Kung Fu. Practicing with his son under moonlight, Mr. Chin holds up a martial arts blocking pad, a vestige of his past Bruce Lee worship, as both protection and provocation tool when Boogie makes his drives toward the basket. Out of the blue, he utters an anachronism, given the time and place; he tells Zhi Xiang that "the idea of a Chinese basketball player is a joke," which is patently false, given the success of the aforementioned Yao Ming and Jeremy Lin. Despite Boogie's success and a father's pride that goes along with it, the misnomer belies sore feelings that persist inside Mr. Chin's medulla oblongata about never getting a fair shake with coaches and players who categorically dismissed him as their athletic equal. The father, by all appearances, taught his son all the fundamentals required to play D1 ball; the proverbial chip off the old block, who must remain content with the consolation prize of living vicariously through his talented son. Not coincidentally, Boogie's team has a second Chinese player on its roster. Arthur(Ming Wu), a scrub from last year's three-win team. After Zhi Xiang describes his teammates as "hot trash" to the coach, word gets back to Mrs. Chin(Pamelyn Chee), Boogie's mother, who agrees with her son's assessment. The husband gets it; he understands that his wife is calling him "hot trash" through circuitous means. Arthur is Mr. Chin's stand-in, a benchwarmer, "picked last". The idea of a Chinese basketball player, even as recently as the eighties, when Boogie's father was coming-of-age, would have been laughed at, still. Bruce Lee's popularity hadn't run its course yet. Midnight showings of "Enter the Dragon" was still an attraction in the grindhouses of New York City, inspiring characters like Sho'nuff(Julius Carry) in "The Last Dragon", to get on stage and anoint himself "The Shogun of Harlem". Out in the real world, however, being Bruce Lee had no real cultural currency.Boogie code-switches. At home, he's Zhi Xiang, fluent in Mandarin, honors his ancestors, and obeys tradition from back in the old country. At dinner, being the youngest, he takes over the duty of tea pouring from his Uncle Jackie(Eddie Huang), without ego, like any earnest son would. At home, he's Rocky-like. "The Italian Stallion" would start the morning by downing five raw eggs before his 4AM run. The raw egg makes a purposeful cameo in "Boogie". Mrs. Chin serves hot noodles. The egg is used to cool the broth. But at school and on the hardwood, he's Apollo Creed; a world-beater. As Boogie, his "stripper name", Zhi Xiang speaks English with an African-American inflection that's as natural as his Mandarin. He wouldn't be caught dead hanging around Arthur. The filmmaker, just like Justin Lin("Better Luck Tomorrow") before him, is out to kill the stereotype of the model minority. By design, his creation disorientates an audience unused to seeing somebody who looks like Zhi Xiang act like any other jock, being crude with the ladies, when he uses a vulgar pick-up line on Eleanor(Taylour Paige) at the gym. He's obnoxious. That's the point. "Don't tell me..." Eleanor confers with Alissa(Alexa Mareka), her best friend. He is. That's new. Whereas in "The Way of the Dragon", directed by the legend himself, Tang Lung(Bruce Lee) lacks the emotional wherewithal to react when an Italian beauty(Malisa Longo) comes on to him in a Rome hotel suite, and similarly, Leroy Green, like Bruce(who is something of a performative eunuch in his brief oeuvre), uses martial arts to overcompensate for his shyness around Laura Charles(Vanity), Boogie can walk and chew gum at the same. In other words, he can score on and off the court."Ever since you were a boy, you've dreamt of being Kung Fu guy," Charles Yu writes, from his 2020 NBA-award winning novel "Interior Chinatown" which follows the acting career of Willis Wu, whose resume includes the ability to play the "disgraced son", "caught between two worlds", and "striving immigrant". Taylor Takahashi, a former California prep star, at various junctures in "Boogie", slips in and out of these historical filmic stereotypes, but Takahashi never plays "generic Asian man". Boogie is the alpha male; the best athlete at a NYC prep school. "Everyone on that team wishes they could be you," Richie(Jorge Lendebourg Jr.), Zhi Xiang's best friend, tells the star player. It's no accident that the school's nickname is the Dragons. In "The Last Dragon", Richie Green(Leo O'Brien), Leroy's younger brother, doesn't want people to know that he's related to a nerd. Purposefully, the filmmaker recycles the name Richie. Of Dominican descent, Boogie's Richie extols his admiration for "The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao", whose titular character is an outcast like Leroy, a comic book and science fiction geek. The author, Junot Diaz, is on record as being a Bruce Lee fan. Being around Zhi Xiang makes Richie feel cool. The filmmaker is, more than likely, aware of the juxtaposition between both Richies.Monk, ironically, comes across as the biggest geek, when he calls Zhi Xiang "little ninja". It's quite possible that Boogie never watched a Bruce Lee film. Why would he? It's been nearly fifty years since Bruce Lee's tragic, unexpected demise at the age of thirty-two.It's ancient Chinese history."

I don't speak Mandarin and I'm white so that doesn't change my perception of the film.I wish that coming of age movies based on the lives of high schoolers would actually cast teens. The main character's girlfriend, in reality, is 30. Pop Smoke was 20. These people are just too old to be playing these characters, which makes them feel much more adult and mature than they'd be in reality.While Eddie Huang, the writer may claim this story is for minorities, I see it more as something poor and lower middle class people of any race can relate to. Struggling to grow up with parents who are stressed due to finances and are looking for their kid to save them from their own mistakes. Parents who live vicariously through their kids because they ruined their own chances to do something big is a lot of pressure on young adults who are trying to navigate so many firsts like jobs, relationships and the beginning of adulthood while trying to be strong for their family.While I don't know how realistic the scenario is that people have a realistic chance to be signed into the Chinese basketball association, I think for this story, it felt plausible.Would recommend."

The writing it bad, the direction is bad. I'm assuming Eddie Huang either has money, or knows people with money, because that's the only way slop like this gets financed. The lead is sullen, almost everyone is unappealing, and there's zero tension. Even the clichd final game lacks any sort of suspense. It's clear that the only reason this got a theatrical release is the pandemic has made theaters desperate for product and better films still want to make some money, so they're waiting. This is filler. Wait for it to show on some streaming service, then skip it."

I especially enjoyed seeing a contemporary Asian narrative (in this case, Chinese) because of their underrepresentation in the media. On the one hand I really liked Boogie's father who was hard and tough on Boogie but was always supportive, despite the challenges he is facing as a father and a husband, while being on parole. I love the support he showed towards his son. However I feel like the rivalry between Monk and Boogie should have been explored better, especially considering how they have both been with the same woman, Boogie's challenges knowing that the one person who he sees as a threat especially in the sport which is mostly his entire livelihood has laid with the person he loves. And also the girlfriend showing her independence and taking the step to make sure that their relationship doesn't fall apart. Monk barely appeared in the story, and could have played more of a prominent role altogether. All of this was filmed months before Pop Smoke passed away, so there is no excuse."

It started off ok, but soon got cheesy and downright terrible. The best scene was when the dad arrived home and caught his wife discussing their son's future with the agent. Now why a wife would invite an agent home like that without anyone there is beyond me. But, at least it was tense. The dynamic between the main character and Black chick was ok. Surprised that he's tuff throughout the movie, then when it came to sex he was insecure lmao I guess it's character development. There was zero tension between the main guy and Pop Smoke. It was just too forced and there was no development for that. I guess it just set up for the cliched basketball game ending where all problems are solved by winning the game. THAT entire sequence was filmed and edited very badly. I actually laughed out loud when, after the coach yelled at the main character for causing problems at their school game, he suddenly showed up and coached at the tournament game. What?? Poo Smoke was pretty much there to look and sound evil, and get extreme closeups of him grilling the camera or something. Hey, I would've hit a fat paycheck to do that too. Eddie Huang you are the man for Fresh Off the Boat and your Bice specials but this could've been way better."

","While for the most part Boogie may seem like a tonally confused, mess of a film, I find it to be more or less saved by its incredible amount of passion, great characters, and the few good actors that portray them. Especially Taylour Paige whose performance is as good if not better than her's in Ma Rainey's Black Bottom. Can't wait for Zola."

I like sports movies in general and movies from and about lots of other cultures. I had two issues with this movie: The actor and actress who played Boogie and Eleanor are 28 and 30 years old and didn't look like H. S. kids at all - not even close. The 2nd issue was with the ending and all the closeups of the eyes, I thought it was overdone."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10896398/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Things I have not seen before.... ","....with Asian actors (at least not very often).The ways the parents got to interact: their longing for a good life, the way the mom wanted to believe in it and the dad knew from the start things would be hard (although a lot of it is his fault).I loved the mom. Her character shined for me. She was this young woman who wanted her marriage to work and wanted everything for her son. She did start to fall for the guy that recruited her son, but she didn't leave her family (despite the violence of her husband). Also, yeah, the mom got angry too and sometimes too personal with the son. I think somehow feels safe with people she can fight with, but it's still sad. The ending of the film goes back to when the parents were more of a unit and dedicated to their son succeeding as a team, but we're not sure if the family will be patched up.I think the son is more successful at love and will be what his mother wants her son to be, at least somewhat. His girlfriend was too good for him sometimes. My sister and I watched this and didn't get why she bothered with him, but it is high school. I'm looking at it with a twenty-eight year old's perspective.I think the acting team was great. The story also didn't end up with perfect people but very grey people. You didn't always know what they were going to do.Lastly, this is one of those movies where the guys fight but they really wanted to be friends the whole time. I think it happens and it's crazy, but friendship is complicated and I personally like those kinds of movies."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10896634/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","3"," Long Story Short ","On his wedding day, Rafe Spall suddenly finds that a year has passed in just a few minutes. This keeps happening and he finds out in snapshots of his life that's he's messed messed most of it up.Whilst this is a fun, albeit not wholly original notion, I never trust comedies that need to deliver everything at breakneck speed. Spall babbles through the whole thing, screaming oh my god, what's happening etc in true Seth Rogen / Will Ferrell delivery mode that his character rarely slows down enough to think. The best and most touching bits are therefore when the brakes are on and he reflects on his position. The support cast are deeply average and overall this was a disappointing, poorly delivered experience where the makers seemingly believed that Spall's panicky delivery was in itself funny, which it isn't."

Snapshot of 10 years in 30 mins is the ground of the story. We are busy for living, ignore the details, miss the precious time with closed ones, I feel is what the writer research many elder life stories. For a middle age man, I can't disagree so much about the blueprint and feel everyone should makes all our regrets controllable whatever it takes. That's not difficult, watch this movie makes you know how things can be done properly. This is not just a comedy but so many life physiology inside."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10896634/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Too Long a Short Story ","Mr Review- Long Story Short. My Rating 6/10It's a shame that this Comedy Romance just doesn't work as it has the bones of something better. There are very few occasions where the Script /story writer , Director and Executive Producer also acts in his own film it's a huge task to achieve successfully. it worked for Charles Chaplain Mel Brooks and Woody Allen they all managed it but they were geniuses . Josh Lawson the creator and Director of this film doesn't manage to pull it off unfortunately and it's certainly not the fault of his cast they are all very good.The plot is simple it's an adult fable about the value of our short time on The Planet, and the consequences of wasting the time we have life and also the value of maintaining relationships and friendships.Teddy , payed by British Actor Rafe Spall (son of Timothy) wakes up the morning after his wedding to discover that every few minutes he's jumping forward to the next year of his life. Rafe Spall is excellent in a very big role as is Zahra Newman as Leanne his bride who each time Teddy jumps forward a year in time we see Leanne becoming more and more disappointed with Teddy's shortcomings and neglect . Noni Hazlehurst as The Stranger has a Cameo appearance and should have been used more ,she seems to wander Eastern Suburbs Cemetery as a Lesbian Witch handing out "The Gift" ,sound unusual ? It is.......I've seen this story done much more effectively in Charles Dickens "Scrooge " same basic plot about ghost appearing in a dream to show the main character the error of his way of life and pointing to the future to show him the consequences if he doesn't see the error of his ways. In fact the final scene is straight out of "Scrooge."I've seen many worse movies than this and it has some lovely moments and good performances. It's creator Josh Lawson was nominated for an Academy Award in 2018 for Best Live Action Short Film ,strangely I was actually thinking while watching "Long Short Story" that it would have made a much better short story movie. Perhaps it should be called "Too Long a Short Story." Is it worth seeing at the Cinema ? perhaps wait till it's streaming it won't be too long."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10896634/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," Oh Ponniechoo's! ","An instant classic! I watched a Aussie movie the other night and I could not make out half of what they said in it. This movie had no subtitles but thankfully their accent was not too thick to understand. I love a good rom/com, they always make you feel good. This movie was great, funny, drama, and a happy ending. Who could ask for more. Spall and Newman are both new names to me but they both brought so much to the table and made this movie perfect! This was a story that has been done time and time again but the way they did it made it original in it's own way. I loved how cute and adorable the little girl was. I will definitely be watching this one again and I am going to recommend to as many ppl as I can."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10896634/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","1"," Fake Positive Reviews Abound for This Awful Movie! ","First let me get this out. It has the LGBT agenda with a mix of other unsavory things. Hence so much positive reviews by the people who never saw it.It's about a man, and on his anniversary, he leaps one year in the future. Sounds like fun? Nope. It's opens strongly, the the leap happens and then boredom ensues. No great plot, just a bunch of scenes that suppose to make people care, but it's been done better before, and I just cringe at the above mentioned.I found it deplorable, and terrible and insulting. NOT recommended. 1 star to 3 stars depending on your tolerance for the boring."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10896634/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Not brilliant, but okay ","Sweet little romantic comedy starring the wonderful Rafe Spall. Not brilliant, it's ok if you have time to kill.The story is basically that a newly married man skips forward a year to each anniversary and sees his life progress.A bit like the premise of 'Click' but nowhere near as touching or engaging."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10896634/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," YOLO! ","YOLO! Is so last year, but you'll hear it a lot in "Long Story Short" and for good reason. The whole plot revolves around living our best life and making every second of every moment count. You Only Live Once! Too many people have lost the art of living in the moment and are instead trapped in a world on their own electronic devices. One of the big bonuses in this Aussie movie is seeing a stalwart of Australian Cinema. TV and Stage, Noni Hazelhurst, who's lived a full life, play The Stranger a Lesbian Sorceress who puts a hex on our male star, Rafe Spall as Teddy. He's a funny, English, workaholic, procrastinator who's deeply in love with Leanne played by Zara Newman. They accidentally snogged on the toll of midnight one New Years Eve and were destined to be together no matter what. But as a wedding present they are given a mysterious tin can gift from The Stranger that rattles and the next thing you know our heroes life flashes forward exactly one year on the happy couples wedding anniversary every few moments. Imagine your ageing, but your partner is going all Dorian Gray on you (ask your parents). Teddy's wife is struggling to cope with his absences and time travel. Fun Fact: Rafe is the son of the legendary actor, Timothy Spall and at age 19 shed many kilos to get better acting roles. His good buddy is played by stand up comedian and "Crazy Rich Asian" star, Ronnie Chieng, who was one of the first people cast for "Long Story Short". His role will have you both laughing and crying tears. The films writer and director,Josh Lawson, appears in a minor but pivotal role as Patrick and does an outstanding job with this production. This is easily one of the best Aussie RomComs of 2021 with shades of the UK picture, "About Time". Time travel seems to be the buzz word in movies at the moment after another Aussie movie, "2067" out now on Netflix and "Synchronic" on the big screen."

He is a wonderful actor...it seems like it comes so naturally he does not appear to be acting at times. I have liked everything I have seen him in and this is no exception.This movie is quite humorous but it also did a tug on my heartstrings. Possibly because I am old enough to have been through it all...not paying attention as the important parts of life float by...I am sure I have made all the mistakes. This would be a great movie for newlyweds to watch; unfortunately, I don't think they would get the full effect as I would not have at a young age."

He pulled off both the comedy and the tragedy of his character with his usual brilliance.Zahra Newman and Ronny Chieng were perfect in their supporting roles, bringing a lot of emotion to the story and their characters.Noni Hazlehurst and Dena Kaplan were both wonderful with strong portrayals of their characters despite having only a few scenes each.Josh Lawson has done a great job with this quirky little film which he wrote and directed and appears in briefly.It was refreshingly nice to see an Aussie made film that never focused on the fact that it was Australian. This really could've been set anywhere, but the NSW coastal setting was still very much appreciated.A solid rom com which tackles the "curse with a lesson" device in its own unique way and succeeds. Highly recommend."

The characters chemistry is perfect and the actors are so good at their roles, Rate Spall, Zahra Newman and Ronny Chieng. This is such a beautiful, funny with emotional film. You won't regret it."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10896634/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","3"," Long Story Short's existentialism is squandered by predictable plotting and safe direction that brings little depth to its ideas. ","On paper, the concept of Long Story Short feels unique and unusually existential for a romantic comedy and there are glimpses of genuine, thoughtful emotion to be found in the film's more dramatic moments. The idea that years of your life could suddenly turn into minutes is terrifying and also heartbreaking since you're getting closer to death and you're missing out on life, yet I can see the comedy in this premise that Long Story Short aims for, and its ambitions have to be admired. It also has a sense of sweetness that, unfortunately, feels too familiar and turns Long Story Short into a frustratingly predictable plot.This film looks and feels generic. There is rarely anything special about the execution, even when we move forward in time, and I could not buy some of the character behaviours at all. There is a lot Long Story Short could've done to bring its premise to mind-blowing complexities, and early on, I considered the film being a potential allegory of mental illness or the search for meaning in life, yet those interpretations don't come to fruition very well. Its message is clear in that you only live once, so you need to make the most out of every second you live in and Long Story Short uses Teddy's (Rafe Spall) storyline to show the horrors of losing time, yet its messaging borders on preachy and eventually tiring.Undoubtedly, the acting is the best aspect of Long Story Short. Rafe Spall and Zahra Newman deliver strong performances and their chemistry brought their roles to life. As uninteresting as their characters were, I could believe they were a couple. The supporting cast also give out solid performances and Noni Hazlehurst, a legendary veteran actress in Australia, is phenomenal with the screentime she gets. When Hazlehurst has her monologue towards the end, I found her characterisation more intriguing than the others. In that regard, I wasn't invested in the character work, despite how likeable the performances were, and I can't recall interesting details about them.I'm almost convinced Long Story Short was shot amidst the COVID-19 pandemic (it was actually filmed in late 2019), because, aside from an opening scene at a crowded party, the most prominent locations are the characters' houses, a beach and a graveyard. The small number of settings gives the film a limited scope and the low-budget filmmaking is evident, which is never bad, but it's that when Teddy is realising how fast time is going by, the world doesn't seem to change within 10 years and it's another sign that screams unfulfilled potential. Just like the writing, very little about Long Story Short stands out technically. Some of the editing is poor, the cinematography is competent yet looks flat and the modern music choices don't fit well with the film, making it feel cheesy and saccharine, and its tonal balances are consequently rough. While Long Story Short does have some humour, most of its jokes fall flat, and barely anyone in my screening laughed.The pacing mostly fits Long Story Short and helps the time pass, so it didn't drag on. The film's strongest moments are in its most emotional, one is when Teddy discovers some devastating news and, questionable directing aside, Spall's acting sends the impact across. It's when the film attempts to get existential about time and living that it shines. But all of that is completely reversed in an ending that reminded me of Click and if you remember that film, it is impossible not to correctly guess the ending of Long Story Short. But the forced feel-good conclusion ruins the bare existential depths and emotional impact prior to that, and it doesn't feel earned at all. I've never been a fan of romantic comedies and Long Story Short, unfortunately, did little to change that. I can see this resonating with most audiences nevertheless and there's several opportunities for the film to philosophically explore time, love and loss to reach greatness, but in my opinion, Long Story Short simply doesn't take full advantage of its concepts.Plot and Characters (4/10) Presentation and Direction (4/10) Acting (8/10) Script (4/10) Setting/Locations (4/10) Tone (5/10) Cinematography/Visuals (5/10) Sound/Music (4/10) Editing (4/10) Pacing/Length (6/10)Score: 48/100.LIKES: +Rafe Spall, Zahra Newman and Noni Hazlehurst +Some moments of genuine emotion +Existential concept is promising +Solid pacing allows the time to passDISLIKES: -Tonal imbalances between flat humour and drama -Generic direction of unique concept -Off-putting music choices and editing -Limited settings -Uninteresting characters and writing -Safe, clichd ending completely removes the emotional impact"

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10913160/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," Good intentions but... ","My low score is very simple to explain. First, even though the story is not particularly new, it is the handling of it which misses the mark. The dialogue is too often predictable when it isn't clichd. The husband and wife have no real chemistry, and the acting level was "adequate", but although not everyone did a bad job of it, the correct adjective would be "uneven". Sometimes it was rather embarrassingly amateurish - as in the interview with the agent just isn't to be believed for a moment; he overacts to a fault. Finally, from a visual standpoint, it was serviceable, but no real style or punch to it. In the end, I stopped watching from perhaps a third of the way through, because I had no reason to expect any of it to improve."

","Malik (2021) : Movie Review -Malik did not convey anything from the teaser/trailer so what was it all about and what to expect? Several questions like this fueled to underestimation of this crime saga but like we say, whatever happens, happens for the best. Malik was looking like an underdog and that has helped the film to create an atmosphere of less expectations which is completely overtaken by the film like a tsunami. Mahesh Narayanan has delivered two great films already in 2021, 'Aarkkariyam' and 'Nayattu' and he continues the same form with Malik even though the film has couple of drags, but has cringed away in safer zone.A past ridden with crime, death and pain is recounted to Freddy, a juvenile criminal, who has been assigned to eliminate his estranged uncle Sulaiman, an aging patriarch, while behind bars. Malik'a storyline may remind you of severel crime dramas made in the past (all over India), but still it has some things going in its own way for the sake of goodness. That religious hatred and unity factor is effective despite being less explored as maybe the makers didn't want to evoke any controversy. The screenplay is fantastic in spite of a slow start and slow end because the middle portion is Highly engaging and entertaining too. Malik could have had few things done in better way but let it be, not every film can be perfect.Thanks to all the actors in the film who have helped to forgive those few mistakes done by the writer. Fahadh Faasil as Ali Ikka is superb in every scene. From teenage to manhood to aged man, he has transformed very well according to the situations and the demand of the various attitudes. Nimisha Sajayan is one actress to watch out for, not just in Malik but in every film. There is hardly any film where she has failed to deliver what the character demands and this one is surely not that film. While supporting them, Vinay Fortt, Joju George and Jalaja does fine jobs. Overall, the acting unit has provided one solid reason that why this film shouldn't be missed.Malik may look out of the way sometimes and even predictable but even using the cliches is an art and Director Narayanan seems to have mastered it. The technical team has also done a fine job. The background score, cinematography, music, dialogues, artwork etc. Has found fit versions for the narrative and that's why Malik never looks too filmy or unrealistic. Overall, a fantastic effort in every aspect that should get place in your latest watchlist.RATING - 7/10*"

Now, when we get to know that the story of Ahmed Ali Sulaiman (Fahadh Faasil in stellar form) is told from the perspectives of three people through lengthy flashbacks, the structuring slightly goes for a toss. Certain scenes leave lesser impact than they were supposed to. Certain moments (not mentioning any, as they would amount to spoilers) did not affect me the way it was intended to. This was especially the case in the film's closing act. You expect a banger of an ending, but with the way the screenplay's structured, it's inevitable that it can only end in sheer sobriety.With that out of the way, let's focus on the multitude of positives. The cast is outstanding. Be it FaFa, Nimisha Sajayan, Vinay Forrt, Dileesh Pothan, Indrans, Dinesh Prabhakar, Joju George, or anyone else, you can't really complain. The technicalities are top-notch: right from the DOP Sanu Varghese's cinematography (which brilliantly captures the actors at their candid best alongside the coastal, religiously charged milieu) to Sushin Shyam's musical score charging up several sequences. The 12-minute long opening shot is truly something to behold. It's a deep-dive into the psyches of the leads and delineates the connections and power dynamics within the Sulaiman household and its immediate surroundings. Like Vetrimaaran's Vada Chennai, this is a film centred around a particular region - in this case, a couple of coastal towns - the Muslim-dominated Ramadapally and the Christian-dominated Edavathura - in the Thiruvananthapuram suburbs. Solid work on the set designs, I gotta say.Writer-director Mahesh Narayanan incorporates several aspects of the region to the film's main characters and their motivations. Sulaiman, David, Peter, and Abu start off as fishermen (with some local thuggery) and venture later into smuggling because they need the money to build a better future for their families and the communities that they live in. They aren't inherently good or terrible people. These are realistically written anti-heroes painted in multiple shades of grey. Mahesh also handles the religious sentiment aspect sensibly. Each community has its share of leaders and manipulators - some of whom are driven by personal motives. It's a long story (2h 40m) but the editing (by Mahesh himself) is crisp and keeps you engaged all through.Malik is certainly designed for the big screen and it's a shame that we have to watch it on our relatively smaller home screens. By the time the film got over, I wondered what if Mahesh had chosen to split this film into two parts (similar to Vada Chennai) to keep us pining for more. The rise of the gangster within Sulaiman, while strictly textbook, is so damn engrossing, and Fahadh continues to be such a scene-stealer!"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10919240/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","3"," My last two reviews got reported and deleted by Malik fans ","Think of a cantankerous faulty mixer grinder and the cacophonic noise it makes just before exploding. The acting in this film is similar to that cacophony. God it is dreadful. I am glad this was not released in the theater. Or I would have had to tolerate these minnows barking and shouting, convincing themselves that it is great acting.Fahad does well in understated and comedic characters. He simply cannot play a tough guy. A patriarch? No way. He is completely miscast here.The pathetic Nimisha Sajayan gets another big film. I do not know why. Is it some kind of agreement between woke people that this mediocre actress with an unremarkable screen presence (this is an understatement) deserves to be in every big budget production. This carbuncle seems to have impressed all the elites of the Malayalam film industry.As for the script, various plot points and progressions are borrowed from all the gangster movie classics. They have no impact.Watching the film is like drinking a flat beer. It sucks! I really do not understand the raving reviews on social media. People are dumb. They will swallow anything these days. Maybe even poison."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10919240/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Good not great ","Malik was kept on hold for a theatrical release for a long time has now given a direct digital release, since fafa is not a actor behind box office numbers.I thought malik would be fahad's character's name but his name is sulaiman and he is the malik of ramadapally. Film also narrates a fictional take on the real life beemapally shootout.Biggest highlight of malik are the performances. Fafa and nimisha are brilliant as usual, so is vinay fort whose got a very meaty role, dileesh pothan is perfect as crooked politician, indrans shines as the corrupt cop, sanal aman is promising, parvathy krishna is surprising and joju cakewalks as the collector and jalaja as Suleiman's mom reminds you of the mother in agneepath. Cinematography and art direction are another highlight capturing wonderfully the life of the coastal area.But story has nothing new to offer, its the same rise of a gangster and his last days, some scenes are predictable and the script lacks a wow factor.Also I don't understand the purpose of the opening 12 minute one shot sequence as nothing remarkable or dramatic happens like angamaly diaries. I just felt it like some gimmick.On the whole, malik is engaging and watchable mainly because of the performances."

While he is intent on leaving behind his days of crime, politicians, rivals and the larger society around him refuse to let him be.The present day storyline is narrated along with a hyperlink to flashbacks showing how the don built his empire and the bodies and enemies he left in his wake.A gruelling character study augmented by spectacular one-shot cinematography, impactful music and stellar supporting acts, Malik is truly elevated by its scintillating direction.Fahadh Faasil is in desperate need of reinvention, with his methodical, neurotic acting displays getting repetitive. But nevertheless, Malik is an enjoyable potboiler with characters completely in the grey, performing a delicate balancing act between what is morally right and what is wrong, depending upon their circumstances.Nimisha Sajayan is excellent as the don's beleaguered, ever-suffering wife while Joju George and Dileesh Pothen delight in their semi-antagonistic roles. Vinay Forrt is an eyesore with large portions of his performance going overboard.The tight screenplay and excellent direction tide over the flaws in this engaging political drama. Recommended!"

"," Malik, On Amazon Prime Video, Examines The Tragic Interplay Of Religion And Violence ","A short descriptor of Malik could be - a Malayalam Nayakan. Like Mani Ratnam's 1987 classic, this film is also a sprawling story of crime and punishment spanning generations and decades - from 1965 to 2018. The sea plays a pivotal role. Nayakan is set in Mumbai. Malik is set in Ramadapally, a fictional coastal village in Kerala. In both films, the vast waters provide the backdrop for smuggling and romance. And in both, the protagonists are criminals who lead lawless lives but also have a strong moral centre. Velu Naicker and Sulaiman Malik are benevolent monarchs of the area they operate in and protect. But their lives are tainted by violence and loss. They age as we watch and both are eventually laid low by tragedy and time. At the end of Nayakan, when Velu's grandson asks him, 'Are you good or bad?', he says: I don't know. I suspect that if the question was put to Sulaiman, his reply would be the same."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10919240/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Grim ","I watched the much awaited Malik (orig. Malayalam w/Eng.subs) on Primevideo.Suleman Malik (Fahadh Faasil) a respected one time smuggler of Ramadapally village is at the airport for his Haj flight but is picked up by the police as he is about to board and given 14days remand. A politically expedient decision is taken to finish him off by "suicide" in that time. A police encounter would backfire so Malik's brother in law and one time dearest friend David's (Vinay Fortt) teenage son Franky who is arrested for an unrelated assault, is brainwashed and agrees to do the dirty deed.Most of the narration is in flashback showing Suleman as a child in the coastal village, how he becomes best friends with David, how they rise from selling petty smuggled goods to building a proper school for the village kids and becoming respected if not quite above board figures in their communities. Ramadapally is a coastal village where the predominant Muslims and Christians live harmoniously. The new collector (Joju George) appears supportive of Malik as does the local politician Aboobaker (Dileesh Pothan). Expectations and aspirations grow all round. Malik and David's smuggling enterprise grows, with added risks. David's sister Rosalyn is in love with Malik. The three move to safer ground to the Maldives where Malik and Rosalyn get married. Political games are in full form while they are away and tensions simmer between the two communities.Watch to see how this grim tale pans out. Dont miss the twist in the post credit scenes.The locations are good, the sets realistic, the story draws a lot from what happens in reality with politically created tensions and their terrible consequences. Ofcourse I think Fahadh Faasil is India's best actor today, however lets be fair: All the characters are convincingly portrayed by the respective actors. The overall mood is Grim. The English subtitles are correctly synched and of a high standard."

","......they made this movie and took back Malayalam cinema by a couple of decades atleast. Bollywood was making similar themed movies and considerably better than this abomination in the mid 90's. Who are these people who have been living in caves and think that this is 9/10 movie. They will probably have a mind blasting experience if they watch the Godfather or something similar.Can I have my 21/2 hours back. There are a billion things that I could have done in these 21/2 hours that would have been better than this mess called a movie. I could have just stared at the wall for 21/2 hours and that would still be a more rewarding experience.Can someone find this guy who made this movie and destroy his camera. Are people at Amazon deaf that they heard this story and decided to invest in it. If you have tons of money to blow then feed the hungry or build homes or better still,travel to space or something. Please stop greenlighting these insults to moviemaking.The plot is disjointed, the acting is nothing to write home about. If I spend 5 mins thinking about the movie I could come up with a dozen unanswered questions about the movie. But I have wasted enough time already. I watched this garbage called The Guest(2014) in the afternoon and even though that was bad it was still a serious improvement over Malik.This is the kind of movie that even Fahadh cannot redeem. This movie is so bad that amateurish actor Nimisha Sajayan who cannot act to save her life has come across as better than Fahadh. What is the thinking that goes into making these sort of movies. The director decided to make a groundbreaking movie after the ground had already been been broken in the 90's. Even Kammatipaadam was infinitely better than this.Just mind boggling that someone decided to make something like this in 2021 after it had been done hundreds of times in the past.Politicians turn communities against each other for their own gains. Oh my God. This is such a novel idea and so unique and groundbreaking. I hope somebody makes a movie about it.I am just so angry. Who is this clown who made this movie. Did he stop learning to count at 99. Does he lick windows in his pastime. Why are these people being encouraged.Just such a waste of my time. Just so angry."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10919240/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," Brilliant Movie! ","According to the Director, Mahesh Narayanan, this is his version of The Godfather or Nayakan. Despite these resemblances (and to Vada Chennai), this movie stands apart. I don't wanna talk much about the plot since it's new, and one you wouldn't want to miss, but those names must give you an idea of what the movie is about.There is also a communal layer to story which is always a slippery slope, and it's easy to throw one community or the other in bad light for the sake of the plot 'cuz you know it'll sell, & to draw a line between good/bad but this film deals with all that with ease. That ending, IMO, deserves separate slow claps.The movie moves back and forth in time to tell the story from various perspectives, and the editing was great and this didn't seem choppy at all. The sound design was very well done and the cinematography was really good as well - be it continuous shots (look close or you'll miss it), the drone shots of the coastlines, or just plain close angles.The acting - forget the leads, all of the supporting cast did a great job worthy enough of separate mentions, but I can't make this too long. I don't think I'll say anything about Fahad that hasn't already been said, but can this man do any wrong? Just when you think he's done it all.... Forget Fahad, can Nimisha Sajayan do anything wrong? Based on TGIK, Nayattu and this (in 2021 ALONE!), if she doesn't get some sort of a National Award, it will be a robbery like Mollywood hasn't seen in recent times. To share screens with Fahad is big, but to overshadow THAT dude in the same scenes he's in...!?Yes, the movie was long at 2 hr 40 mins or so. Yes, I'd have liked a shorter one, but what do you cut down on? Hell, I thought I'd have enjoyed 2 two hour parts of this movie. Could have watched move. It did feel like something was missing (emotional attachment to some of the characters, i guess?) but who cares, it's a brilliant movie regardless.Do not miss this. It's a long watch, but totally worth it. Wish I could say more."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10919240/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Almost cult ","Nimisha did much more of a performance than Fahad. She has quite a few variations to perform, and has rendered each of those portions really well.Vinay Fort shared screen space easily with Fahad, and proved his acting mettle. Hope this will be a turning point for his acting career.Fahad did not have as much of a performance challenge in this movie. There were scenes that Fahad performed well, but there were also scenes where he was not convincing.Sushin Shyam's music and background score blended in well at some points, while at other points were a bit too loud, and unsubdued. Liked the eighties style song.Execution had touches of brilliance. The starting 12 minute shot was definitely impressive. Some plot points were good, but the script had quite a few fundamental flaws. Once the script failed me at a couple of points, I started feeling consistent low points through out the script.When the movie ended, I was not as thrilled to have watched it, but when I placed my foot on the floor, it got wet. I took another step, and I was walking in water. I had turned off all the lights to get a late night theatre movie ambience. Not sure why the pipe leading to the refrigerator had to have had a leak while we were watching the movie. But the theatre ambience and the full length sofa seating let the water seep in quietly.The twists after the movie were far less predictable than the ones in the movie. Definitely worth a watch for all the hard work that has gone into the movie. It is a major undertaking, and a lot of awesome work has gone into the movie. However, it did not get into the cult league that I was wanting for 'Malik'."

The story is clieched, communtiy protects him from police. Flash back - how he became like this.I heard the beemapalli incident was inspired for this story, if that all, the true story has been terribly changed for appeasment.The 12 minutes continuous shot didnt brought much attention / plus point to the movie,Nimisha sajayan is always the same face from the first movie itself., the problem is , by putting a dull face, all thinks that that the expression which can be taken seriously.We should learn from the acting of Nayan Tara, Manju Varrier, Parvathy how to act serious without smile, not putting the same face all over again.Being serious doesnt mean no expression. Eyes, Lips, and dieloague tone should justify the seriousness, but her role failed in all .Fahad didnt had much acting in this as well. Story is predictable and dragging for 2.5 + hours,I liked the cinematography , thats all.On the whole this movie has been with the flood of forcefully being good due to the historic flicks of crew and cast."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10919240/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," FaFa owns Malik ","Fafa owns this flick and is rightly its Malik, showing immense versality yet again. The execution is sharp, effective and at times awe-inspiring. Even as the yesteryear scenes of this saga that connects a true event in the past have been accurately depicted in terms of the mood and settings, a few of the plot points seem to be a little exaggerated.The transformation of Sulaiman into a Malik too lacks depth and happens almost abruptly.Spoilers alert :The flick starts with a well-crafted, long opening sequence, which sets the tone straight away giving out a glaring message that we are in for a treat. With a raw and an exciting screenplay, the flick progresses in a smooth manner. The depiction of the past and it's settings have been precise too. Fahadh Faasil delivers a stunning performance yet again with applaudable variations in body lmannerisms throughout his progression from a carefree, hot headed teenager to the aged, composed yet fierce Malik. Other actors have done their parts well too, but it is Vinay Fort who stands out with a stellar performance.Yet, there are a few exaggerated scenes, so untypical of a Mahesh Narayanan flick, even for the mighty Sulaiman's crew like a boat turning into a minivan and a fishermen's vessel being refurbished as a mini-submarine to evade the attention of coastguard. Also, the becoming of Malik has not been well-established. Did he achieve the feat just by shifting a few trash bags?Malik is nevertheless a riveting watch and should not be missed."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10919240/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," A bit boring and plain ","The script does not have that intrigue factor. It just goes in an uninteresting way. The non linear narrative does not help much.Fahadh simply cannot do such a big role. His acting has its limitations. He should stick to doing things in his area. Rest of the cast too are just average.Background music was kind of good, camera and all the technical stuff too were also kind of good. But the rest is just average at best. Watch it only if you have nothing better to do."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10919240/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," A FILM WHICH IS HEAVY FROM SEVERAL ASPECTS ","Mahesh Narayanan's Malik starring Fahadh Faasil as the protagonist, can be considered as one of the best Indian films that came out this year. The movie starts with a 12-minute single shot scene which is a cinematography textbook and a masterclass in unconventional and non-traditional filmmaking. The camera movement is so smooth and flexible despite having several types of angles and shots such as warping, panning, tracking, trucking, long, close, medium, dolly and random movements.The director managed to keep a good pace throughout the film but at certain times the viewer may feel slight disconnections from what's on the screen.The performance of the entire cast is simply stunning except that of one or two actors who doesn't have much importance.The story is about Ahammadali Suleiman(Fahadh Faasil), a businessman and smuggler who has a certain amount of power in his area - Ramadapally. His area is the home for two religious communities. He ends up facing communalism created by politicians and police officers.The story shows a total of four periods in a non-linear manner. Only the second, third and fourth periods have the screen presence of Fahadh. The second period shows his youth, the third - his middle age, the fourth shows him as an old person. The performance of Fahadh in second and third periods were good but his acting in the fourth period is the most appreciable. It was something which we have never seen before from Fahadh. The second and third were something usual from him. Overall, Fahadh is successful in transforming him into the character of Ahammadali Suleiman.But still, the best performer in the film is Nimisha Sajayan and this should be considered as her career best performance.The screenplay is well-written, especially the dialogues. The way of narration is non-linear and there occured a problem. Non-linearity here, is with the usage of flashbacks, the viewer may find a disconnection when watching the flashbacks and the present events. The entry to the first flashback is written in a cliche manner - narrated by a person to another, and from there the return to the present was written in a similar, unconvincing and dull manner.Another negative - the Theerame song which was placed in the film was pretty good to hear but it was unnecessary. That song served three purposes - 1. Showcasing the romance and emotional attachment which occured between Roseline and Suleiman 2. Filling up or time lapsing 3. Some gratification to the viewer. Anyway, that song had a tonal, lyrical and vocal beauty. But when it is looked as a part of this film, I don't like to appreciate because the writer-director Mahesh Narayanan should have focused on writing something instead of placing this song.A factor which played a huge role in elevating the effect which the film can deliver is Sushin Shyam's Background Score which was pulsating and exhilarating.Overall, the film is definitely worth watching."

","Nearing the closing weekend of the 2021 Glasgow Film Festival,I decided to go for one of the three "World Premier" screenings/streams taking place. Becoming curious about the title due to it being the only one of the trio I could not find any advance reviews of,I got set to meet my sweetheart.View on the film:Revealing in a interview with the two lead actresses afterwards that the film was shot in just three weeks,predominantly on a real holiday camp, writer/director Marley Morrison makes a superb coming of age, feature film debut.Morrison overcomes the original cinematographer quitting in the middle of production, thanks to balancing stylish, over-saturated close-ups on the loved-up eyes of AJ's sightings of Isla, with the glorious un- sentimental image of the British holiday camp, with Morrison snapping hilarious antics in the confined living conditions of AJ and her family, and their attempt to get into the holiday spirit, under the dreary weather.Mentioning in the discussion after the screening that she got the idea for the setting from it being a British working class tradition to spend Summer family breaks in a holiday camp, the screenplay by Morrison follows AJ's coming of a age with excellent characterization, which is unafraid to paint her in a less then flattering light during her moody bickering with family members, that cleverly heightens the rose-tinted glasses mind-set AJ has when she comes of age when falling head over heels for Isla.Appearing in every scene, Nell Barlow gives a fantastic performance as AJ,thanks to Barlow bringing out a comedic edge to AJ's frustrations of being dragged along on this holiday, with a growing warmth to the growing bond with her family,and AJ's passionate, bitter-sweet embrace of Isla. Catching AJ's attention due to smelling of chlorine, Ella-Rae Smith gives an enchanting turn as Isla,which blends sweet hazy passions with raw frustrations,as AJ meets her sweetheart."

It stars Nell Barlow as AJ, a troubled, depressed adolescent. Jo Hartley portrays Tina, her mother. Ella-Rae Smith is Isla, a lifeguard at the caravan beach resort where the family goes for a vacation.AJ is the protagonist, so we naturally want to see things her way. However, she's hard to like. In movies, as in life, sullen depressed people pull you down, even when you try to lift them up. That's how the movie starts, and the plot continues from there.This is a pretty good film, especially because the actors are talented professionals. It's definitely not a feel-good movie, although it has its moments. We saw Sweetheart virtually as part of ImageOut, the outstanding Rochester LGBT Film Festival. The movie has an IMDb rating of 6.9. I agreed, and rated it 7."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10919362/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," A "Gregory's Girl" for Gen-Z ","When I was in my late teen's, Bill Forsyth's "Gregory's Girl" perfectly epitomised the angst of the school years' emotions I'd left behind me. And I was very much heterosexual. With "Sweetheart", Marley Morrison in an astonishing feature debut delivers a "Gregory's Girl" for today's much more sexually fluid times.Positives: What a great ensemble cast! It's all headed up by Nell Barlow, amazingly in her feature debut. Nell manages to perfectly deliver the hair-pullingly frustrating unpredictability of a teenage girl: always planning to go off doing something worthy like "knitting jumpers for elephants in Indonesia". But she manages to keep the portrayal just the right side of parody, not straying into 'Kevin and Perry' territory. "What's wrong with you?" asks her mother. "I'm 17. Everything's wrong with me" she replies. It's an immaculate performance for someone so young.Jo Hartley is also fabulous as A. J.'s mum, a lost soul struggling with her own worries, without having those of AJ to add to them. It's not portrayed as a typical 'Mum v Teen' battle, but beautifully nuanced. "Just because you're a lesbian now, it doesn't mean you have to dress like a boy" she pleads with A. J.If you're trying to place her, Ella Rae-Smith was the striking girl in the baseball cap in Netflix's "The Stranger". She is also wonderful here, as the 'hot girl' who you think has it all but is underneath deeply troubled and conflicted. A sex scene (beautifully lit and filmed - by either Emily Almond Barr or Matthew Wicks - manages to show absolutely nothing but is deliciously erotic as a result.The writing by Marley Morrison feels very autobiographical. And, as I found through reading this Guardian article about Morrison's gender-journey, there is a lot of personal experience in here. It's clever that the film is claustrophobically set in the remote holiday park (actually the real Freshwater Beach Holiday Park near Bridport on the Dorset coast). If it had been set in a big city like London, AJ could have constantly fled from her feelings, never resolving them. Here, she is constantly running into Isla.... there is no escape.I also very much liked the relationship written between A. J. and Steve. Steve is almost the safety valve on the pressure cooker, always helpfully allowing some steam to escape. It adds warmth to the story.For such an indie picture, there's a range of great tunes on the soundtrack: mostly from bands I have never heard of (probably making it affordable). I'm not sure if there's to be a soundtrack album released, but it's worth a listen if so.Negatives: I wasn't fond of the sound mix on the film. Some of the dialogue was indistinct.A. J. gives us an occasional running commentary of her thoughts as a voiceover. Regular readers of my blog will know my thoughts on this subject! I'm not sure if it added much to the story: a 'show-not-tell' approach would have been my preference.Summary Thoughts on "Sweetheart": I likened this film to 1980's "Gregory's Girl", and that's a great compliment. That movie made stars out of John Gordon Sinclair and Clare Grogan. I'd predict similar great things for Nell Barlow, Ella Rae-Smith and particularly for writer/director Marley Morrison. I'll very much look forward to Marley's future projects. It's a cracking little British film. It deserves a major cinema release, but I suspect this is one that you might need to hunt out at your less mainstream cinemas. But please do so - it's well worth it. Very much recommended.(For the full graphical review and video, check out #onemannsmovies on the web, Facebook and Tiktok. Thank-you!)"

However It seemed like someone's idea of the ideal way of coming out rather than what I guess real life is actually like.It's ok if a little slow and maybe could have been a bit more like real life with a more realistic live interest."

I'm not sure the sexuality matters so much it's just love whatever your sex. Great film to get you thinking!"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10919362/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Full of heart ","This was such a great film. The type of film that evokes almost the full spectrum of emotions! I laughed, felt frustration, annoyance, sadness and mu heart glowed a lot by the end! Serious subjects and issues confronted but in an accessible and very relatable way.At the beginning what seem to be fairly obvious and stereotypical (even comical?) characters, soon become complex and deeply developed people with who most people could find reflections of themselves. I thought the performances were excellent. Most significantly by Nell Barlow, Ella-Rae Smith and the sometimes overlooked Jo Hartley, who I wish we saw more of. I hope after this film she is considered for lead parts in prime time dramas.A British set film."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10919362/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","1"," Contrived, predictable and boring ","Every character, setting, dialogue and event is so contrived, predictable and ultimately unforgivably boring. Nothing new to say at all. Really cringeworthy dialogue at certain times. Seems like an A-level student drama brought to the screen. Imagine every cliche out there thrown into a blender and what you get is a very boring plate of plain mashed potato. Nothing offensive just dreadfully dull.The camera work is so shoddy that many times angles are fixed on screen.Am a big supporter of small, independent art house movies but stuff like this gives those a bad name. Can't believe the National Lottery funded this."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10925852/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Powerful and moving postpartum depression family drama ","As "A Mouthful of Air" (2021 release; 106 min.) opens, we are introduced to Julie, a young mother who has a beautiful baby boy and an adoring husband. Yet something isn't quite alright as she seems to struggle taking care of the baby. Soon she spins out of control, and she has suicidal thoughts... At this point we are less than 10 min into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this film is truly a labor of love from Amy Koppelman, who adapts her novel of the same name into a movie. Koppelman is the movie's writer, producer and director (making her feature length debut). I haven't read the book so I can't comment how closely the film sticks to the book. Watching the film as a standalone, I was gripped from the beginning and it didn't take me long to be emotionally invested in the main characters. The movie benefits tremendously by the lead performance from Amanda Seyfried as Julie, in what is one of her best movie roles to date, period. Amy Irvin is a surprise (in the best possible way) as Julie's mom. Paul Giamatti also is quite good as Julie's doctor. The movie is plot-heavy so I can't really comment on how it all plays out. I will say this: this movie flew by in no time (for me anyway). Last but not least: kudos for the somber piano-fronted original score, courtesy of composer John Grtler, whom I had not heard of before."A Mouthful of Air" was filmed 2 years ago and would've been released in 2020, but for a little thing called COVID-19. The movie finally was released in select theater this weekend, and I couldn't wait to see it. The Saturday early evening screening where I saw this at my art-house theater here in Cincinnati was not attended well: exactly 3 people (including myself). Regardless, if you are in the mood for a heavy-duty postpartum depression family drama featuring a powerful Amanda Seyfried, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater (while you still can), on Amazon Instant Video, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10925852/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Draw Your Own Conclusions ","Tough to Find the Intention and Obstacle in this Film but each viewer will take it differently. Smart Move without the Blood. Amanda Seyfried really gets the character and her Facial expressions are priceless. I am impressed with her taking on these Emotional Roles, like (The Art of Racing in the Rain) and (Fathers and Daughters). The pace of Movie maybe an issue with Some but recommend riding it out to the very end. Sticks with you, so I may do some editing to my comments after sleeping on it."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10925852/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," So emotional.... ","This film is about mental health, postpartum depression. I love the way they directed the film. Instead of showing knife or bloody scene, they showed her facial expression to let us feel the pain. Such an emotional movie. Amanda did an amazing job portrait her character."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10925852/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," A must see, but no joyride! ","It is so hard to write a spoiler free review for this, as you literally just notice the brilliance of this movie, when its in the last 10seconds!I will say, the fact how it plays with time, anticipation, expectation and delivery, is simply sooo well done, that you probably can see it twice and still appreciate how well done it is.The fact that Alysia Reiner and Jennifer Carpenter have such big names, but only appear in the movie for a couple of minutes, if even, is completely ok, even though unexpected AND it just shows you how captivating Amanda Seyfried can be in this, best performance of her career by a landslide.This movie delivers exactly what "C'mon C'mon" failed to do, it engages you fully into the emotional rollercoaster that movie is. Not for the faint hearted, as it for sure is a sensitive topic, but if you do a movie about this so well, you just have to acknowledge it!"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10925852/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," A great movie on postpartum depression ","Movie was so good that it gets under your skin. After watching the last scene one would be speechless and as the title says one would be left with a mouthful of air (as a metaphor).Seriously, all actors did a fabulous job especially Amanda and she deserves an Oscar for a role of a mother suffering from anxiety and depression.This movie cannot be described in words as the movie itself was based on a novel written by the director. It just got to be watched on screen (big/small) to feel the emotions felt by the actors.Movie has some simple animations depicting the mood of the main protagonist and also has beautiful poetic moments.Just go and watch it. My rating is 10/10."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10925852/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," Whether you like or not depends on you ","I saw this with my wife. I liked it. She hated it and wanted to walk out. What I liked were the performances. It's a tough topic and I thought Amanda Seyfried pulled it off well. My wife was focused on the story. She thought it started off depressing and then went downhill. She ordinarily doesn't mind dark subject matter, but she also wants Hollywood endings that end on an "up" note and the birth of a grandchild didn't get her there. I think it also hit home because it touched upon some personal areas for her.One thing that we both didn't like was the ambiguity over Julie's father. At first, he's only visible in flashback and he's absent. My first thought was that her dad sexually abused her. Later, in a flashback, they show her running up the stairs and her father is just about to beat her so we think "Oh, it must be physical abuse". Then he reappears and shows her how to paint but begins to touch her in what - if left unchecked - would be inappropriate for a father/daughter and we think "Oh, so maybe it was sexual abuse after all." I know that some moviemakers think its artistic to "let the audience interpret" but we both hate that. If they're going to say something, say it - don't just let it hang out there. Then again, maybe that's how its written in the book? Anyway, that bugged us both."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10925852/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," Go see! 10/10 ","I saw in theatres an hour ago and the movie really does affect you still after finishing it. Amanda seyfried did such a great job, you truly feel her pain throughout the movie, such an honest and difficult topic but so well done! Recommend, haven't felt this touched by a movie since Olivia Wilde's life itself."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10925852/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," Most impactful drama I've seen probably ever ","I have watched MANY dramas in my lifetime. Some have been hits, some haven't been. There's an art to making a slow drama. Everything from the camera work to facial expressions to the most miniscule of details matter because you spend so much time sitting with them and that's what will make you come away with something valuable or with feeling like you've wasted your time. I also rarely rate something a 10. This movie deserves every star. I don't think there was a single thing I would change. The story's impact resonated with me so much that I know I'll be thinking about it for years to come. And Amanda Seyfried, who I knew was a good actress, absolutely blew me away with her performance. She brought so much life to the character she played and acted it so well I could understand everything she was feeling from one second to the next just with the subtle shifts in her expression. A masterful performance and a completely amazing movie."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10925852/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," Very important story ","A story involving depression, articulated in a very truthful performance. Story concerning its effects on a person and the people around them. Hit me deeply as knowing first hand loved ones that experience such intensity. Wonderfully performed by Amanda Seyfried. Directed beautifully by Amy Koppelman."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10925852/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","2"," Most Depressing Movie I have Ever Seen! ","I wanted to like this movie. The acting was good, the topic is important. However, not long into the movie, my mother kept saying, "Can it get anymore depressing?" and actually asked to leave. I kept hoping (and assuring her) there would be a glimmer of hope, a turn, a victory, something to encourage those that deal with depression, anxiety, and OCD behaviors. Yet the movie ends hopeless. How is this a responsible message? Yes, the topic needs to be addressed. Yes, not all situations have a happy ending. But I kept thinking through the whole movie, if I dealt with these mental health issues, I would leave feeling completely helpless, the opposite of what those who struggle need to experience. Isn't the point of mental health being addressed recently and at the forefront of much media for people to realize there is help and hope?"

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10926320/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," a rom-com for today ","Greetings again from the darkness. One must presume that many Millennials in their mid-to-late 20s will recognize and relate to the characters and situations in this indie Romantic Comedy from writer-director Jonah Feingold. For those born prior to 1980, that's likely to be more challenging, and in fact, some of the conversations may more closely resemble a foreign language than familiar human exchanges. We can almost picture the emoji's as these characters speak.Milo (Jaboukie Young-White) and Wendy (Francesca Reale) are two single New Yorkers who match on the cleverly-named dating app, "Meet Cute". Of course, that's also the cinematic description for most every Rom-Com initial introduction since the days of Howard Hawks, Frank Capra, and Ernst Lubitsch. After a perfect first date-turned one-night stand, Milo and Wendy ghost each other. Three weeks later they have a caf meeting where Wendy presents a "Best Friends with Benefits" contract. He wants more, while she just wants this. BFWB is a step beyond FWB since it's more than sex. The two will regularly hang out and offer each other life and relationship advice - but definitely no "I love you" or PDA. Even their friends Hank (Brian Muller) and Jessie (Catherine Cohen) recognize this for the bad idea it is ... but Hank and Jessie are too distracted developing their own bond to care too much.Feingold utilizes some very cool water colors over the opening credits, and Grant Fonda's score is spot on throughout. There will be comparisons to FRIENDS WITH BENEFITS and NO STRONGS ATTACHED, two movies released in 2011. However, a better and more interesting connection is to see how Feingold was influenced by WHEN HARRY MET SALLY... (1989) and ANNIE HALL (1977), two of the very best romantic comedies. Just keep in mind that this film is for those born in this modern era, where the rules of dating are determined by social media and dating (hook-up) apps. We are told that Millennials are "cursed with choices".Feingold's characters discover break-up email templates (these people can't subject themselves to face-to-face conflict), the real world expense of wedding planners, the confusing dynamics of haggling over who pays for dinner and drinks, and of course, the importance of guacamole. The characters are believable and seem like folks we could know ... except when they speak. Jerry Ferrara (Turtle in "Entourage") plays doorman Cole and also serves as the film's narrator, a welcome guide through the reasons behind the actions.Cinematographer Maria Rusche effectively captures the familiar sites of NYC, as well as the food and drink moments that go with dating. Director Feingold comes up short in his cameo, although in a humorous way. The four lead actors are not yet household names, and probably won't be recognized by most viewers - though expect them to be part of the next wave. Mostly Feingold keeps things light and cutesy, and whether intentionally or not, reminds us that social media can be manipulative and controlling. Those pushing 30, especially New Yorkers, will likely enjoy seeing their life on screen, while the rest of us simply wonder how hooking up and hanging out isn't considered a serious relationship.In select theaters and available on digital beginning September 10, 2021."

","First time feature director Jonah Feingold offers a fresh take on the romantic comedy genre with Dating & New York. As with 2018's digital-centric film Searching, Feinfold authentically utilizes FaceTime, Instagram, text messaging, dating apps, and modern communication tools to serve the story. The film explores the new challenges and endless potential for dating in the digital era. While watching, one wonders whether dating apps and the ability to swipe left and right doomed relationships for millenials, or perhaps made romances even stronger when two strangers find a connection amidst this superficial dating backdrop.Francesca Reale and Jaboukie Young-White are experly cast, each displaying that rare range between painful awkwardness and true heart. With echoes of Noah Baunbach's Frances Ha sprinkled throughout, Dating & New York becomes an impressive entry about cutting through the clutter of shallow relationships and friendships in the pursuit of something genuine."
