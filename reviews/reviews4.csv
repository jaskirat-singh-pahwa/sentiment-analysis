"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10339052/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," 8 stars for the terrific acting performance by Michael Caine, but only 7 stars for a less than great direction... ","The good: Michael Caine, Michael Caine, Michael Caine.Any bad? Lacking in greatness in direction.Still recomended for all those fans of Michael Caine (and of Aubrey Plaza).The story: it's a slowburning tale about a young woman (Aubrey Plaza) who needs an old guy like Michael Caine to publish another book, in order not to go bankrupt with her book publishing company.The chemistry between Caine and Plaza is admirable. With a bit more tight knit direction this movie could have risen to greater highs, but as it is now, it is definitely a funny and lovely lighthearted buddy drama about 2 persons slowly growing fond of each other...Does really deserve more attention then the mere 30 Imdb reviews, because this is quite an intimate gem!"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10339052/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," I got what I wanted from this movie, safely predictable, a comfort zone to make you feel good in the end ","Michael Caine is 88, he plays his age like the pro that he is and he will bring you from despising Harris Shaw, his character, to loving Harris Shaw, in the course of the story and thanks to the determination of Lucy Stanbridge, owner of the publishing company, played by the delightful Aubrey Plaza.Shaw is a cantankerous curmudgeon writer who Lucy Stanbridge gets to open up, to her, after he nearly ruined her. She picks up wisdom from Shaw, as he finds peace from her caring for him. Predictable just like the movie magic doctors prescribed for your enjoyment. It's the classic from hopeless to hopeful to peace and new goals. Basically life, if you're lucky.You may shed a tear or two because it works that way if you understand or can relate to hardship and to final peace, especially if you're up in age yourself. There's just something special when generational differences act as the glue that fixes things. It got me right in my sentimental sweet spot, got me good."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10339052/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Should have been so much better ","Movie review: Best SellersIN A NUTSHELL: In a last-ditch effort to save the boutique publishing house her father has left her after his death, an ambitious young editor goes on a book tour with an aging, bitter, and boozy author who was one of the first writers to put the publishing house on the map. The film is directed by Lina Roessler and written by Anthony Grieco.THINGS I LIKED: As an author and an author coach, I simply had to watch this movie. I was curious to see what they were going to do with the story and with the legendary Sir Michael Caine. By the way, in order to properly pronounce his name with is own accent, say "My Cocaine." ha ha It sounds just like him, right?Great opener with the cat and introduction to Sir Michael Caine's crusty character.The cast also includes Aubrey Plaza, who gives a mature performance, and Ellen Wong as the faithful employee.Didn't everyone fall in love with Cary Elwes after watching The Princess Bride? Sadly, he's only in one tiny scene in the film.There are some tender, touching moments.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE: Considering the movie is about literature, the writing is surprisingly pedestrian and disappointing.I hate watching people smoke and drink themselves to death.There are some bad, shallow acting moments, none by Sir Michael Caine, of course.Super cheesy music.Extremely predictable.Some side storylines completely disappear with no resolution.TIPS FOR PARENTS: English and British profanity, including F-bombs (spoken and written) A man urinates in public A man flips the bird You see a woman throw up Drunken, selfish, indulgent behavior Lots of alcoholYou can see the rest of my review on my Movie Review Mom YouTube channel."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10339052/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," A real disappointment that Caine didn't have a better vehicle ","It's set in modern times and tells the story of a young publisher who has inherited her presumed dead father's respected publishing house. It follows her interaction with a famous author who had one masterpiece decades earlier but has published nothing since.Lucy Stanbridge (Aubrey Plaza), the young publisher, has specialized in young adult fiction, but things are not going well. Her former boyfriend, Jack Sinclair (Scott Speedman), wants to buy the business and merge it into his much larger enterprise. Lucy and her assistant, Rachel (Ellen Wong), decide they need a book sensation to get Stanbridge Publishing back on track. They discover that Harris Shaw (Michael Caine) had written one great book published by Lucy's father, Joseph (Luc Morissette). In fact, Shaw's contract indicates he owes the publisher one more book.The rest of the movie follows Lucy's efforts to get a book from the abusive, reclusive, foul-mouthed, alcoholic Shaw. Once achieving that goal, the rest of the film follows the book tour that Lucy Stanbridge and Harris Shaw take to promote the book. All of Shaw's faults shine throughout the book tour until we learn the cause of Shaw's pain in the end.This is another of those movies that can't figure out what it wants to do. Initially, it edges towards comedy but then tries to lapse into drama. Neither works all that well. There are moments when Michael Caine's characterization of an 80-something curmudgeon works well, but basically, something is amiss in the screenplay. It's a real disappointment that Caine didn't have a better vehicle."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10339052/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Sentimental ","Writers, novel writers certainly, should rise up against their movie clich. In movies, painters and musicians are presented as sociable, attractive even, characters, but book writers are alcoholic misanthropes whose only company are cats.This film takes this and similar tropes and applies the movie clich of incompatible partners/opposites coming to like each other as well as the old man and young woman dichotomy, both of whom are on their uppers, albeit in different ways. Formulas are proven and so we are set on our way.While the premise is established, the journey, literally, does offer some fresher angles, at least in terms of the publishing business. The blunt speech, calling cant for what it is, the pervasiveness of social media and celebrity, the shallowness of our culture, are done comically and with effect. How the calque curse word took hold is a mystery.The pacing and editing keep things going well as we move from one plot point to the next and although it's not necessarily new material, the energy does not flag. The photography and locations are striking, somber and moody, wintry light which adds a more realistic edge to the narrative.But the reason to stay with this story are the performances. Casting can elevate a film even if the other aspects are a little staid and that's what is on show here. Caine and Plaza hold it together as both leads take us through the journey where their antagonism turns to friendship. It's sentimental, just like the movie poster of Caine grinning.They are supported with a good team of actors too and while the humans did their job admirably, the cat deserves an award for a memorable and nuanced cameo performance; perhaps even Best Supporting Actor would be fitting, if species rules are not still enforced."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10339052/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Great, funny, little movie ","Don't hate the haters. They just got it wrong.Aubrey Plaza shows she's actually an actress who can play her weird self or someone completely different. Please don't pigeonhole people... And Michael Cane is brilliant as ever.The script makes fun of literary agents, cultural fads, millennials (which is unavoidable) and general norms.Great fun, with a sliver of drama. Definitely some tear-jerking at the end, for the faint of heart, but overall a great watch."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10339052/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," This is actually a slow-burn mystery. Really well done! ","On the surface, the storyline of "Best Sellers" seems simple enough. Young book editor Lucy Stanbridge (Aubrey Plaza), who recently inherited Stanbridge Publishing from her father, attracts famous but long-silent author Harris Shaw (Michael Caine) back into business after he unexpectedly has a new novel to offer. They set out on a publicity road tour in and around Boston and New York, and lots is learned about both of them, leading up to a revelatory finish. By turns it's poignant, wry, funny, or all three at once. It's a 'little' film, very human-centered, and really well done. Michael Caine is predictably excellent, so it turns out that the success of the film depends a lot on Aubrey Plaza's acting (is he going to steal every scene, or can she stand up to him?) since she's probably on screen the most of all. Turns out she does pretty well, and it's not just him that we end up interested in.The character-driven progress of the story is all about how Lucy tries to manage Harris through her publisher's agenda of getting the new book publicized versus his stubborn resistance ('crusty old codger' doesn't say the half of it). The script leaves a lot of questions hanging in the air. Why is Harris so cranky and at times downright mean to her, his own agent? Why is he an apparently self-loathing drunk and why hasn't he written anything in 40 years? What about her father, who was Harris's editor long ago? Is the new book going to take off, or her company going to go under? All these questions get clever and complete answers, and when they do, the story suddenly starts to cut a lot deeper and gain many new layers. I thought, though, a bit too much of the Reveal got packed into the last 20 minutes or so of Act 3. The long central Act 2 is all about the road trip, which is always teetering hilariously on the brink of collapse. Lucy is constantly driven to distraction, and Harris constantly looks so rumpled and dissolute that you wonder if Michael Caine himself is really that frail; is it all an act?There's a quietly brilliant set of scenes where Lucy gets fed up with Harris's recalcitrance and recruits fans to do readings from his new book instead, which then go viral on the Web. And another where devoted readers ceremonially burn the book after reading it (which makes pefect sense in context -- you have to see it).And the ending -- also very quietly done, but Wow. Everything is going to be all right. And it's satisfying, not just something that was pulled in out of left field. It makes perfect sense knowing what we know by then about Harris and his hidden history. What's an author going to do for 40 years except write?"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10339052/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," Nice to see Michael Caine ","But I would have enjoyed him more if it was in another role, instead of sick, alcoholic and dirty.Apart from Mr Caine there was not much to see. Aubrey Plaza should stick to roles such as the one in Dirty Grandpa. This is what she excels at. I do understand as when she grows older she wants to find new roles, but obviously it is not for her. My tip is that she should do a couple more vulgar ones, save the money and retire.Her assistant was not very good, either.Boring story, too."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10339052/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Unexpectedly good movie ","Wow, wasn't expecting this, this turned out to be a very nice movie, it was funny and emotional at the same time, good performance and Michael Caine was simply amazing."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10339052/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Solid, but not exceptional ","There's a bit more here than what you'd expect from this kind of story, but not a whole lot more. No problem with the acting. Serviceably shot. Has more to say about the publishing industry than I had expected. Yet there does feel like there is something missing to distinguish itself further. Worth a watch but doubt it'll stay with me for long."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10339052/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," Like two peas in a pod.. ","I am a huge Michael Caine and Aubrey Plaza fan so when I saw this film I was over the moon and excited. The two of them are a dynamic duo and I really enjoyed this film.It's light hearted, Michael proves he is a true gentleman, a genius and one of the greatest actors on the planet. Aubrey is always a delight so I recommend this film. Don't listen to any bad reviews."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10339052/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Best Sellers, if you read between the lines ","With a little good will it's actually easy to see much more in this gem of a movie than most critics saw. It's about a generation who left little to the subsequent ones and the younger generation discovering that there is a lot more inner wealth in that locked-up chest than the bitterness the older generation was hiding behind.The start of the movie misleads you into thinking this is going to be formulaic. In the middle you worry that it may be sagging, or losing its way, when in fact that's just the changing wind and the gathering clouds. But there's a rainbow after the storm.I'm glad I watched it."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10339052/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt"," It's very bad ","First of all, this is like a lot of modern movies that feel very "long" despite not a lot of content. Modern movies, not unlike streaming series seem to cover a lot of running length, merely as a matter of convention or because it's there. It's never like there is actually enough material to require so much time.More specifically, this is a movie where the writer seems to think, because it concerns itself with a smart or "sophisticated" subject matter, it can otherwise be as routine or conventional as possible.Michael Caine's author character is given a lot crude vulgarity in order to seem cool and deep. The other dialogue is pandering to an internet audience and often feels like a redditor or whatever trying to sound smart.Aubrey Plaza is acting her butt off in another serious role, and it deserves acknowledgment. (I think she should be given a role where she isn't always in deep depression.) Michael Caine also does a good job at playing his role and dialogue as straight and with has much conviction as possible, which doesn't help make his character any less farcical."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10339052/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Watched it for Caines sake. ","The music was beautiful, Caines acting was brilliant as always, cant say the same thing for the main heroine. She overused her mimics."

Actors like Michael Caine are a disappearing breed so enjoy it while you can."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10339052/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," A NINE! Solely carried by the powerhouse that is Michael Caine ","He might as well have been all by himself, with simple puppeteering to support him. Might even have been stronger an effect but possibly too theatrical for a movie.Ik don't care how mediocre (it really wasn't, but thats what I read here and there) the storyline is. It is a human interaction, a story trying to display real people, no matter how imaginary. And when most of the actors get a passing grade for Hallmark level performances, Michael Caine was riveting, in your face, real! The entire movie depended on his availability to pull along an entire cast of unintented parodies of actors who couldn't find the right line if they tripped over it. But all that doenst matter! Just strap in for a ride of your life with a man who can do nothing else than excel in his job, portraying emotions, telling stories, making characters come to life. I haven't checked how old he is, but clearly that doesnt matter either.I was glued to my seat the entire time, and even despite the Hallmark ending, bells and whistles and everything, you will take that for granted as a soft landing out of an emotional and epic homerun by Michael Caine. Sit back and enjoy, in awe of some of the greats we are still surrounded by and who grant us their time and effort to tell stories their way, the only way. Damn. It was really that good. Trust me."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10339052/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," Classic Caine ","This is a classic. Michael Caine is on fire all the way throughout and even manages to almost get a couple of old lines in.Aubrey Plaza also gives an outstanding performance.The plot is solid, the pace is just right, the dialogue is perfect. At times funny, at times sad, this will not leave you unmoved.Easily one of the best films of 2021."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10339052/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," Michael Caine is a world treasure ","Michael Caine makes it all seem so natural and beautiful. And Plaza is like the cherry on top, she's always at her best."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10339052/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," Let's Not Exaggerate Its Value ","I love Michael Caine, but, this is simply not a good vehicle, script-wise. It takes itself far too seriously "comedy-wise." There is one ridiculous scene, which I certainly won't give away, but, has a touch of arson. It's beyond silly. Michael, unfortunately, doesn't have many performances left obviously due to his age. I'm sure he's grateful to be working, regardless of his immense abilities. I stuck with it until the end, but, I was deeply disappointed. Aubrey Plaza seems miscast to me. Other characters are stereotypical."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10339052/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Very sweet movie but soiled by ads ","Very sweet movie, and also sad to see McCain so old to be honest. Brilliant actor. Unfortunately the bright and obnoxious Apple ads hurt this movie as well.."

And the gags are unbelievably weak and often trivial as they've never been in all his previous films.I can't believe that Verdone could be even partially satisfied of the final result. A false step, really."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10341034/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Thin inflated plot ","I was disapointed, the story feels artificial, the twists seem forced. Twists for the sake of twists.This is a piece of work rather than a work of art.This morning I was asking myself, why that (thin) love scene?To me the answer is, it's like the rest, forced.And it's long.But, of course, by actual Netflix standards this movie is good."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10341034/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Breath taking ","An impressive thriller with a remarkable performance by Pierre Niney, the pace is breathtaking, the production filled with good ideas.This Film has nothing to envy to the English or American thriller, while having a very French and identifiable touch."

I did not see the time pass by. Plot was fascinating and also scary - Most people are afraid of plane crashes and is a delicate subject to treat which has been brilliantly handled in this movie.Pierre Niney also performing really well in this role.Great fresh piece of French cinema."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10342228/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","3"," Narco Sub ","This film looks promising for the first few minutes when two American teens are kidnapped for an obvious purpose, but after that it loses its way. As ever when undercover police and other agencies get involved in drug dealing and such, the plot can become confusing, and it does so here. Leaving all that aside, would a cartel or anyone consider running drugs into the US using a submarine when common or garden boats, planes and motor vehicles can be used just as effectively, especially if coupled with the strategic bribing of officials? Added to its implausibility is the bizarre ending. The best advice that can be given here is don't do drugs, and don't watch films about them, at least not films like this one."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10342228/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," This guy like reminds me 'Don't mess with the Zohan' ","His acting is great, everything else was made also very well in the movie, u won't find a better move at 2021 so you might as well try this one, budget on this was not a joke either, ignore the reviews, watch the trailer or watch the film after 1 hour things get even crazier."

Simple.I want to watch a fun movie, then get back to work without over-thinking it. . .This movie allows me to do that.This is a fun film that let's the audience escape for a couple of hours. Tom Sizemore, Lee Majors, Robert Lasardo, and Tom Vera do a great job keeping my attention in Narco Sub.I really love "indie" films, but it's getting harder and harder to tell them apart from Hollywood productions. Director, Shawn Welling does a good job to get natural performances from the actors.One great aspect about this movie is how they are bringing it to cinemas before the actual release date of September 10, 2021. The team at Deepwater Productions has teamed up with VetTix and other Cinema partners to bring Free screenings of Narco Sub to military and veteran families.Lucas Cinemas in Fort Benning, Georgia offered free popcorn and soda, combined with free tickets and a free t-shirt offer on July 31st, 2021.This is a huge value for the people on the base."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10342228/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Glad to know about Stryker ","This one is really good with a storyline. The film starts off with a family affair and then goes to drugs for "one hell of a ride" for Bruce, his family, the DEA and CIA - or so the narration tells us. The journey from where they start and where they end is completely amazing but not complete.You will feel satisfied with a fresh ending or left out to dry in angst - depending on how you like your films served and how well you pay attention to Tom Sizemore's sleepless narration - which was fitting and perfect.The complexity of the film is particularly challenging.I am not up for a challenge when I watch a film, i just want to have fun. With that said company at hand loves this kinda of gold digging. So with my shaken side fellow film watchers - i was kept in the loop.The acting level in this series is just damn great for an indie film and everyone including the Kids have acted exactly on point. No over acting no unnecessary drama but just simply blending into the characters of the story.I don't care about the so-called trivia pointed out by others concerning this film. To me, they make no difference whatsoever to the enjoyment of this movie.But there is one slip-up I do "kind of" mind. For this kinda of budget I would like to have seen more extras. However there was one or two wides with a meaty group.A well cooked piece of story telling with solid characters that make you invest in them and the story."

He kills like its a sport and has questionable morals as any cartel thug would (such as being willing to smuggle drugs and girls with zero remorse) but beyond that you will find the "bad guy" here to be as smart and cunning as John Doe in Se7en.Some smoothing out left to do but great characters and film making."

They're assigned a strange case of a dead body in the subway.Chris Rock has been trying to act hard in a few roles recently. Some comedians can pull that off especially as they get older. All I think is that this is an unfunny Chris and it's weird. This is his acting face and it's fake. I try to image him without his past greatness and I can't do it. As for the movie, this is a lot of Saw essentials; overly complicated kills and morality lessons. The complicated tests are getting repetitive after almost two decades of Saw movies. I actually like the self-righteous morality in this one. The reveal is fine although it's somewhat expected coming from this franchise. Quite frankly, I wonder if this would be better if Sam Jackson takes the lead role."

Basically, at a Fourth of July parade, off-duty cop Detective Marv 'Boz' Boswick (Dan Petronijevic) chases a thief down a sewer drainage pipe. He is attacked from behind by a figure wearing a pig mask, and wakes to find himself suspended by his tongue in a trap above a subway tunnel. On a television screen plays a recorded message from someone wearing the pig mask with a distorted voice, telling him he has a choice: tear out his tongue that and live, or be hit and killed by the oncoming train. Boswick is unable to escape in time and is hit and killed by the train. The next day, police Captain Angie Garza (Marisol Nichols) assigns Detective Ezekiel "Zeke" Banks (Chris Rock, also producing) a new partner, idealistic rookie William Schenk (The Handmaid's Tale's Max Minghella). Banks and Schenk investigate Boswick's death, seeing the cirmstances of the officer's death, and a red spiral spray painted on the wall, Banks believes the crime to be inspired by now deceased Jigsaw Killer, aka John Kramer. Meanwhile, homicide Detective Fitch (Richard Zeppieri) is abducted and placed in a trap where he must rip his fingers off to avoid electrocution in a filling water basin; he also fails to escape and dies. Several years ago, Fitch ignored a backup call from Banks, resulting in him nearly getting killed. Some officers begin to suspect that Banks may be responsible, due to his history with Fitch. A box then arrives at the station, containing a pig puppet and a piece of Schenk's tattooed skin inside. A small vial inside the box directs the police to a butcher shop, which was previously a hobby shop that Banks and his father, retired chief Marcus Banks (Samuel L. Jackson), would go to. Upon arriving, the team discovers a tape recorder and the skinned corpse of Schenk. Deciding to track down the killer himself, Marcus travels to a warehouse, where he is abducted. Shortly afterwards, Garza is kidnapped, and placed in a trap in the precinct's cold storage where she must sever her spinal cord on a blade to stop hot wax flowing from a pipe onto her face. She manages to successfully sever her spine but dies of her injuries, with Banks finding her body. Following a lead, Banks is captured and wakes up handcuffed to a pipe in the warehouse with a hacksaw nearby. He considers sawing off his arm but manages to escape using a loose bobby pin. He then discovers Pete Dunleavy (Patrick McManus), his former partner who was fired when Banks exposed a murder he committed, chained in place. A large glass-crushing machine has been modified to hurl shrapnel at Pete at high speed; a tape recorder explains that Banks can choose to either free him or leave him to die. Although Banks tries to save Pete, he dies from blood loss. Moving to another room, Banks then finds Schenk, who is alive having faked his own death by using the skinned corpse of the thief who lured Boswick into the tunnels; he has been the copycat killer all along. He explains that he is really Billy Emerson, the son of the person Pete murdered, who was shot because he had agreed to testify against a dirty cop. He also reveals that Marcus, during his time as chief, deliberately protected corrupt officers, including Garza, to "clean" the streets of crime more efficiently. Emerson presents him with a final test to prove himself as a potential ally. Marcus is restrained in the air and slowly being drained of blood. Emerson calls 911 and claims that he is a civilian being pursued by a shooter, resulting in the dispatcher sending a SWAT team to his location. He hands Banks a gun with a single bullet and offers him a choice, to either shoot a target that will save Marcus but allow Emerson to escape, or to kill Emerson and let his father bleed to death. Banks decides to shoot the target to save Marcus, causing his restraints to loosen and lowering him to the ground. He fights with Emerson, and the SWAT team arrives. The SWAT tram inadvertently trigger a tripwire, causing Marcus to be yanked up, and a gun becomes affixed to his arm. The restraints and the gun are pulled upward, the SWAT mistake Marcus for a shooter and kill him. Banks screams in anguish as Emerson escapes. Also starring Ali Johnson as Officer Jeannie Lewis, Zoie Palmer as Kara Boswick, Dylan Roberts as Sergeant Morgey, K. C. Collins as Detective Drury, Edie Inksetter as Detective Kraus, Thomas Mitchell as Detective O'Brien, Carvin Winans as Officer Paul, Leila Leigh as Officer Mark, and Josh Stolberg as Police Officer. Rock proves himself as more than a comedian with a reasonable serious performance as the lead cop, Minghella is alright, and Jackson is an odd but interesting choice as the lead character's dad. This sequel is from the perspective of the authorities trying to catch the killer, Tobin Bell is nowhere to be seen (apart from some photos) as the culprit is a copycat, but it doesn't quite work. The traps and deaths are just as gruesome as the previous "torture porn" entries, but the film suffers from a lack of inventive twists, no scares, no thrills, and a predictable script, a pretty disappointing and boring horror. Okay!"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10342730/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," Clap-trap. ","It's quite apt that the the star of Spiral, the latest chapter in the 'Book of Saw', is stand-up comedian Chris Rock, because the film is a joke.Rock, dreadfully mis-cast, plays Detective Zeke Banks, who is the focus of a campaign of terror by a serial killer who seems to be emulating the infamous John Kramer AKA Jigsaw, only this time the victims are corrupt cops (how topical). Banks is sent parcels in the post by the new killer, leading him from one gruesome discovery to another.In the opening scene, the trap is situated above a subway line, the victim given the option of losing his tongue or losing his life. Did no-one making this film question the logic of installing a complex mechanical device above an operational railway line? How long would the device have taken to assemble? Did no trains pass by on those days? Was the third rail electrified the whole time? It's just plain dumb.......but not as dumb as the trap that the maniac somehow manages to assemble in a police evidence room. It pumps boiling wax onto the victims face, thus requiring a power supply and some heavy duty equipment, yet is installed without a hitch, no-one interrupting the (presumably noisy) work, and with no-body questioning the presence of such a device.And I gotta love the following scene for all the wrong reasons: Zeke picks the lock on his handcuffs using a hair pin and then protects himself from high velocity shards of glass using a dustbin. Firstly, picking a lock is not that simple - it can be done, but takes practice and time. Secondly, that bin ain't protecting him - there's glass flying everywhere, but that's okay... what's a few deep flesh-wounds to a tough guy like Zeke?The ill-considered script also holds very few surprises regarding the identity of the killer: as soon as Detective William Schenk was declared dead without showing how he was killed or why he was chosen, I knew I had my man. And sure enough... (one might say 'I SAW that coming').Lastly, what's up with the killer's puppet: not only does it look stupid, but it's got a really daft voice as well. Bring back Billy!3.5/10, generously rounded up to 4 for the finger-trap, which is undeniably nasty."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10342730/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," I felt obligated to watch this ","Last year, I watched every Saw film in a day or two and it's not an experience that I would wish on anyone. Well, seeing as how this had the lofty title of Spiral: From the Book of Saw and was directed by Darren Lynn Bousman, who also was behind Saw II, Saw III and Saw IV, I was for sure that I was going to hate every single moment of this.Guess what? I didn't!I mean, it's the best Saw movie I've seen and I still didn't love it, but it didn't make me continually look at how much time is left in the movie, which is a major improvement on past episodes in the franchise.Honestly, this movie could have been its own film and had nothing to do with Jigsaw or any of the past films and it would have been just fine on its own.This film got its start when Chris Rock met Lionsgate vice chairman Michael Burns at a wedding and decided that doing a horror film would be a new direction for him. He's right, but it's kind of like the entire film is Rock testing out his "I'm divorced now" material on the audience, which isn't all that bad, because I laughed at a lot of it, but I'm also not certain that the film should have been about Rock's "big divorce energy.*"Rock plays Det. Marv Bozwick, a man whose father - Samuel Jackson! - was a cop and when he finally became a cop himself, it turns out that everyone was dirty. Well, just from the opening, it seems like maybe Marv is on his way. Or maybe he's having too much fun playing a criminal. And hey, that scene is never brought back or discussed again.The idea that a copycat killer is cleaning up the police department is a good one, yet we're forced to feel sympathy for the kind of cops that have given the justice system the bad name that it currently lives under. There are about five minutes of actually trying to turn this into something interesting before people start getting hung up by their tongues, which is pretty much what this franchise is all about.The end of this was one of the weirdest edited mishmashes I've seen, more given to scattered imagery and flashes than showing what was really happening. It was like they realized they only had a few more feet of film - it's digital, guys - and just went with what they had. Or maybe this was shot during quarantine and they did the best they could.That said - the buddy cop aspects of this and where they go were interesting. And I'd much rather see where the Spiral and Mr. Snuggles the cop puppet turn up next than go back to the same story that the other films have mined more times than I thought was even necessary.Spiral is available in so many formats for your viewing pleasure: a 4K Ultra HD Combo Pack (plus Blu-ray and Digital), a blu-ray Combo Pack (plus DVD and Digital), DVD and Digital On Demand. You can get any of them wherever you choose to buy movies from Lionsgate. The physical media sets also include two commentary tracks: one with director Darren Lynn Bousman, co-screenwriter Josh Stolberg and composer Charlie Clouser and another with producers Oren Koules and Mark Burg.* G.

","Now ever since "Agora" (2009) i have had a tiny bit of a crush on Max Minghella - so I suspect i am being kinder to this bobbins than perhaps I would have been had he not starred here as "Shenk" alongside Chris Rock ("Zeke") and his on-screen pop "Banks" (Samuel L. Jackson). Perhaps on-screen flop would have been a better description, though to be fair SLJ features only as if he were on a daily rate and the budget was frugal... It has a lot of "Se7en" (1995) about it - two cops, one a rookie, investigating a series of grisly homicides that, in this case, bear a striking resemblance to some previous serial killings - and the killer is leaving tantalising breadcrumbs for them to follow. Sadly, though, as the plot nears the sharp end, it falls foul of some frankly ridiculous twists the culminate in an almost risibly silly ending. Rock tries hard, too hard, and the script is banal with little characterisation to make you - or keep you - remotely interested in what's happening to whom. Straight to streaming, I'd have said..."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10342730/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," OK ","Zeke is a police detective, ostracised by his colleagues for turning in a fellow cop who shot an unarmed man but lied about it. He is given a case, the murder of a fellow cop which appears to be a Jigsaw copycat killer. And it is the first of a series of killings which may have connections to when Zeke's dad was police chief.This movie undoubtedly uses the Saw trademark of presenting the guilty with the possibility of choosing redemption by way of self-inflicted extreme violence, but it does it in the context of a decent story. It's not an unfamiliar story, and I was able to guess the two suprises without too much trouble. But it's still a better story that the Saw series ended up with.The casting was a surprise. Chris Rock was rather good, Isle of Wighter Max Minghella is second banana, and Samuel L Jackson collects a paycheque."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10342730/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," If Only Chris Rock's Character Stayed in Character ","From the vaults of the "Saw" franchise is "Spiral" starring Chris Rock. This movie had a strong start. There was a gruesome Jigsaw style killing to begin with and Chris Rock was hilarious as the surly, yet honest Detective Zeke Banks. He played a very stereotypical loner cop who was indignant when he was assigned a partner, but it was forgivable because he was so funny.As the movie settled into the gory murder mystery that "Saw" is known to be, Chris Rock's character changed as well. He was far less funny which made him also less believable as a tough metro city cop who's face became congealed into a permanent mean mug. Chris Rock is not a mean mug kinda guy.The nameless faceless killer in Jigsaw's stead was killing dirty cops. I gotta tell ya, it was hard to hate a killer who was targeting criminals with a badge. Sure, his methods were brutal and sadistic, but his heart was in the right place.The movie seemed to be on overdrive the last two-thirds of it. Chris Rock was bouncing from place to place and receiving one package after another without there being any real sense of time. Things were happening so fast the gravity of it all never got a chance to sink in. I liked the premise, I just would have preferred Chris Rock's character to have stayed in character."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10342730/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," My return visit to the cinema. ","With cinemas having recently re-opened in the UK, I've been trying to decide what would be the first title I would see on the big screen. Marking the re-opening of cinemas in 2020 by going to see the wonderful The Vigil (2019-also reviewed)I decided to stay in Horror, and pick up the latest piece of the Jigsaw puzzle.View on the film:The driving force of this entry after he met the head of the studio at a mutual friends wedding in Brazil, Chris Rock gives a very good performance as cop Zeke Banks (Zeke being the shorten version of "Ezekiel"- 25:17:"The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides By the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men.") thanks to Rock using his comedian persona to give Zeke a wisecracking confident swagger, which Rock chips away to reveal blistering terror at the jigsaw pieces coming into play.Storming in to take on the psycho, Samuel (yel) L Jackson gives a delightfully bombastic turn, with him visibly enjoying the snappy exchanges with Rock,and yelling at the killer to just bring it.Ending the title with a Trap track (Get it?) Darren Lynn Bousman returns to the franchise with cinematographer Jordan Oram making his non-TV/shorts debut, and unleashes the signature sped-up panning shots and rapid-fire edits on the chewy gory set-pieces.Whilst continuing the splatter of the past flicks, Bousman & Oram perform a successful reboot that slides the flick onto Thriller tracks, via stylish extended takes tracking shots gliding next to Zeke trying to pull out secrets from fellow cops,as another trap pulls out a jaw.Going right back to the morality motivation Jigsaw had used in early Saw flicks, the screenplay by the returning Josh Stolberg and Pete Goldfinger skewer the ruthless murders with vicious police corruption thrills,that spiral into a sharp twist ending,where on the path to find the killer, Zeke finds himself beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10342730/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","3"," Barely watchable franchise reboot ","Assigned to be partners together, cops who don't like each other find themselves as the latest to investigate a series of killings that are reminiscent of the original Jigsaw killings years earlier, and the closer they get to the truth find themselves the next potential targets to be caught inThis was a rather disappointing and unremarkable genre entry. Like most franchise efforts, this one only works with the brutality and graphicness of the traps the victims find themselves fallen into. Keeping more of a recent trend where the overall goal of the traps isn't truly about getting out of them to learn a lesson but more of just cruel and graphic methods of dismembering people, there's a rather brutal and unfair nature to the traps featured that makes the expected results at the end rather fun and impressive. With traps featuring one victim with his tongue stuck in a contraption and being forced to remove himself by tearing off his tongue before being hit by a train, another with his fingers tied together and forced to extricate himself before the fingers are all ripped off and then another is forced under a hox-wax dispenser and is forced to sever their spinal column to keep the wax from dripping onto their face among even more traps. This is a fun aspect of the film and really serves as the best factor here as the brutality present here serves this well enough. There are a few major issues with this one. The main problem is that we're being forced to stay on this one cop for most of the investigation, which is completely unrealistic or appropriate. The fact that this is a personal vendetta on several fronts, namely his history with the other officers on the force for his past behavior bringing down the corrupt officer to his struggles staying out of his father's shadow, creates a big issue of why he's even involved in the case, to begin with. Given the personal matters already, the revelations about the victims being cops tied to him creates a major conflict of interest that would make it highly unlikely he would be allowed onto it which only serves to highlight how unappealing he is as a pretty unimpressive lead. Brash, loud, arrogant to every bit of help he gets, and determined to do it alone regardless of how out of his element he is. This really makes it hard to follow him throughout the investigation. Sill, what makes the investigation even harder to follow is how underwhelming and uninspired it really is. The whole concept of the killer's identity being a mystery to figure out is a complete joke with the idea being telegraphed from the moment the character appears on-screen and we get their initial interactions with other characters in a manner that highlights who they'll become later on. As well, the amount of time spent on trying to figure this out from the clues left at the crime scenes or the interactions on the police force comes off with the intensity of a police procedural series on a random television show, barely taking hunches or guesswork and essentially just being lucky that what he's doing with strange objects in the station or other pieces of technology aren't corrupting the system like they easily could've. To hand this off at the expense of traps or anything else relegated to the franchise's past is a major factor when it's barely focused on these traps, all of which hold this one down the most.Rated R: Extreme Graphic Violence and Extreme Graphic Language."

I mean, what has this to do with the Saw franchise?I see that some countries it was only called Spiral, that would have been better. Okay, there are a lot of traps made like in the Saw franchise so they would say, hey, it's a rip-off on that part I do understand the title. But on the other hand, Kramer is referred to sometimes so okay, we hav a Saw connection...and the doll is here....the pigs...the gore..There's a lot of gore, that's a fact. Honet, the reason it was made is that Chris Rock was a huge fan of Saw and so he was able to produce it and take the lead.Was it bad, no not at all, predictable, therefor i was fooled so no not at all.

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10342730/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt"," The Saw series has now officially spiraled out of control. ","When I teach intro to film again, I will use Spiral (subtitled "From the Book of Saw") as an example of thriller and revenge themes coupled with torture porn. At least I know the Gitmo operatives will enjoy it. But like that real life torture chamber, the Saw series just won't quit.Nothing is creative about the formulaic nature of the film although the father/son dynamic gives it a bid for the unusual. As for the torture, the Saw series (this in the 9th?) has been exemplary for creative variations of torture.Most especially this iteration with the Dantean punishments fitting the crime. One ring of this hell, for instance, has the cop victim losing his tongue most horrifically for having lied regularly on the stand. In another, a victim can bypass electrocution in a tub by allowing a machine to rip off his fingers!The Jigsaw copycat certainly has Jigsaw's flare for the macabre while Chris Rock playing homicide detective Zeke Banks underperforms as the only decent cop in sight heading the investigation into the sick murders of the men and women in blue. Samuel L. Jackson as his dad and former chief of police is just Jackson reprising his bad-ass persona from a hundred other movies.After absorbing the variations of torture, you might notice this is just a conventional and unremarkable police-as-corrupt thriller. But then, Rock is a producer, so like the Jigsaw imitator, he allows the series to live again. Or die, if I can predict the drift of critical reviews."

Then we delve into the new tone if the movie, which i also liked. Same with the chris rock comedy. The setup was good, and the story was intriguing.But it did not culminate into anything of note and ranged from mediocre to disappointing for the second half of the movie. The traps were okay, and i feel like there were only four of them. And to make it worse, for two of them they let you know the player didn't survive before showing you the trap, which defeats the purpose and removes the tension.All in all, i liked the idea and the new tone, and i didn't have a bad time with the movie. I will probably give it another chance. And i would be curious to see a continuation of the story. But imo, this is worse than any of the original 7, and on par with jigsaw (part 8). And this is almost exactly what i said about jigsaw (1 viewing, 5/14/2021)SPOILERSthe most disappointing part about this movie is that i guessed the reveal. Guess isn't the right word. I knew who the killer was at about the halfway point and never waivered after that. This has never happened to me with any of the previous 8 movies, even sometimes on second viewing. Maybe it's more difficult to surprise a seasoned fan of the series. But that argument can't be used when the first 8 repeatedly surprised me. And it wasn't even clever."

It was cool seeing Marcus strung up like a puppet and then a gun barrel shoots out his arm. And you pretty much could guess whom was behind jigsaw from the beginning.FINAL VERDICT: Definitely a spin off that didn't need to be made.

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10342730/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt"," More A Rebranding Than A Resurrection ","More a rebranding than a resurrection of the Saw franchise, Spiral: From the Book of Saw is an attempt to steer the series in a new direction by revamping it from the ground up while retaining the essence of the infamous saga. John Kramer's legacy lives on in those booby traps & visceral kills but it isn't the driving force of this story as this latest entry is all about forging a new identity instead of serving as a follow-up chapter.Directed by Darren Lynn Bousman (Saw II, Saw III & Saw IV), there's a freshness in its approach but it doesn't take long for the film to fall into those same trappings that its predecessors did. The premise is no doubt interesting but the execution leaves a lot to be desired, for more could've been done with it. Chris Rock plays Chris Rock and isn't convincing in his detective role. Samuel L. Jackson only has a cameo. And the killer's identity is no surprise.On the plus side, this looks definitely more polished & sophisticated than preceding entries, plus it tries to return to the basics by dialling down on violence & gore while ratcheting up the tension & suspense. It digs into the police corruption theme but in an uninspiring & half-hearted manner and just fails to realise what was up for grabs here. There are a few interesting traps & gruesome deaths that will delight the fans, but nothing that leaves behind a lasting impression.Overall, Spiral: From the Book of Saw had potential it never truly taps into and is far from the reinvention it was hoping to be. While the film falls short on the expectation scale, it still does enough to warrant a sequel and it would be interesting to see how things pan out from here. But the void left behind by Tobin Bell is too big for anyone to fill and the killer in this one is simply no match. Failing to bring the franchise back into relevance, this ninth instalment is still better than half of its predecessors and is worth a shot."

I never was a big fan of series, but i liked first movie and as far as i remember second was not bad either. "Spiral" is not the worst not the best of them - its just another entry into "Saw" series trying to revive it and milk it again, this time by Chris Rock.Overall, "Spiral" is more or less the same movie you saw many times if you watched previous movies.

Side note: How is that armed & trained police can not hear someone walk up to them (some in very open spaces) & also be subdued by that smaller person? Script lacked forensics, but I guess that didn't matter. Acting, very rote by-the-books. Too much screen time filled with departmental arguing & antagonisms & the "f" word to make cops seem tough."

The direction which was made by Darren Lynn Bousman, it was good and I believe that he did an excellent job on the way he used the information from the old "Saw" movies. The interpretation of Chris Rock who played as Detective Zeke Banks was very good and I enjoyed watching Chris Rock playing on such a different role. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Max Minghella's who played as Detective William Schenk and Marisol Nichols who played as Captain Angie Garza.

","4 out of 5 stars.Spiral is a good horror thriller film that makes it the ninth film in the series. And still being fresh with the ideas of creating another. This sequel is different. Just like how Jigsaw movie was. The concept feels like a crime solving detective film which has Chris Rock following several grisly murders that are caught as victims to the next jigsaw traps. But how are all these victims connected? And what is jigsaw motives behind all these murders? The plot is good. Has a theme which what the killers motives are. About corrupt cops and dishonesty. There is a twist in the end which is a fun surprise to the final few mins.The film is less gory and has less torture scenes than the earlier Saw films. Spiral is still brutal and has intense gory scenes with its few it does have. Some may leave you cringing. It does have some intense sequences.The cast ensemble is good. Chris Rock taking on a more serious role as a burnt out officer. Samuel L. Jackson playing his father. And others were good with the roles as well.The direction is a little fresh take with the franchise. Which still leaves room for more.One thing that could have improved is the script. The writing is terrible with horrible dialogue."

Jackson as his retired police chief father Marcus Banks, Rock's move to establish himself as a leading man outside of comedic affairs is a fairly poor attempt to subvert expectations and while those who saw the most recent season of Fargo can attest to his ability to be more than the loud-mouthed funny guy, Rock often looks out of place and feels out of place as a hard nosed detective that is in over his head.With all said and done and when the blood stops flowing come the 21 Savage backed credits, Spiral isn't a complete failure and there's a pulse for a future under this new directive but its not enough to save a forgettable film from being mostly pointless as a standalone effort.Final Say -Unlikely to appease long-term Saw fans and only passable as a film judged on its own merit, Spiral is far from the worst film under the Saw banner but its potential is mostly lost in a film that fails to make its own mark.2 parcel delivery guys out of 5."

The supporting actors are mediocre, but worse, the 2 great actors Chris Rock and Samuel L Jackson act below par as well. The dialogues and the story are simply boring and full of the usual cop cliches we have seen a zillion times before.More bad: there is no real suspense. There are no jokes either. The action / horror is cheap and only used to cover up that this movie is boring from start to finish.This movie is made without any soul or originality.

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10342730/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," Rock Paper Scissors. ",""Spiral" is the best film I've seen at the cinema this year.... It's also the only film I've seen at the cinema this year. With the Covid restrictions finally lifted enough to allow Cinemas in the UK to reopen, the first film that we were able to see was this spinoff from the "Saw" franchise, one I must admit, I stopped checking in on somewhere around the second sequel. Thrilled as I was to be back sat in the dark, "Spiral" has more than enough flaws to dampen anyone's enthusiasm.Detective Banks (Chris Rock) has spent years castigated and isolated from the rest of his department, for testifying against his partner, who had shot and killed a witness. He reluctantly accepts a new partner, Detective Schenk (Max Minghella), a rookie, fresh out the academy, just as he lands a new case. The case is the murder of another Detective, one which bares striking resemblance to the gruesome Jigsaw murders, from years earlier.There are, for my money, two things wrong with "Spiral". One perhaps is a matter of personal taste. I like Chris Rock. As a standup he is truly legendary. But the character he plays here requires far more nuance and craft that he's able to provide. In the opening scene, where he has to crack wise about "Forest Gump" he's perfectly cast, but later in the film, as the case starts to hit closer to home and risk people he cares about, all he has is shouting. The film itself doesn't appear to have any faith in him, so regularly intercuts images of Banks "silent screaming" in scenes, in an attempt to get any display of emotion across.Far more damning though, is that the story isn't very clever. Anyone who gives it an ounce of thought will work out exactly who is behind it, and why, well before it's revealed. For a series that has been proud of its truly inventive twists in the past, it's very disappointing. As well as having no faith in its star, the film has little faith in its audience too, so has it's first reminder flashback to something you've already seen, only twenty minutes in.It's not abjectly terrible. If you are into the traps and gore of the franchise that is all solid stuff, even inventive at times. The rushed ending points to sequels that I'd probably go back for but it's really not a good film."

So how do you prove that in court?

Now, that family's demons are about to meet very real ones.Adam Ethan Crow has some interesting ideas in here and it feels like this inhabits the same world as The Conjuring films while having a more progressive family at its center. While Steven and Ben have been faking ghost incidents for years, the air bob filled with occult objects actually begins to show them what the unknown really is.Steven is as repellant a character as you'll find, his plan is one made to unravel and woe be to the normal family caught within.

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10350204/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Kind Hearted Family Aussie Film! ","Ridley (Milan Burch) is dealing with the loss of his father, who died one year ago as a hero while saving three people. His mother, Gloria (Victoria Hill), decides to leave New York and move to Western Australia, where the two can start fresh and live with Ridley's grandfather, Spencer (Bill Nighy). Naturally, Ridley would prefer to keep to himself and has no interest in the big move or connecting with his unknown grandfather Spencer.Upon meeting, Spencer gives the appearance of being an old and grumpy man. Still, overall, he is relatively kind towards Ridley and wishes to help him adjust to his new lifestyle in the outback, even offering to take him camping. Spencer also gives a warning of the dangers to Ridley, explaining to him about nearby Dingos. Ridley is put off by his support.One night, while Ridley and Spencer are camping in the outback, the two have a disagreement, and Ridley walks away. Soon, he finds a wounded Dingo stuck in a trap. Ridley frees the dingo, and the two share an unlikely moment. Unfortunately, the dingo runs away into the night, and later, both Ridley and Spencer go home. The following day, however, Spencer finds Ridley has disappeared and possibly run away from home. Now Ridley is lost in the outback and reunited with the same dingo he just saved. Together they hope to escape and survive the dangers of the outback while Spencer and Ridley's mother begin their search.Buckley's Chance is best classed as an Australian family film with little moments of heartfelt drama. The film is filled with great messages and positive vibes right from the opening. There are also attempts at humour along the way, primarily thanks to the film's dim-witted bad guys.Performances are wonderful. Bill Nighy once again proves, as always, that he is a stunning actor (seriously, Bill, call me, let's catch up for a coffee!). The acting debut of Milan Burch, who plays the leading role of Ridley, was most undoubtedly impressive and pleasing to see. Based on the young actor's work here, I am confident we will see more of him in films to come.The film's music and soundtrack score were rather touching and pleasing throughout the duration, with only a couple of minor moments felt overdramatic compared to what was on-screen. Side performances from Victoria Hill and Kelton Pell were also great. There were no significant concerns with the film other than, as already stated, the bad guys who I found far too silly. Again, this is a family drama film and somewhat to be expected. The opening, which introduces the character of Spencer, was also questionable, and I felt this introduction could have been far more impacting. Still, thankfully this was forgivable as the film progressed.Overall, I had a wonderful time watching this film. It's a touching, adventurous, and light-hearted story filled with positive messages about overcoming hurts, surviving, and, most importantly, family. The performance from Bill Nighy is brilliant, along with newcomer Milan Burch who also leaves a positive impression. This is undoubtedly an Australian film worth supporting as it reminds the world that even when you're feeling lost, you are never truly alone.7.4/10 - Walkden Entertainment."

He is British, he sounds British, yet he's supposed to be an Aussie in this? There was no explanation around this. Secondly, why has his American daughter in law and grandson moved to the middle of the outback?? This movie was so frustrating as it raised more questions than it answered - and the answers it did provide were weak and didn't make sense. The storyline (if you can call it that) was uneventful and boring. I didn't laugh, I didn't cry and I wasn't gripping the edge of my seat. My parents and I watched it together and we were all very disappointed. It felt like it was trying to be another "Red Dog" - but a bad, un-funny version."

I can forgive bad accents, even bad acting but I cannot forgive the script. It seems the script writers used Lassie come home as a template for part of the movie. The dialogue is riddled with Americanisms that one would not find in the outback. Perpetrates myths about our dangerous fauna. Brown snakes are not aggressive, dingoes will not attack you (yes baby Azaria was taken by a Dingo but they will not attack people unless it is for an easy feed.) It is not even true to the geography - part of the action is supposed to take place in central Australia but we find that we are in walking distance of a great river.Should we really be perpetuating myths such as these? Is this shot for an American audience and so it needs to appeal to their myths about how the west was won?Films are fiction but they do have a responsibility for accuracy."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10355058/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Relatable Message, An Interesting Storyline, And Shows The Importance Of Teamwork. ","Secret Agent Dingledorf and His Trusty Dog Splat is a film that has a relatable message, an interesting storyline, and shows the importance of teamwork. There are some familiar faces in this film, making it one to watch.The story follows a 10-year-old boy named Bernie Dingledorf (Zackary Arthur) who is living a normal life, until he and his friends eat a Gooey Chewy Bar. This makes the friends immune to the Laugh Generator, which is being used by Dr. Chuckles, a clown who is trying to take over the world through uncontrollable laughter. When a secret spy agency called T. W. I. T. forces Bernie and his friends to come together to save the world from Dr. Chuckles, it is up to them to step up to the plate.The acting in this film is not great, but it's acceptable. The sets are very colorful and creative. At some points you can tell they are using a green screen such as when we see the T. W. I. T. agency behind the characters - the setting looks like it has been edited. My favorite aspect is the storyline, which is entertaining and fun. Throughout the movie we see Berinie and his friends go on an adventure to figure out how to stop the clowns from creating world-wide havoc, which can be a fun, exciting, adventure for the audience. My favorite character is IQ (Cooper J. Friedman) because he's really funny. Although IQ is small, he is a big help in stopping the clowns. The others think that just because he is small, he doesn't know much and is small-brained. But, I like the fact that he is really just as smart as the others.The message of this film is that it doesn't matter who you are or what you do, God doesn't make junk. This film is completely family friendly.I rate Secret Agent Dingledorf and His Trusty Dog Splat 3 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 6 to 8. You can find this film on VOD starting September 30, 2021. Be sure to check it out.By Giana N., KIDS FIRST!"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10355058/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," Think this is a film that anyone can enjoy. ","This is a movie with a lot of heart! To start I got to give props for the cast and crew. This is the kind of film that anyone can enjoy, I know it is mainly targeted for kids due to being based on the book series of the same name, but adults can enjoy and get a good message out of it too. This film contains a message about kindness and bullying. Think kids today can really learn a valuable lesson after watching it.I'm going to do my best to keep this spoiler free as much as possible, mostly just detail some things on the way the movie starts out.The film follows Bernie Dingledorf played by Zackary Arthur, IQ played by Cooper J. Friedman, Lens Cap played by Shiloh Nelson, and Splat played by Tupac Souza. Bernie, IQ and Lens Cap are filming their own superhero movie, when a group of bullies confront them and end up sabotaging it. This causes Bernie to get depressed for not being able to stand up to those bullies and protect his friends as well.In another part of town there is a group of clowns going around robbing stores for a candy bar called "Gooey Chewy Bar", that got sent to the wrong addresses by mistake. The leader of the clowns, Dr. Chuckles who is played by Ryan O'Quinn is developing a plan to take over the world, with an invention of his own creation that causes laughter and makes people play mean pranks on one another. Anyone that eats the candy bar is immune to the affects of it, which Bernie and his friends ends up getting enough for them after a crate of the candy bars falls out of the clowns truck, following the encounter with the bullies..This is where an secret agent Agent 001/2 who is played by Paul Johansson is assigned to find Bernie and his friends. They may be the only ones able to stop Dr. Chuckles from completing his diabolical plan.This sets the foundation of the film, leading Bernie, his friends and others on a silly humorous ride of unpredictable moments.Some other mentionable things about the film is that it has a very special actress in it too, Darcy Donavan. You may have seen Darcy in films and shows like Anchorman, Parks and Recreation, Modern Family, and My Name is Earl, to name a few of her works. She plays Agent 001/2's love interest in the film. There is one of her scenes where Agent 001/2 is trying to hide her from his boss, who discusses the mission to him. It made me really burst out laughing.I also wanted to give props to both Billy Dickson the director and Bill Myers the writer, for bringing this movie together and putting the kind of effort in the film that makes you want to go and pay it forward to someone after watching it. It has that kind of ripple effect about it, of positivity. Also mentioning Bill again another fun part of the film is seeing him appear in parts of it as little cameos/easter eggs.As a final message on why I think you all should watch this film, besides just the good message about the film, there is a lot of heart, humor and silliness within it too. With the way things has been this year and last year with the pandemic and quarentine, this is the kind of family movie that can bring out your inner child and make you feel like a kid again. Its also a family movie that anyone can enjoy watching. God knows we can all use a few laughs right now, and this movie certainly delivers on that! Give it a chance, you will not be disappointed!"

However, the movie shows how harsh things became for the Jews with the Invasion and how terrible was to suddenly know that friends and people you knew either disappeared in hiding or where deported. Those that mention that is a lot of talking don't seem to get the drama of all as well as what has been proved that Anne was in fact a not easy child and even rebel.

The film is told through the eyes of Hannah, Anne Frank's best friend. You see two teenagers who try to hold their own under sometimes difficult circumstances. It is a film that does not make us forget what happens when one group oppresses another. An absolute must see."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10364272/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," It was pretty good ","I didn't know what to expect when watching this. Needless to say, it was pretty good. I enjoyed it. I liked the main characters. They worked pretty well off each other. I actually thought Jordan wouldn't reveal her true identity in the end, but she did. Stacey Lacey certainly has the look and attitude to play an alien (not to be rude). Sometimes her delivery and expressions do come off as sinister at times ,though. I have to admit, David was a jerk throughout the movie. I understand most of where it came from: his relationship with his dad was very strained after his wife passed on. That's understandable, and to be fair, he does try to make up for his mistakes. Both of them do. It's nice to see his dad pick himself back up, given how low he let himself get to.The story's a simple one. There's no fight scene or grand scheme of things. It's just an alien exploring earth and interacting with some of the locals. One of whom she falls in love with. That someone turns out to be scientists whom she helps with his project.It's actually amazing how he doesn't realize that there's an alien right in front of him - despite the not so subtle signs such as the clothes she wears. It's almost frustrating. Speaking of which, I thought the black dress, green knit cap, and the leggings looked good. Really helped drive the point across that she obviously wasn't from here and that she was different.The conspiracy theorist was a decent antagonist. Not evil, just creepy and obsessive. I won't give away his fate, but let's just say it actually works in his favor.Alienated is a light-hearted a sci-fi movie. It's not loud or flashy, but rather quiet and laid back. Some the edits are abrupt and I do wish Jordan met David's dad as she hoped for earlier. On the other hand, I loved the ending. I'm glad he went with her. In most movies, it's the opposite.I know this probably won't happen, but if there's by any chance a sequel. I'd love to see it. I would love to see David interact with Jordan's mom. You could do so much with that idea.So yeah, this's a good movie. One I recommend if you like female aliens and rom-coms. Now that I think about it, we really need more movies with female aliens - it's always dudes.Anyway, get beamed up and see for yourself."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10364272/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Quite unexpectedly good ride ","At first this appears to be a B-class alien movie. Then it appears to be a B-class romance movie. But the longer it goes on, the more interesting it becomes. By the time it gets to the science part-- FOR ONCE the writers offer a hypothesis that at least makes sense from a science / fiction viewpoint. That in itself was impressive, because it wasn't stupid. Such a well-thought-out, uncontrived plot element is very unusual in this type of film. I suspect they took this from established quantum physics theory; it is just too good to be a random story point.Some of the acting is cornball, but still fun and tolerable. The real clincher / winner is the last 15 minutes of the movie, which likely could not have been better written or directed. This is often where a movie falls short; those last minutes can make or break a film. Fortunately for this one, it makes the film in a large way, and turns what might have been a UFO turkey into an unusually enjoyable winner.This is one of those rare low-budget sleeper flicks that is well worth watching."

The cinematography is bad. The humor is bad. Maybe I'm just not as forgiving as some but to me this was a waste of my time and I relied heavily on the FF button (so to speak) in the last 30 mnutes.Besides being just bad, the plot just seems to wander. Too many scenes weren't needed. Too many barely needed uninteresting side plots. Plus, it felt like the casting call was "all actors who can't get a job acting". It really felt like the people that made this had no real experience at whatever their role was in aking it. There was no immersion. You felt like you were watching people pretend to be who they were. I know acting IS pretending but you're not supposed to be able to tell.Look some of this is to hit the length for a review. But in a nutshell the higher score are generous at best and the low scores are on the money. I probably would have given this a 2 but I actually felt sorry for the people in this movie."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10364272/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," Comedic Amatuer Aliens Among Us ","Nice try but...Probably one of the silliest sci fi/fantasy movies I've ever watched. Amateurish, idealistic, as I'm watching it, it's really a comedy/love story. It's an Indie film and the acting is childish, like a couple of college kids put it together. It's supposed to be something about somebody seeing a UFO and then some dorky scientist young guy who's doing who knows what who can't figure out his equation and he meets a strange girl who's probably an alien but she looks a lot like Mandy from Last Man Standing and his kooky father who's not quite all with it, grief stricken amd a mess.Terrible acting yet it's fascinating to see what these youngsters did with it. If you can stick through the acting you might like it but it's kind of silly. It might have been better if they had a good director and real actors but the story itself is far fetched or maybe not. Who knows for sure.The only good moment is when the alien mother said "this world just isn't ready". The two pretty women in it are aliens, by the way they're beautiful aliens; beautiful women.Different locations exits in every object??? Very comedic movie about aliens among us., Yet who knows?"

I love watching indies to discover new, up-and-coming talent, in front of, and behind the camera. This film accomplished a lot with a micro budget, which I enjoy seeing. The lead actress, Gracie Lacey, is enormously appealing and I thought her work was very good. Her counterpart, Michael Carico also does an admirable job, but some of the script didn't do his character any favors in the romance writing department. The writing is mostly good (not to mention intelligent), but there were instances where his character's reactions to Lacey's character were out of the blue, and (in my view), Lacey's alien character would/should have ended the relationship on the spot. Maybe her alien character likes great hair, because Carico DEFINITELY has a luxurious mane! Overall though, a nice night at the movies!"

The Freud joke about the rocket was funny too and shows the writers are educated and witty people.I think most anyone could enjoy this movie, whether they are sci fi fans or not.I'm not sure why so many 1 rating reviews.

It is charming, heartfelt and has just the right amount of otherworldliness. Speaking of which, Gracie Lacey, the lead female, is a great find. The chemistry between her Michael Carico produces some nice onscreen sparks and Paul Hayes as Ray Watts steals his scenes. I enjoyed the film's high-key aesthetic and even though the spacecraft effects look more on the affordable end, they were well-designed and executed and blended nicely with the movie which is a testament to the filmmakers' skill."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10366460/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," dream a little dream ","Greetings again from the darkness. Ruby Rossi is a high school student. She is also a CODA - Child of Deaf Adults. Her older brother is deaf too, meaning Ruby's life has been spent as an interpreter for her family, while also working on the family fishing boat in Gloucester, Massachusetts, where they are treated as outcasts and viewed as oddities by others. Ruby also loves to sing and listen to music, activities she can't share with her family. This is no coming-of-age tale, as Ruby has long been wise beyond her years. It is, however, a story of a young person finding their true self and breaking from the ties that bind to the only life she's known.Emilia Jones (HIGH-RISE, 2015) stars as Ruby, and we first see her slinging fish on the boat with her father Frank (Troy Kutsor) and brother Leo (newcomer Daniel Durant). Ruby belts out songs while the two men handle their duties, unaware of the lovely melodies filling the air. At home, the dinner table conversation is handled through ASL (American Sign Language) with mom/wife Jackie (Oscar winner Marlee Matlin, CHILDREN OF A LESSER GOD, 1986) leading the way.At school, Ruby is an outcast due to her clothes, the lingering aroma of fish, and her "weird" family. With a silent crush on Miles (Ferdio Walsh-Peelo from the excellent SING STREET, 2016), Ruby signs up for choir, but freezes during the audition. The choir director, Bernardo (roll the r's) Villalobos, is played energetically and colorfully by Eugenio Derbez (OVERBOARD, 2018), and he offers encouragement to Ruby - mostly because she has a beautiful singing voice. Bernardo explains how her singing voice offers a path to college, something she's never before considered due to family responsibilities.There is a lot going on in this film from writer-director Sian Heder (TALLULAH, 2016). It's obviously adapted from the 2014 French film LA FAMILLE BELIER, and plays as a mainstream crowd-pleaser, when it just as easily could have been a deep cut indie film. Ms. Heder's approach means a larger viewing audience, though there are elements we wish had been further explored. The teen romance never really clicks, and there are hints that Bernardo's story holds more levels than we get. However, the Rossi family dynamics are quite something to behold. Father Frank wears his emotions on his sleeve. Sometimes those emotions are angry and bitter, while other times quite comical or even horny (for his wife). Brother Leo wants desperately to lead the family business towards prosperity. He has ideas for growth, but is frustrated being dependent on Ruby as a conduit to the community.Mother Jackie and Ruby have a typical mother-teenage daughter relationship. The mother wants status quo where the daughter remains an integral part of the family, while the daughter wants her mom to acknowledge the dreams for a different life - one that capitalizes on her talents. When Jackie questions her daughter on her singing, she does so in the most hurtful way possible (brilliant writing). And yet, when mom recounts Ruby's birth, the love is as clear as the disconnect ... and likely to draw a tear or two. Filmmaker Hader serves up numerous strong scenes, but two really stood out for this viewer. First, when Ruby is singing on stage, we "hear" what the parents hear, and their pride is obvious. The second occurs when dad asks Ruby to sing for him as they are perched on the backend of the car. It's phenomenal acting by Kutsor, and further clarifies a lifelong father-daughter bond ... and the first time he fully comprehends her talent. All four leads give strong performances, and it's a star-making performance from Ms. Jones (think a young Saoirse Ronan).Apple paid a record-breaking $25 million for the film's rights at Sundance, and the mainstream appeal of this family drama sprinkled with comedy and life messages is indisputable. So while my preference would have been more focus on the 'outsider' aspect of the Rossi family in the community, it's easy to see why this choice was made. It's an entertaining film that will likely land on many year-end "Best" lists. Maybe even mine.Streaming on AppleTV+ on August 13, 2021."

Just by reading the ingredients you can already see where this movie is going. So no real surprises in Coda, you will exactly know the outcome way long before the ending. That said it's still an enjoyable movie to watch. A little bit emotional sometimes, which is almost normal as you feel compassion for the deaf people and certainly for the daughter that has a lot on her plate. Maybe a bit too much singing in my opinion but that's just because I'm not a big fan of singing in movies unless it's the music that I like but that's not likely to happen given my taste of music. Coda is predictable but it doesn't really matter as the acting is really good and that from the whole cast. Certainly worth a watch."

It is a simple, heartfelt & crowd-pleasing delight that's further bolstered by its welcome inclusivity & emotional purity.Written & directed by Sian Heder, the premise is nothing new and the route it takes is also a familiar one but the emotional beats do strike the right chord with the heart and makes it an endearing, arresting & heartwarming roller-coaster. Its portrait of deaf community in typical, day-to-day settings is carried out with care & understanding and the family dynamic is both relatable & thoroughly captivating.The small-town setting, radiant camerawork, intelligent wit, breezy pace & silent interplays add more exuberance to the experience but it's the performances from its entire cast & the spot-on chemistry they share with one another that strengthens the picture from inside out. Emilia Jones is impressive as our protagonist struggling to juggle her family's interests with her own and she is brilliantly supported by the rest.Overall, CODA (Child of Deaf Adults) takes an existing coming-of-age template, doesn't try to subvert any of the genre tropes, and even features an ending that's predictable from afar. Yet it is brought to cinematic life with so much heart, warmth & affection that the film's honesty & humanity not only stands out but shines through. Add to that, it serves as a powerful reminder of why representation matters and the difference it can make when done correctly."

I found "CODA" (CODA means Child Of Deaf Adults) beautiful and I enjoyed it very much because it had a nice, interesting plot addressing many important and unsolved subjects that society has to deal with as soon as possible. The direction which was made by Sian Heder presented very well these subjects in a very clever way combinig comedy with drama, and also made them understood very clear from the audience. The interpretation of Emilia Jones who played as Ruby Rossi was simply outstanding. Other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Troy Kotsur's who played as Frank Rossi, Daniel Durant's who played as Leo Rossi and Amy Forsyth's who played as Gertie.

Ruby is a HS senior and on a whim, she decides to sign up for the choir class simply because she loves singing. At the very first choir orientation session, the choir master asks everyone in the class to come forward and sing "Happy Birthday To You" so that he can classify the voice (alt/soprano, etc.) When it's Ruby's turn, she panics and runs out of the class room... At this point we are 10 min. Into the film,. But to tell you more of the plot should spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the US remake of a 2014 film from France called "La Famille Belier", which was a hit both critically and at the box office. I've not seen it, and so I judge "CODA" as a standalone. Strictly going by what I saw on the movie screen, I have nothing but great things to say about it. "CODA" is directed by Sian Heder, best known for having written seasons 1-3 of "Orange Is the New Black". Here she brings some sharp observations on what it's like being deaf in today's world, and obviously it ain't easy. The film also explores the economic struggles for a community like Gloucester, and in particular its (mostly mom-and-pop) fishing industry. Last but not least the film smartly balances on the one hand the strong family ties in the Rossi family, and on the other hand Ruby's desire to branch out into the world. Of course none of this would matter if the acting lacks, but instead the acting is tops, period. Marlee Latin and 2 other deaf actors play Ruby's parents and brother. And then there is the role of Rubi, played by up-and-coming British actress Emilia Jones. She is nothing short of brilliant, and surely we haven't seen the last of her, on the contrary."CODA" premiered at this year's Sundance film festival to immediate acclaim, and Apple+ immediately snapped it up for a Sundance record #25 million. The movie was released on Apple+ and also in select theaters a few weeks ago, and I finally had a chance to see it at my local arthouse theater here in Cincinnati. The Tuesday early evening where I saw this at was not attended well (exactly 5 people, including myself). Regardless, if you are in the mood for a wonderful and moving family comedy-drama, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater (while you still can), on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion."

Eugenio Derbez plays her colorful music teacher (we first see him in an ascot) who encourages her talent. Derbez performance shows warmth and wit, and is able to escape caricature. Less successful is the humor which is often forced and too overly broadly played. Sure, it's, I suppose, comforting to know that deaf families can be just as wacky as any other brood, but, tonally, it doesn't quite blend with the pathos.Jones gives a sweetly determined performance that carries the movie over it's bumps and occasionally too conventional plotting. It's a strong performance that lifts not only the movie, but the other performances as well. Jones stands out, but, it's never showy. A young actress to keep an eye on.CODA, the winner of Sundance's top award (which lead to Apple paying $25M for its rights), occasionally falls into the trap of seeming to check off the usual Festival Award Winner attributes (why do all young persons seem to be involved in Music and the Arts?), but, fortunately, Jones and and the movie's uplift make it a worthwhile journey."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10366460/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," Best film I have seen this summer! (2021) ","This film has it all. It is hilariously funny. I hadn't laugh this much all summer long and this film really help my brain release the endorphins. My ribs hurt from laughing. The film has a tremendous amount of heart. This was a tear jerker by the end. All of the characters are so lovable and reliable. Watching Frank Rossi describe how to put a condom on in sign language to Miles was just ...agghhh amazing.Director Sian Heder knocked it out of the park with extremely laser precision on-point direction. Specially how he had the actors who played Ruby's parents react to the singing at the high school. Everything was so on point and believable. Emilia Jones was outstanding. Such a beautiful and talented redhead. Can you imagine how hard is to find an excellent actress that is also an amazing singer? Seriously, I am super impressed with the whole cast. If this is television, then Heder raised the bar very high. Not only was the direction fantastic, but so was the screenplay. It was witty, funny and intelligent. This should have been a theatrical film. Honestly, I'll keep it short because if I could, I could name about a dozen scenes in this film that I loved. It was one after another, freaking fantastic scenes.The only con I can think of was the title. Why an acronym for such a beautiful film?SOLID 10/10 and screw the haters. This film really deserved the 10."

An emotional powerhouse."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10366460/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," Trials and tribulations ","An emotional and inspiring movie, which will touch the heart of many viewers who watch this incredibly well made film. It did so for me, although my background and experiences are completely different. It makes one think of your own youth, the trials and tribulations and guts needed to make the break to create your own path towards the future."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10366460/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Charming and sincere! ","Ever since premiering at Sundance film festival to rave reviews, I've been looking forward to CODA but have always kept my expectations in check. CODA is a coming-of-age story sees Ruby (played by Emilia Jones in one of the best performances this year), a girl with a penchant for singing, grappling with chasing her dreams while helping her deaf family which she happens to be the only hearing member in. The story is nothing special, and the film itself is anything but groundbreaking. Rather, it's one that thrives off of its simplicity from which it yields enriching subtlety.For starters, the family dynamic is priceless. Whether they're squabbling or having a laugh, their interactions with each other are like quickfire repartees that have you transfixed while at play, and are sunk in as soon as they end. The humour in this movie originally generates either from how crude and blunt Ruby's family is (more on that later) or from the complexity of non-verbal communication. Yet, the movie never looks down at deaf people or even regards them patronizingly, and each time we spend some moments with the family makes this more and more evident. Does the same go for the family itself and each member of it? And are they perfectly imperfect as they seem? Not really.As the family has its own identity, each character has its own individual personality and unique mannerisms, too. And it's here where we get to see through the cracks in each one of them. Ruby is the one who communicates with them and the sign-language interpreter and mediator between them and the townspeople. Ironically, none of her family members is able to properly communicate their feelings to Ruby herself, the thing that made her dilemma more and more perplexing and befuddling.Ruby's brother, Leo (Daniel Durant), grows tired of people regarding him and his parents as 'disabled'. He feels that he's seen as helpless and "freak" - as one once called him before getting into a bar brawl. That feeling is further amplified when he realises how much they rely on his sister to be their connection to the outside world. As a consequence, he puts the blame on Ruby because he feels that he lives under her sister's shadow, let alone she's his younger sibling. In his heart, however, he loves his sister dearly. And after knowing of her talent, he becomes worried her potential might go to waste as a result of staying with them forever instead of pursuing her passion.As for the mother, Jackie (Marlee Matlin), things are much more complicated. She bans Ruby from listening to music while they're at the table because that's 'rude' since it's not something "(they) all can do together," and she's frustrated at learning she joined the school choir. Later on, she's desperate to do anything to stop her from heading off to the music school because that way they'd lose their only 'interpreter' they can't afford to keep their fishing business afloat. Thus, her actions and intentions seem to be solely based on the family's business' interests with a total disregard to Ruby's. She comes across as exploitative, and also as someone who clearly sees deafness as a deficiency that the whole family must suffer from. That said, it's revealed that all that has something to do with her past, which I'm not going to spoil but it shows how much Jackie's actually concerned about her relationship with her daughter.However, it's not only about her family, as Ruby herself has her own internal conflict and restrictions that she's built for herself - unwillingly, of course. On the face of it, she's ashamed of her family because of how shamelessly frank they are, especially her father (Troy Kotsur), who legitimately got Ruby in some awkwardly embarrassing situations. On closer inspection, though, we see she's learned to adopt a new persona at school over the years because 'sounding like a deaf person' made her classmates make fun of her. Unfortunately, she learned to be normal by being different, only to become diffident. The whole thing about her inspiring, eccentric music teacher (Eugenio Derbez) telling her that her problem is that she's "holding her voice," as though she's suppressing it, is a metaphor for her true self and identity she's been nearly stripped of unconsciously, whether because she's confined to her familial obligation or to avoid feelings of inadequacy and mortification."The stars here, they don't look as good as they do on the water." The second half of CODA is undeniably the weakest. As I mentioned earlier, the story itself is pretty formulaic, with its ups and downs, romantic storyline that slipped into clich territory before even we're halfway through, and 'too-good-to-be-true' moments by the end. Nevertheless, CODA overflows with emotional beats that are bound to melt even the stony hearts, which the second half, in particular, is replete with. I mean, I almost teared up in three scenes! If that doesn't eclipse its shortcomings I don't know what does. It's not a film about hearing or deafness per se, but rather about the expression of inner feelings suppressed by circumstances, and by doing so it sets itself apart from your conventional inspirational films about finding your voice and following your dreams, despite conforming to their exact same formula. Sweet, tender and earnest, CODA is a crowd-pleaser and one of the biggest surprises of the year."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10366460/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," Sweet and beautiful ","Oh yeah being deaf doesn't mean that you can't be horny.An Apple+ Original about a high school student who was the only hearing person in her family.I already love the movie when it started out. There were many funny and clever jokes mostly from the main character's deaf parents that showed the tight relationship in the family. I was consistently entertained with what our main character had to go through because she was the only hearing person in her family.This led to the main conflict for our main character. The struggle between family responsibilities and one's hope and dream was a familiar theme that is explored many times before. However, the story created a new and unique situation that had me sympathized with not our main character, but also her family members. The family dynamics worked so well that the situation even more conflicting.Still, the movie had many sweet moments. The audition scene near the end was beautiful and got me emotional there. Also, Emilia Jones, who played the main girl Ruby, had a beautiful voice, and I loved every scene where she sang.As for problems, the progression was definitely a bit formulaic, but it didn't bother me much at all.Overall, a sweet, beautiful, and unique slice of life/coming of age story. 9/10."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10366460/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," A Small film that hits all the right notes ","My Review - CODA My Rating 9/10 The movie title CODA is an acronym for Child Of Deaf Adults which is the premise for this wonderful "Indie film "Independent films are produced by smaller production companies. They do not follow the same formula. As studio films.Instead, they vary in style and genre and usually have a production budget which is a fraction of the studio films in my opinion they often have more to say than many big budget Studio movies .Just imagine living in a family of four and being the only member of that family that can hear. Even in the most loving and supportive family like the Rossi family in "CODA " imagine the challenges faced as the daughter who can hear having to put your life aspirations and dreams on hold to take on the role of interpreter for your Mother, Father and Brother because they have no hearing at all.When the family's fishing business is threatened, Ruby finds herself torn between pursuing her love of music and her fear of abandoning her parents.The movie is beautifully set in the seaside locations of Gloucester, Rockport and Boston in Massachusetts CODA, premiered at Sundance Film Festival in 2021, winning more awards than any film in Sundance history. It captivated audiences and prompted a bidding war between Netflix, Amazon, Searchlight and Apple which concluded in Apple paying a record breaking $25 million for world wide rights to the movie.CODA, written and directed by Sian Heder, is an English-language remake of the French-language film La Famille Blier, which was released in 2014 and was successful at the French box office.Philippe Rousselet was one of the original film's producers, and he had the rights to do a remake. He and producer Patrick Wachsberger approached Sian Heder to direct a remake for a United States audience. Sian Heder said, "They were interested in adapting the film, but they wanted someone to make it unique and take the premise from the original and, also, reinvent it." Well I haven't seen the La Famille Blier yet but Sian Heder (take note Academy) has more than succeeded. Sian is another brilliant female Writer, Producer, Director who previous to CODA wrote and produced a critically acclaimed short film in 2006 "Mother" and help write and produce 20 episodes of the hit series "Orange is the New Black." There have been 2 brilliant movies this year concerning the life experiences of characters who are profoundly hearing impaired or totally deaf .One was the superb film "Sound of Metal" about a heavy-metal drummer's life that is thrown into freefall when he begins to lose his hearing.CODA is a very different story I gave "Sound of Metal" and CODA both a 9/10 Rating because both films have characters that are real, vulnerable and totally convincing . Their life experiences interested me and opened up a world of complex difficulties that I can only imagine because I can hear and take it for granted so authentic movies about people with a disability like deafness or blindness I find fascinating and educational.Both Directors of these films use a clever and dramatic technique for a few minutes that allows the movie audience to do just that.In "Sound of Metal" when the drummer Rubin Stone is walking a street for the first time with his Cochlear implants we hear what he hears just distorted loud sounds that are more disturbing than no sound at all.In CODA when Ruby's family attend their daughter Ruby's Concert in which she is performing a duet they can only watch the reactions of the audience to something they cant experience themselves .The soundtrack is silent in part of the song to show their reactions to the movie its one of the many moving scenes in this film . Another for me was when Ruby's Dad Frank asks her to sing for him only and gently touches his daughters threat to feel the vibrations of her beautiful voice.Emilia Jones the talented 19 year old daughter of famous Welsh singer Aled Jones does have a beautiful voice and it's a joy to hear her version of the Joni Mitchell classic song " Both Sides Now " Emilia Jones impressed me greatly in her role as Ruby Rossi when she filmed CODA she was only 17 or 18 years old .I predict she will become a major Cinema Star in the future she has already been nominated for a BAFTA British Academy Award for her role in the series "Locke & Key." which was filmed for Netflix after CODA it also looks very impressive .For her role in CODA, Emilia had to spend nine months learning American Sign Language, have singing lessons and learn how to operate a professional fishing trawler.All the characters in this movie interested me 1987 Oscar Winner Marlee Matlin is perfect as Jackie Rossi the strong willed but loving matriarch of the family .Marlee Matlin was born deaf as was Troy Kotsur who plays Ruby's craggy weather beaten seafaring but very sensitive and loving Father Frank Rossi.Daniel Durant cast as Ruby's brother was born to deaf parents and went to the Minnesota State Academy for the Deaf in Faribault, Minnesota, where he got involved with theater. He's great as the eldest son who feels he's living in the shadow of his talented sister because of his family's dependence on her hearing.Another delightful performance from John Fiore as Tony Salgado the High School music teacher who sees great promise in Ruby and encourages her to think of a life outside her family .There are so many highlights in CODA it's an uplifting film as one reviewer noted "CODA" is a small movie that hits all the right notes it's a beautiful film."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10366460/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," Sundance 2021: CODA might very well end up as my favorite film of the festival and one of the best movies of the year! ","If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)I know Sundance is one of those festivals that carry dozens of impressive, impactful films from writer-directors that really throw themselves into the art of filmmaking and storytelling. I anticipated being blown away by many movies that I knew nothing about or didn't recognize the crew and cast involved. I expected some films to emotionally impact me so much that I'd save them close to my heart until the very end of the year. With this said, I was unbelievably far from imagining that the very first viewing would be a heavy contender for my absolute favorite movie of the entire festival.CODA (Child Of Deaf Adults) is the first film I watch by Sin Heder, and after this session, I can't wait to see what she did so far and what she's going to do in the future. The clearly interesting premise is developed through a much more emotional narrative than I expected. From rich visual storytelling to exceptional use of sign language, Heder is able to capture something unique and deeply important to transmit to the audience and to today's society. The world was fortunate enough to get Sound of Metal last year, and CODA reinforces the essential message that being deaf must not be seen as a massive disability or a brutal handicap.As the movie cleverly communicates through its impeccable screenplay, having some sort of "limitation" doesn't automatically characterize someone as weird, different, or that the respective family members don't love each other as much or more than the so-called "normal" families. Except for a somewhat insignificant love relationship featuring the main character (that could have brought up an entirely different, unnecessary, and even distracting topic to the film's central, vital themes), I was incredibly invested in every single storyline.In fact, I find every interaction within the deaf family much more compelling and captivating than any other dialogue in the movie, and this is mostly due to the amazing performances from the cast. Leaving the protagonist to the end, Daniel Durant (Leo Rossi, brother) and Marlee Matlin (Jackie Rossi, mother) are great as supporting characters, but Troy Kotsur (Frank Rossi, father) and Eugenio Derbez (Bernardo Villalobos, music teacher) literally left me in tears with their heartfelt displays. I could feel the outstanding commitment to their roles, and I'm delighted that Bernardo Villalobos isn't just another stereotypical, cliche, hysterical choir adult.However, the biggest praise in my bag must go to powerful glue that holds everything together, elevating the whole film to a whole other level: Emilia Jones as the only hearing member of the family, Ruby Rossi. First of all, I love music, and Pentatonix is actually my favorite group (acapella or not), so hearing so many wonderful voices singing together would always be a massive plus for CODA in my review. Nevertheless, not only Jones' voice is sumptuously heartwarming, but her performance has everything an actor needs to receive acting nominations. I can't remember the last time I was fully invested in a single character in such an emotionally powerful manner, and Jones is definitely a major reason.A final praise to Paula Huidobro's visually grabbing camera work and Marius de Vries, who composed the movie's subtle yet efficient score and who I'm guessing had a hand in the song choices. Either way, terrific job.CODA may very well end up as my favorite film of the 2021's edition of the Sundance Film Festival, and it will undoubtedly become a must-watch movie when it's available worldwide. Sin Heder offers her impeccable direction and beautifully written screenplay, which is packed with emotionally powerful moments that left me tearing up for the last forty-five minutes. Boasting an educative, meaningful message regarding the deaf community and what our society perceives as a tremendous handicap/disability, the characteristic visual storytelling and the captivating interactions within the deaf family prove to be incredibly investing, deeply elevating the overall piece. With the help of heartfelt, genuine performances from the supporting cast (mainly Troy Kotsur and Eugenio Derbez), Emilia Jones takes off and lands one of my favorite female performances in a long, long time. A tear-inducing, thoughtful film that I hope will conquer audiences all around the world.Rating: A"

",""CODA" is an endearing and moving story about the reality of deaf parents and their hearing children, told from the perspective of the teenage daughter.

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10366514/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," Film is more about the engineers love life than really the construction and design of the Eiffel Tower. ","Eiffel is a new romantic biography directed and partly written by Martin Bourboulon, the director of the Papa ou maman film series.The film is about the engineer Gustave Eiffel (Romain Duris). After helping to design world-famous buildings such as the Statue of Liberty, Eiffel is asked by the French government to help design a new tower. Eifel rejects the government, because he is already busy enough with other projects. When Eiffel sees his old love Adrienne Bourgs (Emma Mackey) during a dinner, his old feelings for her rekindle. To give her these feelings again, he tries to impress her and agrees to build the tower. So this becomes his new passion project.The project of this biography of how the Eiffel Tower was conceived and built was already around 1997, but never really came up with a good idea or story to make into a film. Several film studios and directors have looked at the project, but have not come up with a film. In the end, the starting producer Vanessa van Zuylen managed to make the film together with director Martin Bourboulon. Together with screenwriter Caroline Bongrand, they continued with the project that led to the final film.Unfortunately, all the people behind the idea and making of the final film are on the novice side in the film world, which unfortunately shows in the film. They chose to focus the film more on the relationship between Gustave and Adrienne than on the actual design or construction of the Eiffel Tower. The film quickly becomes a clich romantic film about two old lovers, who struggle to pick up their old relationship again. For people who like romantic movies, the movie can be entertaining, but otherwise just come across as a standard romantic drama. People who would rather have seen the story of the design or construction of the Eiffel Tower should check Wikipedia or an informative YouTube video. The scenes of the building process of the Eiffel Tower are interesting to watch, but for this you have to get through a somewhat trite romantic film.Romain Duris and Emma Mackey deliver good acting, but don't do anything special with the film either. In flashbacks, the viewer learns how the two met and how their relationship went."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10366514/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," A mixed bag ","The acting was good, as were the photography and the sets which suitably evoked the Paris of the 1880s and the tower construction.I felt it a shortcoming that the film seemed to reduce the massive engineering design work to little more than Eiffel drawing sketches of his planned tower. In those pre-computer times, there would have had to be teams of people doing calculations (probably with slide rules), but while this aspect did not need to be laboured, it would have been good to at least give it some acknowledgement by having Eiffel walk through the office.As already noted in the comments, the background love story sometimes intrudes on the film narrative. There also seems a jump in the tower construction to finalisation, despite questions having been raised about the ongoing support of the council and funding.Overall, an enjoyable film, even if not in the 'great' category."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10366514/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," A triumph ","I was lucky enough to see this film in Sydney for the French Film Festival. It captures not only a wonderful engineering feat, but also the thrilling life and times of the Eiffel Tower's creator. A man who was unrelenting in his desire to create a legacy, regardless of the pressure on him.I can only hope that this film gets a cinematic release that it deserves in Europe and elsewhere."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10366514/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Shame about the ending. ","Beautifully produced film with great story, great filming, great actors, but spoilt by very poor ending. Eiffel, the architect of the amazing tower, is beset by huge financial problems, huge construction problems, huge political problems, yet suddenly we cut to the completed tower, with crowds cheering and champagne flowing, and no explanation as to how any of these issues were resolved!

Even a huge tractor couldn't have done that fast enough! I really disliked the cinematography, because it had a harsh, videotape feel, and that's how almost all the movies are now, unless they are big-budget films. I liked the story for the most part, even if it was like so many others, but honestly, even Lifetime movies are a step up from this one. I thought the character of "David" was portrayed competently enough, but "Lisa" made me feel like I was watching a high school play, and she was the understudy. These two had zero chemistry with each other or with me as a viewer, and I quickly ceased to care about them. I really wanted to turn this movie off, but I waited to see it through to the end, since I'd waded through it that far. I wish I would have trusted my gut and just turned it off."

I was thinking it would be a 5 but it ended up being a 3. The acting was passable, with some actors doing better than others. The setting was small town woodsy, and it was obvious that they didn't spend a whole lot. Editing could have been a lot tighter. The story had me believing it was actually going to go somewhere, but it actually went nowhere. Not only did it go nowhere, it took forever not to get there. It's not just the story, it's the two leads. They had no chemistry and I didn't believe they'd had a past. Some things you do find out, but just because you know does not mean that there is any resolution. And that my friends is a nice way of saying the ending was terrible. I do not recommend this film."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10370042/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," This Film Is Quite An Achievement For Australian Cinema! ","A young woman named Aria Wolf (Charlotte Best) wakes up in an elevator, finding she is tied up and blindfolded. She soon breaks free from her bindings and discovers that she is alone in a high-speed elevator in Shanghai with no memory of her past. Aria also has no clue who her captors are, nor why they would kidnap her and hold her in a building 120 floors high. Attempting to break out of the elevator, she uses the inbuilt phone system and escape hatch but has no luck. She also discovers her phone hidden in her back pocket with minimal battery life. Soon Aria has the chance to talk with her captors, try to work out what they want and, more importantly, try to escape the elevator and gain freedom. Along the way, she will also learn more about her hidden past and the incredible power inside her. Ascendant was created by first time director Antaine Furlong, who also serves as a writer and exclusive producer.The film's opening is grand. The audience and Aria share in the mystery together, with little information given about her current situation. It is undoubtedly an excellent mystery, to begin with, and more secrets are introduced as the film progresses. As Aria tries to reason and talk with her captors, we are shown moments from her past when she was a young child.Visually Ascendant is perfect. The visuals are incredibly stunning right from the film's opening. Any moments that contain CGI were also striking to witness on the big screen. The film's sound effects were another pleasing element. Even more likeable was the film's soundtrack, composed by David Hirschfelder, who is well known for his work in many other Australian films such as Shine, Elizabeth, and Australia. Performances throughout the film are ok with some side performances equivalent to what one might see in a video game.As a plot, while I enjoyed the film's opening, general premise, and some of the introduced mysteries, I cannot deny that the film is slightly complex and confusing, contrasting with other moments that feel vague. While backstories to Aria's past are welcoming to see, I found these moments lacked core details that would have assisted the film's plot. Major twists that Aria encounters throughout the movie while being trapped in the elevator were also entirely predictable.Overall, as a directional debut by Antaine Furlong, this film is quite an achievement for Australian Cinema. The film is visually stunning to watch from start to finish with excellent CGI work and an impressive soundtrack by composer David Hirschfelder. Performances are generally acceptable, and the film's plot, for the most part, is also pleasing, but it certainly lacks detail and clarity. As a directional debut, it's a step in the right direction, and I look forward to what's to come from Antaine Furlong. Based on this film's quality and production, it is best to view it on a giant screen with an impressive sound system.5.1/10 - Walkden Entertainment."

If they gave a bit more explanation instead of making you have to guess and you don't really know what the storyteller is the thought is because it could have been many different ways and then trying to make it one of those feel good movies and let's not have any action in it you kind of ruin the movie where I think once she unlocked her I think it was her sister they were kind of locked into the same person have the sister rescue the dad by now she has these magical powers going and take the guys out with the guns and you don't have to make the movie full of action that could last all 5 minutes maybe 10 minutes of the movie but I think instead the writers and the director wanted to make this until one of those oh you know let's try and make it into a completely fdeelgoodmovie that has no action or. My opinion if you put a little bit of action in it and showed a little bit of her using her powers you probably would have done much better in the box office because then you can hit that demographic of them you know the male 18 to 49 or whatever but you're not really going to hit that demographic you know you'll have some people watch it but you're not going to have a lot of people in that 18 to 49 demographic."

Plot bizarre, turgid and barely understandable, pace slow, action barely evident.Premise that the environment is our saviour laudable but cliched.Not worth watching, as boring as Divergent.I was the only one in the cinema and I'm not surprised. I started tapping out tunes on the arms of my chair to entertain myself."

I've been waiting to see this movie forever because I have been wanting to see something new with Charlotte Best. But 1, I couldn't stay focused through this movie to get an actual account for the plot, which left me totally confused as to what I just watch by the end. Ok, she's "something special." But WTF IS SHE?!? A future Avenger? Soon-to-be member of the Legion of Doom?!"

","I truly feel sorry for the actress staring in this... she did a very good job, unfortunately the entire storyline, editing, and directing were poor, to say the least. I have no problem with a slow moving plot driven film... I prefer them to the unrealistic/asinine Hollywood movies being pumped out. There simply wasn't enough to the storyline they ended up going with. Well acted and visually pretty in parts, but it's just missing something."

Its clearly attracted some of the wrong audience, who've jumped onto IMDB to vent their outrage but some of them have said the same thing about the Dry.If you like contained thrillers this one, is a must see."

Some below certainly had high expectations by the looks of it comparing it to the big budget Divergence series. To anyone reading this it's Australias first female driven sci-fi thriller. Its not a big budget move. Just about everyone who didn't like it was male, one actually said go see Nobody. This is what internet has done.The story is complicated but I think deliberately done so, its constantly setting you up, the direction is extremely smart and after looking at professional reviews they all seem to praise him. I can see why to make a thriller like this with limited locations must have been a struggle, the story is limited, but interesting.I can see why it's snapped up for the US market. I just hope they get the marketing right, so not to attract the 'Nobody' customers."

I was expecting garbage but was pleasantly surprised.I don't recall any Australian film like it, a country that produces drama, and nothing else to offer, this while not perfect, was a shock, more of this Australia.First time Director certainly did his job, what an accomplishment. Great effort for trying.All these troll reviews seem to compare it to Interstellar or Divergence - LOL if only they had the money."

This film has received some great reviews from AU review, Cinema Australia etc. This was a mammoth undertaking by a rookie filmmaker. This is not a film the older generation of Aussies will like, generation David Stratton who I've mentioned in other critiques, is anti American. I see someone mentions him below, don't listen to it. While this is Australian made, the characters are American in it, who've lived in Australia and New York. I agree with the AU review and tend to agree with Peter most of the time. This film deserves respect. It's a very complex story that gives nuggets of information, so you really need to pay attention. Performances are great from Charlotte Best , Jonny Pas and Alex Menglet (who would be relatively unknown.)My local theatres is old but the sound still did its job made you pay attention. There's a lot of heart and sacrifice in this story with a lovely ending. No spoilers.Not sure I will see elevators there same way again. Definitely worth a watch."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10370042/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," Surprised ","Got to watch a screener, never heard of it. Australian made scifi and was pleasantly surprised by it.Aside that I hate elevators, and no even hate them more, this was original. Flat in the middle, but picks up afterwards, surprising end to it.Well done Australia."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10370042/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","1"," Terrible ","I'm sure there is a good story to be told with this movie but the director failed to convey it to the audience. It's like when your friend tries to tell you something awesome that happened to them when they were drunk but they only retell parts of it to you, as their emotional experience fills in the gaps of knowledge in their own mind, but to you what they are saying makes no sense.This may have worked as a prequel to an established storyline but not as an initial film with anticipated sequels to fill in the gaps, if that's the way the director planned it to be.I like Charlotte Best, she did a good job of a terrible film, hope it doesn't hurt her acting career."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10370042/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," Excellent Psychological Thriller ","I am puzzled by some of the negative, unjust and unfair user reviews Ascendant has received. The acting, direction, soundtrack and special effects were all excellent. It was abstract and surreal in parts which required the audience's attentiveness. The storyline might be difficult to follow and confusing for some people but I found the movie totally engrossing. Give Ascendant a chance you won't be dissappointed. Please note: this movie is not for immature moviegoers."

I don't believe for a second anyone walked out of a cinema like the comment below. I saw people jump due to the high level attention. The music and sound was incredible. Very angry people below. Not sure anything makes them happy. Definitely worth a watch, it's getting great reviews here in Australia."

I would mention the plot, but I have no idea what it was. I guess the acting is okay but again how do you really know when there is just mountain sized plot holes in the script.

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10370710/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," Genuine ","The 2021 Norwegian dark romantic comedy/melodrama "The Worst Person in the World" (Verdens Verste Menneske) directed by Joachim Trier premiered at the Cannes Film Festival. It is a deeply moving, yet hilarious film about the triumphs of existentialism, love as a whole and the ups and downs of everyday life. It captures the beauty but also the pitfalls of life. The film is a deep character study of a 30-year-old woman Julie trying to tackle work, relationships, family life and uncovering existential questions, such as, what is love or what is the meaning of life. It is split in 12 chapters, a prologue, and an epilogue. The opening montage where Julie experiences flashbacks and reminisces about her time as a medical student, getting different gigs as a photographer and working part-time as a bookkeeper was a nice touch by the director.At times the film can surprise the spectator out of nowhere. The whole sequence where Julie is tripping on magic mushrooms must be one of the most insane and strange yet perfectly timed and edited scenes of a dark romantic comedy.To conclude, Joachim Trier's "The Worst Person in the World" is an absolute delight and portrays Julie's complicated life with honesty and pathos. It captures the good, the bad, and the ugliness of life. The film benefits from its inventive screenplay crafted by Joachim Trier and Eskil Vogt. The characters are nuanced and fleshed out without devoting time on them. The spotlight stays on the lead character Julie for the entirety of the film. It does not have any superfluous scenes or issues with the dialogue. The film is one of the most accurate depictions of a struggling woman from the bourgeoisie class trying to find her purpose. It follows her through her highs and lows. "The Worst Person in the World" is an absolute delight and one of the best romantic comedies I have seen.*One of my favourite moments of the film is when Julie is talking to some women at a party, and they tell her that if you cuddle your children, they turn out to be drug addicts. That was comedy gold.*Another moment that was strange, disgusting yet hilarious was when Julie and Eivind smell each other's sweat and urinate consecutively in front of each other. The film is filled with these witty moments.*I never visited Oslo, but it kind of reminded me of Copenhagen. Side note: The individual shots of Oslo were beautiful.*Julie's father is hands down one of the standout characters of the film despite his limited screen time.*I kind of dozed off during the last two chapters. It felt too melancholic and slow paced even though these are primary features of the melodrama.*The sequence where Julie's surroundings are frozen in time and the consecutive reaction shots felt like the viewer is looking directly at a painting.Final verdict: 9.2/10."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10370710/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Not a masterpiece, but worth seeing ","Reading the other reviews I am amazed polarizing this film seems to be. When I watched the film a few days ago at the Viennale (Vienna International Film Festival), I would never have thought that it could breed controversy. My feelings about it lie somewhere in between those comments. I never felt it to be boring but I also never thought it groundbreaking in any way. The film, especially in the beginning, has a light approach to the story, almost as if taking its main protagonist not too serious. The narration and chapter style enhances this impression. There are many, quite entertaining, cinematic ideas and moments, most remarkable the long "freeze" sequence and some animation scenes. I found those very fitting in a positive sense since the aim of the character was to find her own way of being. The male versus female relationship question about prospects, identity, future are discussed at length. Sexism is also a theme that creeps up. The film develops a deeper meaning toward the end while the final episode was a kind of let down experience which I don't want to elaborate, otherwise I would need to mark this with spoiler alert.The acting of all is first class and touching, but why there is such an excitement on the side of the critics eludes me."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10370710/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," Pretty boring ","The hype this movie has got is way too exaggerated. It was pretty boring, slow and predictable. The main character is a selfish and confused person, not particularly nice or sympathetic. Also some of the male actors is pretty terrible. Two hours of my life I don't get back."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10370710/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Search for Virtue in Modern Society ","The Worst Person in the World is Triers last film in his Oslo trilogy (Reprise, Oslo August 31th), and it's about a women named Julie (Reinsve) whom is struggling to find her place in the world.Virtue is the quality of being a good person and doing the right things, both for yourself and for others. I believe that Trier is problematizing this in this film by asking the question about whether or not you should do whats expected from the world around you, like settling for a more or less standardized life in forms of career and familiy, or if you should be out there and experiment to find your place in a rather confusing modern society.Julie is on her way into her thirties and is in a relationship with Aksel (Danielsen). She is an indecisive individual when it comes to what to make out of her life. Aksel, being in his mid forties, is ready to have a familiy of his own, but Julie is not ready for that just yet. Her search for an meaningful existence leads her to another man named Eivind (Norddrum), which she falls in love with. She leaves Aksel in hope for that this time, things will be different, but will it be so?This film is beautiful and intelligent. The way it depitcs todays social relations and culture in Norway, and probably other places in the world, is spot-on. All characters are deep and profound, where everyone of them playes an important role in the story no matter how big their part is on the screen. Everything seems to be in its right place.The Worst Person in the World is another great film by Joachim Trier."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10370710/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Rom com with bite ","This Norwegian rom com wins on so many levels. The lead actress playing someone who is in search of meaning and a place of her own in the world to be. The two love interests fulfil their roles while being true to themselves and not cliches. Both male choices are not wrong or right they just merely are.The gaze is mostly female as in the male nudity scene and what she sees in the world. When the journalist accuses one boy friend of sexism that is the protagonists view but she also recognises how unfair that accusation can be in terms of comic books.The tone scintillates, is bubbly, but always real. The passive aggressive father who refuses to have anything to do with his daughter. He demurs at every count, even at the cost of parking for a couple of hours to see his daughter. Not a monster in his own mind but one the protagonist has to cut off.The first two thirds of the film is fresh and determinedly tackles the protagonist and her two lover's with a deft touch that is kind to all. None have a standard career, but all want to do their part in the world.The first two thirds of the film is classic rom com but the last third becomes mired in the nitty gritty of choices and more importantly being able to look at choices, know them, and only having the option of living in the past with them. So 7/8 for the first part and 1/3 for the last which is thought provoking but veers towards cliche."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10370710/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","3"," A boring mess ","Let's start with the positives: the way it showcases the city of Oslo and the radio interview of Aksel, one of the protagonists.The rest was a boring mess; there's a voice narrator who magically disappears half way through the movie, a weird epiphany with people frozen in time, a mushroom trip that turns into comics, shaky close-ups that last en eternity all while the protagonist,with the personality of a pencil, goes around breaking hearts. No idea what the point of this movie was."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10370710/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," Your movie ","This will haunt you for the rest of your life, so much beauty and creativity. Great actors. Great script. It's like one of those films you never want to see again because you're afraid to ruin it.Why do I love it, we'll it's because Trier always manages to make movies about you. If not you-now then a past-you. You can so easily relate to the storyline and the characters. So when you leave the theaters you feel really good about yourself. It stays with you. I'm really glad that I saw this movie."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10370710/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","1"," The Worst Movie in The World ","Its almost clich for people to talk about how we've all become narcissists, because of poor parenting has corrupted our sense of self and reshaped us into self-obsessed, self-preoccupied, self-centered, egotistical and selfish beings.

","A big budget, large-scale production, good sets and locations, great camera work, splendid editing, use of colors, etc! It's a shame it doesn't fulfill your expectations as a continuation of the series.This time around, we have a wild chase throughout Tokyo trampling over a regional festival (Obon), taking part in a Cosplay parade and being involved with Japanese Mafia. Along with Detective #2 (the Japanese rich guy from the previous one), a political case needs to be solved.. it's hardly a mystery plot anymore. You can't really play along this time! It's development is easily derailed from the premise, with too many ideas to make it seem grander than it is. And there is less comedy (what there is.. is of lesser quality).I was surprised and delighted to see the respected Asano-san "chew scenery" and have so much fun with his given role (at least someone knew the movie they were in)! Tony Jaa, on the other hand... is underused for a physical roles, and his English is improving but still bad. The cast continues to increase for no good reason, and no one is memorable. Choreography is decent, but set-pieces are simply dumber this time around. I'm having a hard time remembering things with details even now.There seems to be a lot left to cover in what might be Detective Chinatown 4. I'm much less interested in it now.I don't understand how this made so much money.. and it's not worth seeing for that reason alone. The first entry is still the best one."

A forcefully constructed universe featuring star after star. It's sad to know that with this kind of budget this is what the team chooses to put together even with the extra time and money to make things right. Transition between scenes is senseless, dialogues are cringy and character motive being non-existent. I can tell Chen Sichen tries to be creative and funny, but his method perhaps only works for himself and his group of friends. The best work the entire series has done so far is sadly the TV series, and the first couple episodes of it. Detective Chinatown 1 seemed like a doorway to something interesting that deserves to be further developed, but at this point I simply hope they could just stop."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10370822/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Fun mystery ","This is the 3rd of Detective Chinatown series. Knowing it is likely physical comedy combined with a little mystery, I did not expect much. And that is what I got.The main detectives were invited to Tokyo to solve a mystery. They ran into international competitions. At one point it felt like a computer game, which was interesting. The case was alright - nothing impressive with forgivable imperfections.Overall I think it is comparable to the first two of the series."

It's a lot more of the same, which is not necessarily a bad thing. A lot of the gags in this movie land better for me than the second movie. The second movie was okay for me. This one is better in my book. The mystery is not as strong as the last two entries, but somehow i feel like the plot is better. If you're as into the franchise as I am, it's very satisfying to see everything tie together (especially the tie ins from the IQiyi TV series). You'll see Lin Mo and Noda Hiroshi's brother from the TV show. The movie is very fun and it never seems to slow down. I don't think it hits the highs of the first movie but it's still really good.

First, freshman helmer Joth Riggs' white-knuckled, nail-biter is neither a sequel to the enthralling "Sicario" (2015) co-starring Emily Blunt & Josh Brolin nor its sequel "Sicario: Day of the Soldado" (2018) with Benicio De Toro. Second, from a marketing perspective, it's easy to understand why Saban Films resorted to this obvious marketing strategy and replaced the original title "Blindsided" with "Night of the Sicario." Technically, the title describes the action. Villainous sicarios shoot up city streets and corner their prey in an assisted care facility. Basically, these cartel gunmen must liquidate a DEA informant, Teresa Fuentes (Amanda Diaz) before she can testify in court. Everything goes haywire for everybody when a Category 4 hurricane threatens Washington, D. C. The gunmen ambush Teresa's husband Francisco Fuentes (Martin Pea of "The Fanatic") and her daughter Amelia Fuentes (Addison Kendall of "Tuesday June 6th") on the way from the airport in a DEA SUV, and wound Francisco in the side. Eventually, the father and daughter take refuge in an assisted care facility that our protagonist Taylor Ward (Natasha Henstridge of "Ghosts of Mars") operates. Anyway, the setting of this sluggish thriller evokes memories of the gritty Humphrey Bogart & Lauren Bacall hostage thriller "Key Largo" (1948) about gangsters holed up in hotel during a hurricane. Apart from the noisy street shootout at the start, director Joth Biggs and freshman scribes Ernesto Melara and Matthew Eason confine the intrigue to the assisted living care facility. The Mel Gibson hurricane thriller "Force of Nature" (2020) confined its characters to a private apartment building in a hurricane, but "Night of the Sicario" contains only a fraction of its violence. Ironically, for an R-rated feature, profanity and nudity are conspicuously absent.Unfortunately, the suspense and tension are as flabby as Ms. Henstridge's figure. Indeed, this isn't the same statuesque starlet of the "Species" franchise, and she struggles to hide her surplus poundage with loose fitting apparel. In all fairness to Ms. Henstridge, since she is playing a nurse rather than an action heroine, her added weight lends her a modicum of credibility. Don't expect her to wield any conventional weapons or resort to gravity-defying kung fun acrobatics. Only during the last ten minutes does she fight her adversaries. The sicario gunmen who hold them hostage have got to be the most lenient killers on record. They put up with a lot of crap from the elderly residents. In real life, these merciless gunmen would have shot everybody and then torn the house apart to the last splinter searching for who they want. Toss in an obligatory DEA agent who winds up wanting the same thing they are after, and you've got a lame thriller. Anyway, what we are left with is a lethargic thriller that reminded me of the vintage Humphrey Bogart movie "Key Largo" about gangsters holed up in hotel during a storm. Clocking in at 82 minutes, "Night of the Sicario" is something faith-based audiences will enjoy than action-oriented crowd."

Who even thought a thriller set in a care home would be a good idea?! The plot is so thin and predictable that even an amateur film writer would be ashamed of this...film?!"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10375916/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","2"," One of the worst films of the year. ","I took a chance on a newly released film called Night of the Sicario aka Blindsided. I would think it would be at least somewhat watchable because it s released by Paramount.Its about a young Colombian girl (whos mother is going to testify against a cartel) takes refuge at a retirement home. Natasha Henstridge is the main caretaker there who tries to protect her. Bad guys with guns track her down and try to take her out but the old timers there try to go against them. Its a really dumb and dopey mix of dull action and boring drama. One scene I swear has one victim bleed bright purple blood! Its so bad Im surprised Bruce Willis did not play the cop."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10375916/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," Not very much was put into this. ","I agree with poor details being distracting. There were so many little things that just wouldn't happen the way they did, it was very poorly thought out and choreographed. Natasha does have potential, but with so much wrong with the movie and those over it, not much was believable. I had a bunch of points, but kept turning it off and going back to finish it to see if anything was redeeming, so I got mind numbed by it. I do remember this, though, the girl walks slowly around while killers are near, the killers walk slowly and just stop to relax, no one leaves the house with killers about, the girl & Natasha laugh and reminisce while killers are around.... I wanted to pull my hair out... stuff like this and bad gun scenes etc. Are all this has."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10375916/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","1"," DO NOT WATCH THIS ","I cannot even know where to begin with this. The movie started with a promising start and I was hands on deck that this would be a great thriller but literally after the first encounter with the cartels the director just lost it. I mean even teenagers at a high school could have made a much better movie. Bottom line is do not waste your time and by pass this."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10375916/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","3"," Like most of the bullets in this movie....it misses ","First of all, this is not part of, or a sequel to those other Sicario movies, Secondly, the director must think his audience are a pack of idiots. I found the details in this movie distracting, like, when it's raining, it only rains on them, but in the background, it clearly shows no rain, or a wild storm, that only happens in the foreground. Ridiculous gun fights, where so many bullets are fired at close range, but find no target, and they seemed to have enough ammo with them to start a small war. Then there's the actors, none of who convinced me of anything other than obviously needing more acting classes. The more I think about it, the worse it gets.If you like, or are expecting a good action movie, then avoid this drivel."

The acting is extremely poor - like high school level whereas the scenario is laughable and doesn't make much sense.The only reason I start watching this movie is because sometimes a 4 star action movie can be digested. I had to recover my IMDB password just to leave this scenario and save a man or a girl from the worst movie I've seen in the last couple of years.I am positive that the cast and technicians vote for this movie to bump it out from a score of maximum 2 stars. And yeah, there is that, the main actress Natasha Henstridge gain considerable weight. Good for her or whatever, it is just shocking to see a model actress gaining 100+ pounds."

Petrov is not feeling well: his entire family are suffering from flu during a pandemic (a concept all audience members can surely relate to) and he gets sicker as the day goes on. The film's realistic narrative and verit-style gradually give way to a story that weaves in memory, dream and fantasy in a subtle and compelling way.

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10380900/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Witty, beautiful and ultimately sincere ","To be honest, I don't really watch modern Russian movies, maybe one/two in a year, mostly due not very good reputation of the Russian film industry (the biggest, most expensive, advertised movies are quite often unforgivably bad and poor acted), but this one grabbed my attention. Firstly because it went to the Cannes, secondly because it sets in my hometown (Yekaterinburg) and after Cannes was premiered here earlier that anywhere else. So, I heard about this movie everywhere and the synopsis only increased my interest. I went to the cinema with a fear that I will be very very disappointed (again), BUT, to my big pleasure, Petrov's Flu is a very fine movie.The story (which is based on novel by Alexey Salnikov) is mainly about a typical family, all members of which caught flu just before the New Year celebration. The plot is a mix of every-day-life situations, fantasies, hallucinations, flashbacks involving vampires, aliens, bloody killings, everything what a delirious mind could think of.This movie astonishes you by it's craziness and unpredictability, but yet remains truthful to the what it represents. Serebryakov skillfully draws a picture of the middle and lower class people living in the provincial Russian city. Scenes in public transport are especially authentic, showing to audience the variety of characters and it's behaviours (a little bit exaggerated ones) distinctive for Russian realities. There are plenty of humorous and absurd situations mixed up with a philosophical "kitchen" talks about life, family, religion, politics, every other aspect of human existence, which so ingenuously conveys unique nature of nation.Can't help but mention the cinematography, it's immaculate, so many interesting transitions, you can see an own well-developed author's style. The landscapes of the city are kind of theatrical, exaggeratedly dark, poor and dirty as if this is some made up city in a comic book like Gotham, what perfectly connects with the grotesqueness of the events shown in the movie.Last, but not least, the acting. This part in modern Russian movies upsets me most often and I can't always tell why I didn't like a particular performance. At the first sight everything is fine, but something is off, like, you don't see real people, you see actors do their job and you just can't empathise with their characters because you fully aware that this is fiction and the magic of the cinema just disappears. !! BUT!!this movie is another case. For the first time IN A WHILE I really believed every word spoken, every move made on a screen. And that was the best feeling ever, knowing that there are some good actors and filmmakers left in this country.That kind of movie for sure will not leave anyone indifferent. It's authentic, provoking, unique experience I 100 pro-cent recommend you to try."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10380900/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," Amazing and unpredictable film on russian reality ","Last night I watched Russian film. Name of film - Petrov's flu, very actual, because autumn is time when all people sick.ver This film had a difficult genre. It is mix genre: comedy, horror, thriller, romantic and etc. Finally I thought Petrov's flu is art movie from great modern director - Kirill Serebryanikov.Film cast is very strong. A lot popular Russian actors starred in that film: amazing Chulpan Khamatova, interesting Yuri Kolokolnikov (I met this actor for Games of Thrones), Yuriy Borisov, Varvara Shmykova and Yuliya Peresild.The film story about typical family suffering flu. The plot is big mix fantasy and reality. Viewers see aliens, violent kills and memories main character.I liked all special effects and atmosphere soundtrack from modern Russian singers.Dialogue is very funny and humorous. Director created very unpredictable plot. All film I not taked my eyes off the screen.For me this film is moving, because I born 90's at South Ural in post-soviet time. In the moment subjective camera I really felt me child. It's unique experience for me.My overall opinion. It is gripping, spectacular film full of strong statements and images.If you want knew real Russian reality, be sure to watch."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10381014/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Those who climb on the backs of the fallen and claim to be patriots ","This film is based on the true story of William Hackett (Sam Hazeldine ) a miner during WWI. The British were losing because the Germans built their bunkers deep. The only way to get to them would be digging tunnels. William Hackett, rejected three times for service, lead a group of miners under German bunkers.I enjoyed this film more than 1917. Good war film.Guide: No sex or nudity. Didn't catch any swearing."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10381014/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," a pretty intense... ","First world war drama ,in the fields of no mansland, soldiers life in the trenches of mud and decay, rats and the proud underground workers serving under the colonels wings in the ranks of king edward/george?(cant remember) the king of the british empire, where the coal miners excavate tunnels under the german lines to blast the into never land.Its a dangerous job digging, also the danger of crossing the line of german mining moles does amplify the scares. So its about silence in everything you do, unless you might get killed by an earthskott.Story and production is well taken care of, the detailed background war theater that usually is a lowdown on past productions,do seem very realistic here. To be squemish i think the spoken english is far to modern, some dialect coaching couldve made it more timely of the era.Intens and feels like never ending, and shows some of the forgotten sons of the king and country, they didnt win the war, they just laid the foundation for it. A good film good style and at times quite breathless moment for a grumpy old man. Recommended."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10381014/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","1"," Yeah right! ","A British officer proposes that 5 ordinary blokes from a pit village dig a tunnel under a machine gun nest which was bit of a bother and blow it up. Those General chappies are not convinced and try to scupper those salt of the Earth but slovenly Yorkshiremen or wherever they are from. But they succeed and their reward is to dig a bigger tunnel under the German lines at Messines which would wipe out 10,000 Germans.But after a battle with German counter miners and bombs flying everywhere they again succeed and those General chappies take the credit.If only the British Army had a dedicated arm used to large scale civil works and tunnelling. A Royal Engineers so to speak. But no there was nobody for the job but these 5 ordinary blokes.The Germans were way behind us as they had a group of Munich drapers and a bakers assistant led by a florist from a small town in Saxony to head their tunnelling effort.An absolute insult to the real brave men on both sides who fought and died underground.The acting was not great but the script was hopeless. The lead miner kept sending military secrets back to his wife including how he was going to set off the largest explosion known to man under the Germans. The censors seemed to miss stuff like that.The tunnel scenes were not up to much either as the same 5 people kept getting into bother and scrapes it was hard to imagine they were still able to dig.Watch Beneath Hill 60 if you want to get an inkling as to what it was like.This was utter nonsense."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10381014/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," Highly underrated, great movie ","It simply has everything in the right place. It's a combination of a great story of real selfless sacrifice, a good script and excellent acting.Could the end result be any better? Sure. If they had the budget for million-dollar special effects and A-list actors, the eye-candy value would be higher. But this is a war movie, about real people who gave their lives for others. It's not Candy Crush."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10381014/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Decent, based on real events, a bit clichd ","Excellent acting and I'm glad to see an event like this actually covered (see also Beneath Hill 60), but this movie was a bit of a disappointment, employing every modern war movie clich there is. And quite a few general modern movie plot clichs.While what happens in the movie, did happen, the even involved a lot more than half a dozen men. And there was little thought that it could possibly end the war. In other words, the whole deal is semi-accurate and there are obvious attempts to heighten the drama throughout.I'm of the opinion that when you're portraying a monumental event, you don't need all the rigmarole. The event itself supplies more than enough if you just allow it to.A nice try, but not up to the standards of Dunkirk and 1917. Better than the cartoonish Midway and Pearl Harbor. They could probably trim a half hour to 45 minutes and make it a much better movie.See Beneath Hill 60 which I have not seen, but features a similar plot."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10381014/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Inspired by true events ","This is the first movie I've seen that was focusing on this topic - digging a tunnel to the German trenches. Up to this point, I've only ever read about the sorts of daring actions these coal miners did in the trenches in WWI.The production value was high. It really did manage to convey what life was like for the diggers in these trenches. But even so, I'm sure it was no where near representing how it was really like in real life. But it was done well in this movie. It's realism clearly exceeding the realism of any recent war movies - particularly when compared to movies like "Dunkirk" by Chris Nolan.Other pluses from this movie... the acting was superb, the drama and atmosphere created with all the special effects and set designs, simply brilliant.SUMMARY: Inspired by true events with the war serving as the backdrop The main story is the courage, sacrifices and contribution the coal miners did in WWI.VERDICT: Recommended viewing - specially if you're a history/war buff."

I personally was enthralled from start to finish, having toured the Somme 3 times in years past, this film managed to accurately depict what I personally presume represents a WW1 battlefield.There are a few minor points such as the lads always being clean, but everything else from the insignia to the interaction between officers and soldiers (not many officers were aloof when they spent a tour in the trenches with their 'chaps' eating the bully beef and sharing the lice and rats!) were spot on.All in all a solid, decent watch and totally worth a revisit in a few months... perhaps with the wife :-P."

I know one of them and he's a top bloke.The film itself is really good, some nice realistic touches and the insignias are all spot on as far as I can see. They've obviously used some creative license with following just one team of tunnellers but I guess that's a practical thing as well as for story.

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10381014/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," Decent production values but tone feels off ","I feel a great opportunity was missed here to really capture the raw terror and emotion of this story, but unfortunately it ended up missing the mark.The biggest thing I noticed was that the demeanor of the miners when they reached the frontline seemed off. You would expect civilian contractors to be truly terrified and horrified by what they have walked into, but they quickly seemed more irritated and annoyed by the horrors of trench warfare, which I found odd. A lot of effort was clearly put into trying to re-create a realistic set, but the character development and the psychological trauma of being in a war zone was poorly handled.I also didn't get the big emphasis on having "experienced miners" carry out the tunneling operation as if they were bringing in some kind of specialized techniques or equipment, when all they seemed to be using were shovels and sacks. In reality, I'm sure this was not the case during the actual events, but this was really not portrayed well in the movie."
