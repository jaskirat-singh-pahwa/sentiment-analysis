"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10418662/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," solution too obvious ","Jill (Gina Rodriguez) steals expired drugs from work. She's on probation for drugs and was forced to surrender custody of her two children to her mother. It's a struggle to stay on the straight and narrow. Something happens and all the electronics in the world are rendered inoperative. Then something worst happens. Nobody can sleep. Dr. Murphy (Jennifer Jason Leigh) leads a military operation to find a cure.Anybody remember The Quiet Earth (1985). The two premises have a lot of similarities. The problem with this movie is that the solution is obvious right from the start. The story needs to hide that. It can't show its hand. It makes Jill look stupid to not realize something so obvious. The other problem is having annoying stupid kids. It's a minor problem which exists a lot of times and I'm willing to overlook it. I can't overlook the fact that nobody would be stupid enough to not see what makes Matilda different. In the end, I'm a sucker for this type of high concept sci-fi. It could done better. I wish the kids are less annoying especially the boy. I do like Jill trying to teach Matilda how to survive. It's a good sci-fi writing exercise but it does need some minor tweaks."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10418662/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," You need to be woke ","The world "blinks" as all microchips are fried, the electric goes out, and all of a sudden no one can sleep. The story centers on single mother Jill (Gina Rodriguez) and her family as they fight to survive a world gone mad from lack of sleep. They were involved in a car accident at the time of the incident. Matilda (Ariana Greenblatt) has no trouble sleeping through this film, and neither should you. The "hub" wants to study her to save the world before it is too late.It was nice to see crowds going crazy for sleeping pills instead of toilet paper for a change. I thought the acting was good. The cause was credible to lay people. I wish they had done more with the plot.Guide: F-word. Nudity."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10418662/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Sleepless ","A really interesting main and central idea ... what would happen if for some reason we couldn't sleep anymore? And would there be some people who were immune to that? Also would that be mother nature getting rid of us? So many questions, almost none will be answered to most viewers satisfaction I reckon.The movie is anything but perfect and filled with cliches. Predictable and sort of weird in not a good sense at places. Convenient road interactions aside and the ever reliable bad military trope ... there is fun to be had, if you suspend your disbelief and make it work yourself."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10418662/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," Lots of potential that ended up in mediocrity... ","Sure, "Awake" was watchable, but the movie was just one of those movie that you watch once, because it is adequately entertaining, but then you forget about the movie and never return to it again.And that is because there were just way too many things in the movie that made so little sense. I especially found it ludicrous that society would break out in anarchy after such a short time. Sure, I get that staying awake for prolonged periods of time starts to affect the brain, but come on, for people to start looting, killing each other and such, nah, that was just a bit too far fetched.The storyline in "Awake" definitely had some interesting enough aspects. But ultimately, then writers Joseph Raso, Mark Raso and Gregory Poirier just managed to come up with a mediocre storyline.I will say that the acting performances put on in "Awake" were fair, and while I am not overly familiar with actress Gina Rodriguez, she actually carried the movie quite well with her performance.I had expected a bit more from director Mark Raso with this 2021 movie. Sure, it made for an adequate enough watch, but it just wasn't a wow-moment.My rating of "Awake" lands on a bland five out of ten stars."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10418662/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," A better than average end of the world film ","This is one of those films where something terrible happens so everybody goes completely nuts and a single mom has to save her children. I don't understand why in movies whenever something world altering happens, Americans start shooting each other almost immediately, but that's what all of them show, including Awake. Then there are the children, which are always incredibly dumb and put everybody in danger multiple times and only survive because it's in the script. Children are usually less experienced than adults, but they are not all idiots.However, all that aside, the film was quite good for its genre. It was acted OK, it had a clear and concise story, it only lasted one hour and a half and the main character wasn't an emotional wreck crying and needing to be saved all the time either. Was it a good film in general? Not really, but I've stopped wishing for intelligence and complexity in disaster movies a long time ago.Bottom line: a very simple premise that needed no special effects or mumbo jumbo, a linear and well produced storyline, decent acting. For this type of movie, it was a lot better than the average."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10418662/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," A Movie that Crushes Dreams ","It's as though the actors were sleepwalking through their parts.... Now that I got that out of my system, given that "Awake" is apocalyptically about people suddenly no longer being able to sleep, it's ironic I saw it when I was quite tired myself but unable to nod off. Perhaps, that affected my critical thinking, as sleep deprivation assuredly does the characters here, so that's my caveat before I pan this rubbish. I've also gone without snoozing for more than 48 hours before, so I know for a fact that it'd at least take longer than that--assuming such would ever happen--until I lost my mind to the point of going on a paranoid killing spree or starting a child-sacrifice cult. Not so with characters in this movie, though, as the disintegration of society, albeit accelerated by the complimentary loss of electronics, escalates way too quickly. Otherwise, the extinction narrative is entertaining enough, I suppose, and the ultimate resolution is rather amusing. I could overlook whatever other minor problems, too, including that needless temporary avoidance of showing a male doctor and minor character's face in one scene, if there were something more clever underneath it all. Again, I was fatigued, but I didn't see anything like that.That's what comparisons to another Netflix release, "Bird Box" (2018), are missing. Sure, both threaten the existence of humanity, feature people going nuts and otherwise losing an ability, and are anchored by a woman finding maternal redemption by guiding a son and a daughter through the newfound disorder on their quest for refuge. With "Bird Box," however, the lost sense is sight, lest one be terrified by suicidal nightmares. Gimmicky, perhaps, but quite cinematically reflexive, as motion pictures are primarily a visual art form. Similar to another such movie, "Blindness" (2008), in that way. Dreams are also associative with movies. Yet, "Awake" squanders any opportunity there by eradicating dreaming. Even for those who can sleep, we're never welcomed into that internal space. The closest we get is a case of delirium.It's "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" (1956, 1978, 1993, 2007), but reversed, to the exclusion of anything intelligent. With the body snatchers, also nominally from space, as with the supposed solar flare cause here, and which also doesn't really matter, the result was the same that the heroes avoided slumber. But, that was merely the story that seemed to hide a pod containing something much deeper. Whether that's the common interpretations of political allegory, psychological ones, or the reflexivity of sleep being equated with a death of acting and replacement by other actors, or the argument I supported in my reviews that the brilliance was merely in its offering itself for interpretation, the point is that the better "Body Snatchers" films are complex and thoughtful. "Awake" is not; indeed, in removing critical thinking and dreams, it's quite the opposite."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10418662/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Decent thriller. ","3 out of 5 stars.Awake is a fair thriller film about a cataclysmic event that causes everyone to have difficulty sleeping. Which people become delusional and insane. While the main character and her daughter are trying to find a solution before they lose there minds.Decent plot. Boring script that gives forgettable characters. And dull direction."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10418662/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt"," A refreshingly non-Hollywoodish realistic-feel sort-of-sci-fi. ","Wow the the critics went real hard on this one. I was fully engaged, and in a state of anxiety and suspense from start to finish.As a hardcore sci-fi fan, this isn't one of those Hollywood-styled futuristic aliens and spaceships take over the world type film. But instead, something more current and relatable (solar flares) and down to earth. When you hear about a film that includes world-wide unexplained insomniacs, you assume just another zombie movie. I'm really grateful that wasn't the case here, as I'm tired of zombie movies - unless they are funny and include Woody Harrelson in them. In fact, I felt the story's concept was brilliant and well executed.The 96 min runtime was just right and paced perfectly. This film was shot really well, with great cinematography, and a very fitting and decent score. Mad props to the director and writers - all fairly newb filmmakers, for creating non-stop anxiety and suspense right from the get go. Casting and performances were on point, with Rodriguez at her best, playing a mother trying to teach her daughter fast-tracked end-of-the-world survival skills, but stealing the show was the young Ariana Greenblatt as Matilda, who was outstanding.Many didn't like the ending, which I couldn't understand why, because I thought it ended perfectly, with the option left open for a part two. Fingers crossed! It's well deserved 8/10 from me."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10418662/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," Standard Netflix Production ","Some people compare Awake with Bird Box (S. Bullock) but whereas I was highly entertained and thrilled by the latter one (my rate: 7), I watched Awake rather drowned in an ocean of indifference. Awake simply lacks of thrill and action and the story told unfolds very slowly and there are just too many scenes and dialogues that are all cliche in. In this sense Awake reminds me a lot of Greenland (2020, Gerard Butler), which also tells us a story that works more or less on auto-pilot: scenes after scenes we watched million times before. In short: the script is (like in so many movies these days) the weakest link (the ending is not only a cheap twist but a joke too), and whereas movies like Bird Box or The Road are top contributions to the genre of post-apocalyptic movies, Awake sails close on the edge of boredom.Last note: the writer and director should have done some experiments with sleep deprivation: I managed 10 days (back then in my younger years) without the necessity of a visit of a mental institute and/or the notion to run havoc or beat up my fellow humans ;)"

","Really good watch, could watch again, and can recommend.This is no "Day 5" (A Rooster Teeth series where people who fall asleep never wake again). This is more like a twisted opposite of that, but still interesting. Watching characters slowly go insane has a certain level of appeal to it when it comes to stories. It's an onboard clock to how far the story can be pushed.The cast does a great job of leaning into the characters and their situations, the story itself is decent, but does lean quite a bit on the concept alone.The movie distracts from it's main plot from being about a mom and her two kids, this creates dependencies that wouldn't usually exist in apocalyptic survivor groups. It allows for some predictability as well as limiting in what is sensible for the characters to do.The movie compensates well enough and the bigger problem, to me is the "special child" trope it uses.Definitely worth a watch, and refreshing to see a somewhat innovative idea come along."

[+34%] ","I did not like Bird Box (another NETFLIX apocalypse movie) and I certainly did not like this one. Apart from Gina Rodriguez's convincing performance (in the latter half) as an insomniac, there's nothing holding the film together. Characters lack motivation, scenes lack tension, the solution(s) to the film's core issues lack credibility. It's a shame because Awake has an intriguing premise. In the hands of a more capable writer-director, this could have turned out a lot better. Even the (occasionally dysfunctional) 'family' angle is poorly developed, which in turn, does away with the emotional connection between viewers and the protagonists. Jennifer Jason Leigh is completely wasted once again (after The Woman in the Window). Oh, and there's some unintentional humour too!"

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10418662/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," An interesting enough hook undermined by underdeveloped characters, a miscast lead, and workman like structure. ","Troubled veteran Jill Adams (Gina Rodriguez) and her estranged children, Noah and Mathilda (Lucius Hoyos and Ariana Greenblatt respectively), face a strange event that disables communications and infrastructure and leaves all of humanity in a state of insomnia. As society breaks down, Jill finds that her daughter Mathilda is able to sleep and learning of military controlled hub where another "sleeper" is being studied sets out to on a last ditch effort to save her family in a world gone mad from sleeplessness.Awake, the new feature from Copenhagen and Kodachrome writer-director Mark Raso and his brother co-writer Joseph Raso of Disney Channel's Zombies TV movie franchise carries an interesting hook with a pandemic of insomnia having gripped humanity. While there's probably a good story utilizing that concept somewhere, Awake unfortunately isn't it as it's a plodding predictable slog that hits all the standard beats of a film like this with little if any personality added to them.Awake feels like it's cut from a similar cloth to something like Bird Box or A Quiet Place where it wants to take recognized hurdle (in this case insomnia) and build an apocalyptic or post-apocalyptic story around it. Unlike Bird Box, A Quiet Place, or The Silence this isn't a monster movie and the threat comes more from societal breakdown with film's such as The Trigger Effect, Blindness, or to some extent Stephen King's The Mist serving as apt comparisons wherein humanity is arguably a greater threat. I think the filmmaker's may have realized their premise doesn't have all that much meat to it because the movie feels really rush with society breaking down to near The Purge levels of insanity and mayhem within the first 20 minutes of screen time. None of the societal breakdown elements are all that interesting and are pretty much done with the bare minimum of effort and we have pretty much all the familiar stand-bys of the genre with religious fanatics, looters, roving prisoners, and rogue military units all serviving as the standard apocalypse obstacles that would be all well and good if the build up or characters were the least bit interesting, but not only is everything too rushed with the scenario escalating from 1-11 before we even know the main character's names (seriously) but the characters are so one dimensional that it's impossible to care.Gina Rodriguez of TV's Jane the Virgin tries to play against type in a role similar Tom Cruise's in War of the Worlds or John Cusack's in 2012 and unfortunately it's clear it doesn't fit her at all. While I do like Gina Rodriguez as an actress, she is hopelessly miscast as a hard edge ex-military burnout and just doesn't convey the needed intensity to sell this role, in a way it's sort of the opposite situation that plagued Mark Wahlberg's performance in M. Night Shyamalan's The Happening abeit less funny. Lucius Hoyos and Ariana Greenblatt playing Jill's are incredibly bland basically playing variations on the emotionally distant teenage son (complete with calling his mother by her first name as an act of "rebellion") and the precocious daughter who thanks to her status as a sleeper serves as less a character and more a combination macguffin and deus ex Machina (which the audience will be WAY ahead of the characters in figuring out). There are brief performances by actors who try to give some substance to underwritten roles such as Barry Pepper as a former drug addict turned Pastor who tires to keep his congregation from resorting to extremism in what's a nice change of play against type for this type of character, but he's gone from the movie after maybe 3 or 4 minutes (probably for the best for his sake). Shamier Anderson of Syfy's Wyonna Earp as Dodge plays a reformed convict who protects our heroes from the evil convicts and does fine for the most part, but it's such an underwritten role any goodwill from the character basically comes more from actor than character.Awake has a mildly intriguing premise, but doesn't have any idea where to take it or how to explore it and settles for generic apocalypse road movie tropes. Gina Rodriguez is miscast in a role that doesn't play to her strengths and while there are a few decent performances from reliable character actors most of the supporting performances range from bland to unintentionally funny. The movie isn't unintentionally funny like The Happening, doesn't try to make any allegorical or satirical point like Blindness or The Trigger Effect, nor does it try to be over the top exploitation like The Purge, it's just a bland by the numbers point A-B thriller designed to take up space and be forgotten."

","Movie Review: RushedIN A NUTSHELL: Barbara O'Brien, an Irish Catholic mother, has her life turned upside-down when her son, a freshman in college, is involved in a tragic hazing incident.As always, this is a spoiler-free review.THINGS I LIKED: Siobhan Fallon Hogan is STELLAR! She was PERFECT in this role as a fierce mother. As a mother, I love how dedicated she was to her family. Many would say she smothered her kids but I absolutely understand the feeling of wanting to be a part of your kids' lives even when they grow up and move away. It's hard to let go of those apron strings. I was blown away to learn that she also wrote the screenplay. Her performance reminded me of Francis McDermott. She was that good. I really loved her in this. The first time I ever saw her was in Men In Black where she says "Sugar water" in such a funny way that my family still laughs when we repeat that line.It's always good to see Robert Patrick. He'll forever be a Terminator to me.Jay Jay Warren does a great job in his role.The last sentence out of Barbara's mouth was profound and very well done.I recognized Peri Gilpin's voice long before I recognized her face. I don't think I've seen her since her famous role as "Roz" in Frasier: The Complete Series. I've always enjoyed her performances and I loved that TV show.It was symbolic that the mom prayed every day to the Virgin Mary, feeling a special bond with her as a mother. She lit candles, prayed "the rosary", and even talked to her like a friend. She could relate to the mother of God because she was a mother.Noticeably good direction. Some of the camera angles were so insightful.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE: Why would anyone want to join a fraternity that had a bunch of total douchebags in it? The president of the fraternity, played by Jake Weary couldn't even complete a sentence without an F-bomb. Why would you want to hang out with people like that?The topic feels dated. I remember hearing about all of these hazing deaths back in the 1980s. Because of the severity and frequency of them, the university where I attended college eventually decided to not allow the Greek system on campus at all. My roommate rushed a sorority our freshman year. She was forced to do embarrassing things which made me see how stupid it was to lower your dignity and self-respect just to hang out with supposed "cool" people.Some of the subplots are completely dropped and you're left with unanswered questions.The uneven tone of the movie changes from Act 1 (drama) to Act 2 (dark comedy) to Act 3 (thriller). Some viewers are criticizing the twist in Act 3.TIPS FOR PARENTS: Lots of profanity and F-bombs LOTS and lots of alcohol Drug use Sorrow MourningYou can see my full review on my Movie Review Mom YouTube channel."

A Rushed series would allow Siobhan Fallon Hogan to expound much more deeply her writing and allow the Hogans(and Robert Patrick) more opportunity to fine tune their production skills, so that other Emerald Caz Productions project can feel more polished and defined."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10430850/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," Loose ends family drama without closure.. ","A technically well made film with An exiting build-up, thatt, helas, ends up as an unsatisfactory TV movie level opportunities missed production.. In spite of especially the mother's good acting performance. The way too smoothly finale leaves us behind with all sorts of major unanswered script storyline questions as, has anything ever been done with all of the collected interviews video material of all of the other grieving mothers ? Was the frat leader ever sentenced ? Was the senator ever exposed ? Even if only a fictional individual case, still with so many loose ends that it brings down what could have easily been a film of real depth into large scale current issues contents value to the level of little more than a simple sentimental family drama, a pulp fiction tale of not even a decently elaborate revenge. The family members themselves and their interactions are so overly romantized that even while under alledged extreme pressure no-one ever looses control of their emotions.And while the siblings of the victim just keep on smiling, the dad, who is presumed to be some kind of former hardman, does is nothing at all, he just continues to go to work and takes absolutely no action whatsoever.. With, as a result, that I personally, with the exception of them mom, couldn't identify to any of the other family members as real world people at all. And last but not least, I do think the director of this movie does show talent and promise indeed, but that a lot of professionalism could definitely be gained by learning how to make ends meet. Because in the end, the fact that no justice has been served, no promises to any of the other victims have been kept, and absolutely nothing has changed for the better, did leave me personally behind with the sensation of having enjoyed a wonderful appetizer while the main course never came.. And since all we are left with is the picture of the fairy content remains of our (never arguing with eachother about anything) modern day Waltons family, going back to business as usual as like almost nothing had happened at all, I suppose it would probably be best if we viewers would simply do exactly the same."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10430850/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," A very good film that could have been a great film ","The acting is outstanding, as is the story up until the ambiguous ending. Nothing is really resolved.Some things felt contrived. At the party, when it was clear Jimmy needed medical help, his friend Virgil asked for his phone back with an increasing sense of urgency. But it was only the pledges who had their phones taken away. He could have easily borrowed a phone from one of the girls at the party or he could have ran next door and called an ambulance. There were options. It's not until the film is almost over that Virgil tells Jimmy's father what actually happened at the party. When Jimmy's mother kidnaps Jake to get the truth out of him, we don't know what he tells her. Does he admit to spiking Jimmy's beer and tying him up? Who knows? Did Virgil tell the police what happened at the party? Did they even bother to ask him? Again, we don't know. The only thing we learn about the police investigation is from the letter where the college denies responsibility. Did they know Jimmy had been tied up and had shots involuntarily poured down his throat? Everyone saw it, so if the police didn't know does that mean the investigation was sloppy or that everyone at the party lied? Did they have the photos that Virgil showed Jimmy's dad? Did they know that Jake tried to stop anyone from calling an ambulance? There are simply too many unanswered questions about what the police knew.Siobhan Fallon Hogan's performance was Academy Award-winning level. She was very convincing as a distraught, mourning, devoutly Catholic mother. Robert Patrick was great in his smaller role as well. Aside from the fantastic acting, the other thing that really stood out was the brilliant score. I recommend this film, but be prepared for an unsatisfying ending. I would have preferred that mom murdered or kneecapped Jake, or that the kidnapping convinced the police to take another look at Jimmy's death and conclude there was criminal culpability, resulting in Jake's arrest."

There's no closure, no justice which is what this films lacks. I do believe had they done this film with a better ending or better revenge part there would be Oscar buzz but it falls flat at the end.

I hadn't even heard about the movie prior to getting to sit down to watch it. I have to say, though, that I was suckered in by the movie's cover.And let me just say that this was bad. Really, really bad. The storyline felt like it was written by a pre-teen as a term paper. It was just ludicrous that writer and director Ken May managed to churn out something as ridiculous as "Future Fear" turned out to be.I am sure that the idea was well-meant and that the concept sounded great in the head of writer and director, but the transition from idea to screen was just horrible.The special effects in the movie were awful to look at. It felt as if they didn't even bother with attempting to make it look realistic. And how such effects get a clearance stamp in post-production is just beyond my comprehension.The acting in "Future Fear" was every bit as wooden, rigid and cringe-worthy as the rest of the movie. So at least they were on point with that.If you enjoy sci-fi horror movies, don't waste your time, money or effort on this one. There are far, far better movies out there in the sci-fi horror genre.I am rating "Future Fear" a generous two out of ten stars. At least they tried, I suppose.

The performances from Chloe Warmoth and Riley Warmoth hit all the right notes, and the soaring shots displaying the beauty of the Michigan landscape and the affecting score create the perfect framework to tell this important story. An ambitious and effective debut for first-time director Riley Warmoth; I can't wait to see what's next."

","I was told (in a couple of different ways by a couple of different people) to remember that this was a low budget, indie film but honestly . . . I liked it as much as I've liked some major motion pictures.Chole Ray Warmouth is nothing short of incandescent and the cinematography is absolutely, stunningly, perfectly executed.I enjoyed the storyline very much and thought the script was very well done, though I worry the title of the film might not draw people into the (important) subject matter as much as it possibly could.But that's a very small consideration and overall this was a simply beautifully done project."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10448124/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," Beautiful Story, Must See ","True feeling of love, anxiety, depression, desperation, hurt, joy and triumph were felt viewing this film. Hannah struggles with depression and suicidal thoughts while her brother Charle struggles to connects, relate and communicate with Hannah. Charlie could sense Hannah was not okay, however, he didn't push Hannah to open up. I found Hannah's and Charlie's characters very relatable. When a person is depressed or suicidal they rarely speak openly about this to anyone, especially their loved ones. This is a burden they carry alone. We as the viewers do not get to know exactly why Hannah has these feelings. I find this true to life. It is impossible to know what another person is going through that may be affecting their mental health. A viewer going through rough times can see their struggles in Hannah's struggles. Leaving this part of the story line open for interpretation created an opportunity for the viewer to fill the blank; making the story even more relatable."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10448124/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," A Must See! ","Excellent movie with a very talented and amazing cast and crew. The dynamic sibling relationship between Hannah ( Chloe Warmoth) and Charlie (Riley Warmoth) mirrors many real life situations as both are on their journey toward adulthood. In the waterfall scene Charlie points out that the "water going over the falls looks dirty but the copper in the soil only make it appear that way." Decisions when growing up are not always clean and neat but many times messy. Hannah called out Charlie saying "I want you to care". She was expressing her depressed feelings toward others. The fabulous Cinematography and Music incorporated by the films writer Riley Warmoth made the screen come alive."

Even weirder, the investigation into this man vanishing from sight was closed in just two weeks.A lot of the fun of watching films at Fantastic Fest has been not knowing what I'm getting into. Sometimes you're watching a movie about nuns that quickly pivots, other times you're following the story of Gwar and then, still other times, you wind up in the middle of foreign crime series that you had no idea existed.I'm here for all of it."

But when the rest of the crew around him acts more or less in the same fashion it simply gets boring and uninteresting. Where Assad were much more involved, and a individual character in the first films, he is reduced to a weak voice in the background and a boring sidekick.Rosa is also tuned dowfrom a strong and independent woman in the first films, to an uninteresting and forgettable supporting role.The plot is obvius and you have to struggle not to doze off while you see it.If you have not seen the first films, go check them out and give this one a wide berth."

The head police chief is normally the most cruel gangster boss in other shows and movies and I couldn't wrap my head around him being on the good side.The coloring are dark and grey and is not very eye pleasing, but that must be the choice. I couldn't really differ the scenes from one another until the movie has some intensity at the end and the scenes had almost no life except his nicotine gum chewing.The story is so bad to me, I believe the book is another thing. It was so slow but so little pleasing.Such a disappointment. Absolutely the worst of the Afdeling Q-films and the previous are another level of entertainment.This one is more dark and grey but even not very original or anything to me like for instance when I saw the first Stieg Larsson film.There is nothing that made me interested beside the main character. Even the Roma-culture could be showed more and give more depth and color. I didn't understand where the little boy was from and why he went to Copenhagen with another passport. I didn't get most of the characters in the movie and why they appeared.Why where the Roma group so aggressive and how could the boss speak Danish?Another thing is that it is that maybe 90% of the outside scenes are in Czech Republic which make it not much of a Danish film and it is not very true to the viewer. I think it is a franchise for the International market so I may live with that."

I tried my best to keep watching, but fell asleep roughly 90 minutes in, and didn't bother watching the rest when I woke up 2 hours later.I genuinely wanted to like it, because I liked the first 4 movies, but I didn't, and I'm pretty sure I won't be watching the following movies....

Ulrich Thomasen is such a good actor. Here he's a pathetic idiot. Jussi Adler-Olsen, your involvement in this movie has not made it better. Do what you do best, and keep writing great novels.

I thought this movie is more true to the book than its predecessors.I think the bad rating and bad reviews are due to people having a hard time with change.If this film had been the first in the series, it would have received a better rating and better reviews."

This one's a buddy-cop type thriller which sees a couple of soldiers posted to Eastern Europe to battle a terrorist insurrection. The main guy is a newcomer to acting and it shows, although Anthony Mackie is better in the show-off cyborg role. The first half is a little much when it comes to the plotting, but it segues into fun, JOHN WICK-style action in the second half and there's a lot of it too."

America is trying to keep the peace in Eastern Europe especially Ukraine. In addition to aerial drones, the military is also using robotic soldiers called Gumps. Drone pilot Harp (Damson Idris) disobeys order and fires a missile close to the troupes killing two American soldiers. For his reprimand, he is reassigned to follow Captain Leo (Anthony Mackie) on an out-of-the-box ground mission to track down pro-Russian terrorist leader Victor Koval who aims to start a nuclear war.Ukraine doesn't have nukes. Even with the most outrageous conspiracy theory, nobody ever accuses Ukraine of having nukes. It doesn't make political sense. Russia wouldn't let them. The west would disown them. They had to decommission all their nukes before being allowed into the European economic system. I lay this down as my first point because it's indicative of the entire movie. This is trying to be a near future reality. It wants to be realistic. It's not. That gets annoying after awhile. Even with the food truck standoff, non of the combatants are taking cover. Everybody is standing out in the open and nobody is keeping an eye on the high ground. Once I realized that this is a dumb action movie, it does have its fun but the movie keeps thinking that it's smarter than it is. I love the Asimov conundrum being injected but it just reminds me that there is a smart script somewhere in here. It's smart one minute but gets dumb in the next. I also don't like the Gumps. Somebody would realize that it's useful for some Gumps to pack a bigger punch. They would at least have grenade launchers."

Leo is an android on a top secret mission to go after Viktor Kovel (Pilou Asbk) who is on a path to getting the launch codes for Russian nukes that are still in the Ukraine, apparently not the ones that were dismantled or moved out.The plot moved along just fine and then decided it needed to get cute with an unneeded twist.

Now visually and technically in general I'd say there is not much one can critisize here. On the story part though ... or at least the coherent storytelling ... that's a different story (no pun intended). This really is quite a stretch to say the least. And while Mackie does his best to keep the audience engaged (together with the rest of the cast, but I'd argue he's best ... equipped - again with the puns I know) ... unfortunately I'd say he is ... programmed to fail! Ok I'll stop, but I just couldn't help myself.So if you want to just shut off and enjoy some action on your screen, you could do worse. But I hear many already saying "why a 7? Why rate it so high?". Well the answer to that is, that I was entertained and not bothered too much by the flaws the movie. I understand if you feel otherwise. This is far removed from a masterpiece ..."

He is demoted down to a lower unit, to serve under the command of Captain Leo (Anthony Mackie), who has a human exterior, but is an android underneath. They are tasked with stopping warlord Victor Koval (Pilou Asbaek) who's purchased the codes to a nuclear arsenal. But the deeper he gets in to his mission, he learns everything is not as it seems.The theme of men and machines (and men versus machines, and vice versa) has been a constant theme for science fiction films since their conception, from The Terminator films to more recent fare like I, Robot, and a load of stuff before either. And it gets a fresh going over with this latest slick Netflix offering, a real above average but below exceptional effort that falls right in between.Opening, as it does, in the throes of a typically imperialist futuristic American war to destabilise democracy in a foreign land, it gives you a full visual assault of an all guns blazing war, with man and robot blasting away, but sadly at the expense of any great character development, leaving us indifferent to the central protagonist and his plight, or that of the charge he falls under. However, it compensates with a more intricate and multi layered plot than average, which holds your attention to the end.It's fair to say lead star Mackie has more than established himself as, if not quite a household name, one with enough star quality to carry his own movie, and this imperfect but worthwhile yarn is definitely another harmless notch on his belt. ***"

It had pretty cool concept and on paper i think it sounded way better, but the story overall is pretty lame and even kinda boring and did not lead to anything fresh or memorable.Action scenes were pretty descent. Acting was OK to say the best, and nothing more. But its the story were this movie suffered, because it was kinda boring to watch, and the dude who played with Anthony M. Has not much of charisma so it wasn't really involving to see his story either.Overall, "Outside the Wire" is not a terrible movie, and the execution of its action scenes is even pretty descent, but the story was not good. Also this movie dragged and at the running time 2 hours i was struggling to finish it. When i finally did it, i was disappointed by this movie."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10451914/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Mindless Action with Robots ","The problem with Netflix is that you watch a really good film so you decide to watch another one and the quality of it drops dramatically, but then again I probably shouldn't be all that surprised considering that there does happen to be a lot of rubbish when it comes to films on Netflix. I guess they have to have a catalogue of some sort to keep people subscribed to it. Anyway, this certainly wasn't anywhere near as bad as some of them, but it wasn't particularly top quality either.This film is set in the future where the Ukraine has descended into civil war and the Americans have been deployed to act as peace keepers. The army has developed robots that provide support to the ground troops, and of course you have a group of drone pilots as well. During a pitched battle, what looks like a rocket launcher turns up and a drone pilot disobeys orders and blows it up, resulting in the death of two soldiers. As such he is made to actually go out on the ground so that he can experience what it is like to be a ground troop.Anyway, he teams up with an advanced robot and goes on a mission to hunt down a rebel leader who is trying to gain hold of some Russian nukes, but most of the film deals with him interacting with this advanced robot, as well as getting into some rather pitched battles with the rebels. At first he is part of a convoy, but after an ambush they head off on their own to attempt to prevent the nukes from falling into the hands of the rebels.I have to say that when I was younger I would have loved watching films like this, particularly with the pitched battles and all that - and there were quite a few. However, it just feels as if explosions and machine gunfights, for the sake of explosions and machine gun fights can simply become rather dull. Still, this film wasn't all that bad, though it certainly wasn't on par with some of the other films that I have watched. I guess in the end it is just one of those films that you watch when there is nothing else to watch, which these days doesn't really happen all that much, especially considering that you have access to so many films that it is unlikely that there will be a time when you don't have something else to watch."

","And hard to define the enemy picture, its allright enough. try to count all the ammunition rounds fired and youll hit the 5000 level before youre fatigued to continue the count. acting are typically big brother takes you out anyway, but it gives the retired soldier of the norwegian medical core some insight in drone warfare and cybersurveillance, elsewise its the generic stuff of a future war film including cyborgs and robotniki en masse, but far from realistic and wont scare the average civillian viewer.as mentioned acting is pure average, some intense scenes here and there, but extremely hard to bond with any of the caracters. production are based on vfx and cgi availabel anno 2020, therefore no news for the squemish. the grumpy old man had no expectations to this film because the topic doesnt tempt me anylonger as they all lookalike so a weak 7 for this slavic based terror action drama"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10451914/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Decent action but forgettable story and flat direction ","3 out of 5 stars.Outside the Wire is a fair science fiction film that has a similiar concept like films Chappie or Robocop. Where a society is crumpling. Androids are taking over as militarized soldiers. And cyborgs being created.The plot follows a soldier Harp (Damson Idris) who made an irrational call on a operation. He gets reassigned to Leo (Anthony Mackie) who is an android soldier. And going to travel in a demilitarized zone to go after a terrorist group who are after nuclear codes.The plot is forgettable. There is a twist that does not make it any better. But plays with a concept idea of kill millions to save a better future idea.The action sequences is pretty decent and entertaining for action fans. Anthony Mackie does kick a** as an android soldier. Facing against bad guys. And other militarized robots. The visual effects are decent.The script does make the characters feel bland. And the direction is a bit flat. Which does not make the movie stand out or different. It does have some exciting action but story and direction does make this one film forgettable once it is over."

"," Missed the mark ","Two screenwriters couldn't come up with fluid, coherent, and exciting story. Riddled with plot and technical issues, and the long dragged out and unnecessary scenes, made the 114 min runtime feel never-ending, and that's with having a decent pacing.The concept was great, but the execution missed the mark. We go from a military gamer in a box, to single-handedly saving the world in melodramatic fashion. Ummm nope.Add some amateur directing, and the long dragged out and unnecessary scenes to that equation, and my 6/10 becomes very generous. Casting and performances were great, although Damson Idris' character towards the end was laughable as the "skinny geek saves the world" slow motion hero walk.This film needed the screenplay edited by a seasoned writer, and at least 20 mins cut out from its runtime. Too bad though, it was a great concept with awesome cinematography and S/VFX, which is where the majority of my stars go towards."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10451914/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," Boom Boom ","Some good action sequences including bots 'n' drones and stuff, the rest is okayish. Like some reviewer quoted Buddha: "expectation is the root cause of sadness", I would conclude, that if you have not much - and even better - no expectations you may kill some spare time but for certain you won't get something worth to remember. Outside the Wire is one of those mass products movie companies - here my theory - produce these days on assembly lines on full autopilot mode. The scripts of course are recycled, oops, written by some algorithms. Also I just wonder, do soldiers really talk all the time and that much?"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10451914/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," Incoherent and emotionally distant plot brings the whole thing down ","It's 2036 and US military has rolled out military robots to enforce their will across the globe, alongside more usual drones and human soldiers. Lt. Thomas Harp (Damson Idris), a drone pilot, gets assigned to assist Captain Leo (Anthony Mackie), a cutting edge android super soldier, for a covert behind the enemy lines type of mission.It's nice to see Anthony Mackie getting a leading role. He is a very good actor with great, understatedly commanding presence. And while Damson Idris isn't quite there yet in comparison he does a credible job acting opposite Mackie.Unfortunately the rest of the film is quite subpar. The film wants to examine what it means to be an android and how much humanity, morals and ethics they can possible possess. But the film actively hinders itself by not focusing on Mackie's character as much as they should. When the final scenes roll in, we have no idea why Leo does the things he does because we quite simply haven't gotten inside his head yet. Or really even started the process of getting in.Aside from that, the superficial plot about terrorists and bombs that serves as a vehicle for this "androids, what are they up to?" thing, doesn't wow us either. It's... there. Not all insurgents are bad, some US officers are needlessly bloodlusty. The usual.The film did have some nice action scenes and the acting could be good from time to time, but suffice to say, this is a film you can easily skip."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10451914/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," Certainly Cannot Say This Was Good ","Strange plot but really not a lot to it. And some poor script writing. Might want to take some Geography classes before you write the next one.4/10."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10451914/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," A well made sci-fi war drama ","In the year 2036, Harp(Damson Idris) is sent on a mission with Leo(Anthony Mackie), but is the mission really what it appears.Great sci fi war drama, never tries to look fancy with it's sci fi look. Damson Idris gives a good performance has Harp, showing that being in war can do to you, and Anthony Mackie is also good in his role too, very intence and likable at the same time. I love the very real look it show during the shoot out scenes."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10451914/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," Outside the Wire ","4/10 - bland sci-fi action feature won't be remembered next month, let alone in the years to come"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10451914/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," A Below Average Action Film ","Another year, another Netflix action film is here to watch, this time it is Outside The Wire and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a drone pilot have to team up with android officer in an attempt to save the world.Main Character Anthony Mackie plays Leo the android who I thought did a good job here and bought quite a bit to the role. He is basically the tough mentor and he does it pretty effectively, his character goes all over the place in the final act and it comes close to ruining it but it doesn't take away from his decent performance. But there is another main character Harp played by Damson Idris and I did not like this character at all. He does something at the beginning of the film that makes him unlikeable from the start and he never recovered for me and I never came around to care about him.Supporting Characters The supporting cast don't offer anything because the film doesn't try to make that happen. The bad guy is as generic and dull as you can imagine and everybody else in the film is barely here and they aren't given anything to really work with. The film only really cares about its too main protagonists and forsakes every other character here.Story The story is serviceable at best, I like the fact that Mackie's character was an android and how this world uses synthetics in general was pretty interesting and could have and should have been explored more. The film just doesn't do a good enough job of exploring it's themes and messages and the final act is so ridiculous and basically feels like it comes out of nowhere in order for the film to try and feel unique. Also the ending feels very abrupt, I don't know why lately it feels like films I watch are ending abruptly and this one is no different not answering all the questions it needs to.Script The script is fine, Mackie spits out some pretty good dialogue and the story does have a few good elements. Though like its story the script falls very short and tries to be more interesting then it is and it could have done with either focusing more on the interesting parts or just be a full on action film.Style The style of the film has some pretty decent action scenes that do show the horror of war. But the film doesn't do enough with what it has, probably because there wasn't the budget that the film really needed for something so ambitious.Overall Overall, this is a below average action film that doesn't do anything to change up the game and really make it stand out and is one you can happily skip."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10451914/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," This is definitely an entertaining action film! No need to critic about the story! A recommended film! ","This film start with a man "Harp" disobey his superior order, and he been reassign to another superior "Leo" scene! As turnout, this film is about Leo need to shut down the US military android project by disguise to take down a criminal warlord "Victor"! Entire film full of quite intense bloody shooting scene, explosion scene, robot been kill scene, martial art fighting scene, and things broken scene! Make the film quite watchable! At the end, Leo kill by the missile launch by US! Harp survive at the very end! That's it! A quite entertaining action film!"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10451914/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","3"," Outside the Wire ","When drone flyer Idris makes a mistake that costs lives he is sent to the front line with super tough soldier Mackie. They go on a mission into the demilitarised zone to battle military robots and assorted bad guys to get hold of nuclear keys that the main baddie Victor Koval is near to getting his hands on.Whilst the 2 leads are fine, this is a remarkably dull actioneer, derivative of The Terminator and I Robot. The robotic angle is not really explored, the action scenes are unremarkable and the climax not really any different to a hundred other action movies. Disappointing."

"," Vanilla militaristic government propaganda with some FX thrown in ","This movie is the usual government propaganda for war and destruction. But hey, they happen to deliver some vaccines. And the usual soft irony: fighting fire with fire has become fighting technological progress and preach Primitivism in a Sci-Fi context."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10457168/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," Complex, fascinating film ","My Fiona (2021) was written and directed by Kelly Walker. Within the first 90 seconds of the film, Fiona stops working with Jane, goes to the roof of their office, and commits suicide. That's an amazing way to begin a movie. However, what keeps the plot interesting is the interaction of the people left behind. Jeanette Maus portrays Jane, who has been Fiona's friend and business partner for years. Corbin Reid portrays Gemma, Fiona's wife (and now widow).Naturally, the two women are devastated. The plot moves forward with Jane and Gemma getting to know each other better, but also--in a way--to spar with each other about who is the more devastated by Fiona's suicide. The movie also includes the women having to battle bias against lesbians and against African-Americans. It's complex, subtle, well acted, and very interesting.We saw this film virtually from ImageOut, the excellent Rochester LGBT Festival. The movie has a solid 7.3 IMDb rating. I thought that it was even better than that, and rated it 9."
