The film starts well ,the sequence of the events seems believable,it doesn't overdo anything,the characters behave rationally in the first half. The landslide begins in the second act ,where audience intelligence are completely butchered by atrocious writing.The main problem with the film that it is aiming for happy crowd pleasing ending. These type of approaches have ruined several films before and 'Bony" adds to the list.The story of the same name was written by Shirshendu Mukhopadhay thirty years ago,kudos to the man for taking such a unique concept to write. If the story wasn't there the film would have been more worse. The story has helped the film to maintain its rationality in the beginning but when the film deviates from it's source it fails miserably. Koel Mallick's performance is very good,her role as a mother has been perfect and that's unarguably the best part of the film. Paramabrata Chattopadhyay's performance is surprisingly half baked,he seems distracted form the role. Kanchan Mallick's comic timings has been used well in the film and his scenes were at least enjoyable. In Bengali films,the casting of pathetic foreign actors has been a habit and in this film that issue is not solved. Their scenes seems so off putting.The action sequences are horrible and the overbearing music during those scenes make those scenes more miserable. In some moments,the visual effects are good considering the budget.60/100."

As dejected and helpless parents of a robotic child Your expressions and acting are just beyond words. Bony adds a new feather to the cap of director Parambrata..this one is your best directed film till date as this kind of cinema is very diffcult to make and You have done that with flying colours.SF and Team Bony deserve a big round of applause for selecting this genre of story for cinema!

","Well this isn't as bad as the reviewers here giving it a '1' rating, but it sure doesn't merit all the 8, 9 and 10's. It's something I've noticed with these low budget flicks, causing me to question whether it's from people who had a hand in the production and filming of them. For such a high rating it would have to be on a par with say, "Unforgiven", "High Noon" or "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid", and that's certainly not the case. The concept here was interesting but the execution was decidedly on the amateurish side, notwithstanding director Travis Mill's rather lengthy rsum of short films and handful of 'B' features. He obviously took his eye off the ball in the scene where Cam Talcutt (Ward Emling) fell asleep reading the newspaper wearing a light colored shirt and suspenders, and woke up with a brown sweater on. He was back in his previous attire in the next scene.The story did have me thinking in a different direction though from the way it wound up. With all those bodies buried in the soft dirt along the river, I thought a good rainstorm would bring back some ghosts to raise havoc with the old codger's mental well-being. Instead, the near finale brought home the meaning of the movie's title, which otherwise would have referred to all the unsavory characters who came through the Cross Trading Company outpost. Not a bad play on words there, but it would have been served much better without that goofy segue initiated by the luckless gal Sadie (Ashleigh Lewis) when she broke the fourth wall to let us in on how she got away."

The horses used were well done as they almost seemed a character of themselves with many good riders.The acting was moderate to good. I wasn't expecting A-list talent on a small budget, but there were a few notable performances. The Trapper and bounty hunter stuck out most with me.The audio could have used a small face lift and sometimes, I felt, although, the music was great, sometimes a bit loud. There was one spot during a night scene with the Sailor and main actor where the lip reading and audio or ADR didn't match up.Breaking the 4th wall towards the end kind of took me out of trance with the story. Figured that be something used in a comedy, but not a dark thriller type.All in all it was a great film. Great usage of limited location and budget. Definitely worth a watch."

I contacted the Director shortly after watching it to tell him how quickly I got sucked into the movie. The music during the opening credits and early part of the film was a harbinger of doom, but what exactly? This kept me guessing as to what it could possibly be with a leading character who is so easy to empathize with. I felt so sorry for Cam and his difficult life as I'm sure many other viewers did. The music keeps telling us something is going to happen and the plot twists give us clues, but it isn't until just before the mid-point where the movie takes off and we realize we are on a train ride we can't get off off.The movie will hold your excitement until the very end. Well worth watching. I'd watch it a second time to enjoy the subtleties in the action.I enjoy these types of movies because they are very believable. This is something that could actually happen, not a fantastical story. There are psychological and thrilling elements without being over dramatic, frightening, or gory. The sets are basic which feels very appropriate to the era.The characters have a sense of innocence which works very well for this type of film, where a good character goes bad. Another reviewer wrote that they weren't expecting A-list talent on a lower budget film. I don't think that would even work for something like this. We need innocent, realistic people that we can empathize with.***SPOILER ALERT******DO NOT GO BEYOND THIS POINT IF YOU DON'T WANT TO SEE ANY SPOILERS*** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** The opening music had me convinced that a dead body was just around the corner. After the first death, albeit in a freak accident, I thought ok, I'm on the right track, but the music kept suggesting that more was to come. When Cam finally snapped I thought oh wow, this is so bad but so awesome at the same time! from there I was completely hooked. I didn't care whether the acting was A-list or B-list or whatever because everyone did a good job portraying their specific character and the outcome although a surprise every step of the way, it was still totally believable."

The story takes one step at a time as the viewer becomes witness to Cam's downward struggling spiral into becoming a savage immoral survivalist. The film is technically perfect, as good as anything that comes out of Hollywood. The dismal, sloppy, rainy setting gives the movie a morose feel that adds to Cam's mounting desperation.

It drew you into the film as you placed yourself into the shoes of Cam Talcutt ( leading character) and others throughout the film. The dark realism of life in those days, the people you encountered, and the western outfits of the times- are given special attention. The lighting, camera work, are as real as you can get.

Reviews.The premise of the story was certainly original and very interesting, and considering this is newb writer and producer Todd M. Friedman's first dabble in the industry, he did ok. It'd been better had a seasoned filmmaker tweaked the screenplay, especially the convoluted and rushed ending.Director Marianna Palka did a fairly decent job for a newb, but many scenes felt too long/unnecessary and needed editing, and the cinematography could've been much better. The score and soundtrack were actually very good, especially for a B-grade film.I felt the leads performed well, and were convincing in their roles, except for Jacques Colimon, who didn't look or play the part convincingly enough.It's a shame this low budget B film missed the mark, a few tweaks here and there would've made this one great.

I think they might have messed up in the editing or something because plot lines will be thrown out there and then nothing happens with them. Or, some things seem to be missing-probably dropped in the editing-that end up making no sense. Anyway, Alex, who lost his wife & son in a car accident, runs a collection agency. Mike is his long time friend/partner/enforcer-or maybe even his brother, I'm not sure. Alex hires Jacques as his new star collector-Jacques just got out of prison for drug dealing so anyone would be lucky to hire him. Alex falls for a stripper, Shakira, who has a son by a drug lord that is in prison. I think Alex wants to replace his wife and son with Shakira and her son. Mike & Jacques try to collect money from the drug lord-in prison-by trying to scare Shakira into getting the money from her husband. When Shakira gets the money, it ends up being fake-was her husband tricking her? Did the guy delivering the money switch it? No mention is made after the fake money is discovered. There is a car chase at the end-I guess they thought it would liven up this turd-and people are killed in a wreck. But, someone-don't worry, I won't spoil it here-walks away with a big check and I have no idea where it came from or who is paying them. Like I said, a jumbled mess.It didn't have a rating but it did have language and sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 27 minutes.I wouldn't buy this on DVD or rent it, either.

Mine vaganti) came out in 2010 and has an IMDb rating of 7.2, considerably higher than this film, which rates 5.7. Maybe because of how things have changed, especially humankind's understanding of LGBT issues and gender versus sex, etc. In this case, if you open your mind a bit, and consider the possibilities that one or more of the characters are not gay, but pansexual (I did not say for sure they is/are, just asked you to consider the possibilities), even if he or they, themselves are not aware. Then the circumstances might make more sense. In an ideal world, would it not be great if we fell in love with people, and not sexes? I am gay, so don't think I am trying to talk anyone into anything, gay, straight, pan, or whatever. I did not decide to be gay, and straight people do not decide to be straight, but what about pansexual people, what do they decide or not decide? I think that is the basis of this movie, and the original Italian film it is based on. How about you? I'll let you be the judge, but in the meantime, if we can look at this and the film it is based on with the romantic comedy lens, maybe it is something we can laugh along with?"

There's still comedy in this indie film, but it definitely deals with real emotions and drama. As a fan of dogs myself -- though I can't say I want to marry one -- I appreciated the film's notion that dogs can feel like a soulmate, particularly when one is dealing with tragedy or abandonment by the people around you.

However, just last week I read a story of a man who was married to his female robot, so it's topical. I also completely understand loving and having a personal relationship with our pets, but marrying one? Hmmmmm. Kinda nutty!

","Master (2021) : Brief Review :Master is out an out massy mania made only and only for entertainment, no matter how it comes. Whatever bashing the film has recieved till date is simply unacceptable for two reasons. One, it is not a bad film at all, so just forget that Crap tag and two, who are those movie pandits who even kept high expectations from it? I mean when you see a trailer you realise what kind of movie it is going to be, right? Like when you watch Avengers trailer you know it is going to be a an entertaining film, not a content oriented stuff so of course you can't expect a film like The Dark Knight or Shawshank Redemption from it. Master clearly indicates a pure mass hysteria from trailer and that's what it delivers. An alcoholic professor aka Master is sent to a juvenile school, where he clashes with a gangster who uses the school children for criminal activities. At first even I was expecting a bad film but unexpectedly it started off so good and it kept me going steady with the attention for almost 90 minutes. It was such a pleasing mainstream filmmaking from Lokesh because many scenes in the first half were very high in Cinematic proportions for this genre. Then, somewhere towards the end it dragged and had me thinking that yes it has some flaws but still it's a fair enough deal overall. Such films aren't watched for acting and quality filmmaking so i don't know how fair it is to talk about those things here. Still, Vijay vs Vijay face off is impressive. Master has some terrific action scenes and massy statements that can be enjoyed by mass lovers. Although it has few things unsettled and scattered like Romance, backdrop and political reference, the overall gesture is certainly enjoyable. Don't believe the overhyped hatred, Master is above average and pretty much watchable for its genre.RATING - 5/10*By - #samthebestest"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10579952/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," A tale of two halves, with a more enjoyable first and a mostly generic second! [+54%] ","Two aspects made me sit through the 3-hour long Master. One's the cracking background score by Anirudh and the other's the casually intimidating villain act from none other than Vijay Sethupathi (who plays juvenile-turned-dreaded-gangster Bhavani). The biggest question here, like in most cases when a director (Lokesh Kanagaraj, in this case) who's had a strong, crafty couple of outings decides to direct a star (Thalapathy Vijay) vehicle keeping all of its star-trappings intact, is the proportion of the director's and superstar's stamps. Lokesh (with his admiration for Scorsese and Tarantino) and Vijay (who's ridden the star wave by consistently saving people in his films) seem like a match made in heaven, on paper.Professor J.D is the kind of character we know little about, a change from the overly spoonfed Vijay characters of yesteryears. He's quite good at what he does during the day, but post 6 PM, he's drunk and dozing. Bhavani, on the other hand, gets a meatier build. He channels the wrongdoings done against him as a teenager to concoct a whole saga of crime (and criminals), in the process, ascending gangster ranks. He uses kids at the juvenile home to run his dirty errands, feeding them basic comforts and a whole lotta dope. When these two behemoths clash, it should feel like a battle of the Titans. Whether it does is another question altogether. That's the kind of film Master is. There's so much that works on paper, but not quite on screen.Master is a suave-looking film, with fabulous colour grading and overall visual style. Plus, we also get Anirudh's best work in a couple of years (since Kolamaavu Kokila), with the background score SO DARN integral to making several otherwise-generic shots play out better. The songs too, are wonderful. Lokesh places some of the songs (like 'Kutti Story') at appropriate junctures, while some (like 'Antha Kanna Paathaakaa') are just sort of there. Now, we all know Lokesh for his staging of set-pieces. In Master, however, it's a mixed bag. There's a set-piece breaking out literally every 15-20 minutes, be it concise or extensive, making you think that brawling it out is all that the film offers as a solution to most problems. Some of it is crafted sufficiently well, though I wouldn't say they have the same recall value of what I witnessed in Kaithi.And we're talking abuse against children here, once the film shifts from its jolly college setting to a shady juvenile home. To extract an extra dose of sympathy, Lokesh resorts to some imagery that further stigmatizes juvenile homes and how they operate. That all of this goes down in the film's second half (when it fully embraces its Vijay film tropes) doesn't help either. Bhavani's punchy antics are what keep the film mostly afloat, and it makes sense that Sethupathi gets the best lines. There are so many supporting characters that fleetingly appear and disappear without purpose, when the film turns 180 in the latter half. Arjun Das, with his baritone voice, manages to leave a bit of an impact, while the rest, including the film's apparent heroine (Malavika Mohanan), have little to do.I did enjoy the writing in Master in bits & pieces - the heroine-saving scene is nicely subverted. The scene where Bhavani and J.D encounter each other for the first time is also quite fun. By the time the film gets to the climactic showdown, as exciting as it is to watch the two Vijays fight it out, the emotional payoff is minimal. As a result, Master is a film that gives you a fleeting sense of exhilaration, not the satisfaction of a wholesome meal. A couple of good appetizers and a palatable dessert can't make up for a largely insipid main course!"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10579952/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," A typical Vijay action movie. And a sign things are starting to get normal. ","I have never missed any of Vijay's releases in the last few years, and that alone should confirm I'm a big fan. He has arrived this year with a new action entertainer called MASTER, and needless to say, it's his usual stuff, and that's a good thing, because his "usual" stuff in my opinion is really good value for money. You can spend three hours replete with his "mass" hero charisma, hair-raising elevation moments, crazy dance moves and above all, breathtaking action sequences, and won't regret it. Especially when life in the last few months has turned upside down for so many of us.In that case, seeing Vijay playing another action hero role where he fights, dances, delivers at least one intense speech and even makes you cry, is a sign that life is starting to come back to normal. I have to appreciate the makers for going ahead with the theatrical release and then not waiting to release it on OTT because that way, both them and us viewers are satisified. Director Lokesh Kanagaraj doesn't really give you another one-night story as he did in Kaithi, but adds his own touch to the typical Vijay film by toning down subplots, only hinting at romance instead of devoting a whole first half to it and focusing on adrenaline-fueled violent action that doesn't shy from being gory and crunchy, although only as per plot demands.The music here is equally praiseworthy as it keeps elevating the film to sky-high levels from time to time. Be it the emotional or the action-packed moments, Anirudh Ravichander deserves applause for his top-notch compositions. As for the performances, Vijay of course is in his usual mass avatar and lives up to the character. He's indeed one of the reasons to watch this film and his expressions continue to impress here. Vijay Sethupathi is truly menacing as the antagonist, and gets to have an intense screen presence at the same time. Arjun Das performs brilliantly and there are times you will hate his character. Malavika Mohanan's performance and characterization come across as a breathe of fresh air, both in terms of execution and delivery. Andrea Jeremiah surprisingly doesn't have much to do for the most part, but is impressive whenever she's on screen.On the downside, Master's climax (not the ending) is a bit of a letdown. I know that this is a just a popcorn action movie and not some investigative crime thriller that requires you to think, but some of the dialogue in the climax is pretty cliche and disappointing, especially when you've been treated to such a great characterization for the rest of the film. Nevertheless, that's just one flaw. The film was indeed long, but again, props to Kanagaraj for not needlessly stretching the film. It's long only because there's an actual story going on.Overall, MASTER is a full-on treat for action lovers all over the world. You get three hours of nonstop action without holding back, and a lot more only Vijay fans will better understand. Since it's on Prime now, I'd recommend watching it if you like the genre or any of the leading actors. Trust me, the way Kanagaraj has breathed life and freshness into a typical hero-villain story is a proof that "mass" action movies are here to stay, and perhaps just the need of the hour. If you are new to this kind of fun, give it a try. If you're used to it, you still won't regret spending close to three hours with another Vijay "master"piece."

","Master (Tamil) review :The big ticket Pongal blockbuster which literally kick-started the ailing exhibition business down South (post Covid pandemic) premiered online on Amazon Prime last Friday just two weeks after its theatrical success. Whether in a cinema hall or your own home theatre, Master spearheaded by Thalapathy Vijay and Vijay Sethupathi is an out and out action packed entertainer worth your time and money. No doubt about that!!Yup, there are plenty of cheer-worthy moments here to satisfy both the Vijay's fans. Most importantly, the film's basic theme and screenplay is unique and thoroughly engaging even with its run time of close to three hours.Playing an alcoholic master assigned to reform a juvenile prison, Thalapathy (meaning Leader) Vijay is super cool whether telling a "kutty" story to his rowdy students or arousing their conscience in the penultimate scene. Top class!!Vijay Sethupathi, as the ex- juvenile convict turned gangster Bhavani, is a perfect foil to his namesake co-star and his characterization of a street smart toughie is simply awesome. The guy is totally rocking as a goon who can knock out anyone with just a single punch. In one scene, the film portrays him like a devil with horns - the way it is done will surely bring a smile on your face.The film's highlight includes some superbly executed action sequences specially the climax, Anirudh's aptly tuned score and last but not the least, the style and swag of the two warring Vijays. I loved their first meet and the interesting tyrst with a pen. Haha!!Dont miss Master - theatres or OTT. This one is a hit boss!!Regards, Sumeet Nadkarni."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10579952/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," Not a Vijay film but a VS film ","Either it should've been a Vijay film or Lokesh's film, mixing up both is like mixing beer & hot and if you know how the body reacts when both are mixed, then you already know the output of this film. VS scored well with his usual casual attitude & Anirudh's music was good but nothing else seemed to have worked out. Vijay, Andrea, Shantanu and everybody else were simply wasted out, maybe it because of the overload of the characters and that's why none of those characters made an impact. Finally, this is more like a VS film than Vijay's film, wondering how Vijay let it to happen but it is definitely a welcoming one. Just simply no characterisation at all to Vijay's role was the stupidest idea that the team has done here, the stupidest idea EVER."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10579952/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Vijay vs VJS ","Master's biggest plus point is vijay sethupathi. If bhavani's character was played by a normal actor, he would have been clearly overshadowed by thalapathy vijay. But since its vjs, the character is well written and is shown equally powerful than hero. We can't call him villain instead an antihero. Another plus point is anirudh's music and bgm which stood as the backbone of the film. Thalapathy vijay performed as usual for his fans. Color tone was perfect. But the film is very predictable and lacks logic for example an alcoholic person quits drinking without any proper treatment. On the whole, master is a blasting entertainer mainly due to vjs act as the ruthless gangster which makes it for me a better vijay film after a long time. First half is mainly dominated by vjs but second half is thalapathy show all the way. Those who expected to watch it for director will be disappointed but i kept those expectations away and enjoyed the film throughout."

","This is the movie after Kaththi where Vijay has shown he can acted as a character rather than the conventional 'do-good-save-people action hero'. He has portrayed the nuances of alcoholic Professor even in short montages and dance steps. On the other hand, there were certain parts that looks unnecessary and added purely for entertaining fans. Hence, it looks odd at certain places. Overall, its a terrific entertainer from Lokesh and team!!"

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10579952/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," A decent VIJAY movie ","You know what to expect when you watch a Vijay movie. The only difference from the usual Vijay movies is the space given to Bhavani(Vijay Sethupathi). I didn't have much expectations so the movie was not disappointing. I felt like the script needed so much refinement. First of all, they should stop treating Vijay as a superstar within the movie. He should play the character not Vijay. The choreography in dance numbers were really disappointing. I'm waiting(pun not intended) for a dance number like Ella Pugazhum. Andrea's character is an example of poor writing. They just placed the archery scene for the sake of that chase. It could've been executed better. And Gayathri should've been just another teacher who plays an important role in the plot. Making her fall in love with Vijay was really cringe. Songs were poorly placed. Especially Antha Kanna Pathakka. It interrupted the flow of the movie. I expected better action scenes too. Vijay is one of the best(and few) Indian actor who can easily handle action. It's Vijay Sethupathi's Bhavani who steals the show. He's brilliant and terrifying villain who talks in a polite manner. The way he belittles the protagonist's emotions was really good. It's the long and nearly ridiculous scenes in the climax what kills the mood."

"," Master, Starring Vijay: Flaws And All, Lokesh Kanagaraj Delivers A Classy "Mass" Movie ","Dear Lokesh Kanagaraj,I am a fan. I love your Tarantino-esque approach to cinema, where you take a bit from this film and a bit from that film and make it totally your own. As Godard said: It's not where you take things from - it's where you take them to. In Maanagaram, you took the hyperlink format of narration and gave it a moral centre. You made a film where the anonymity of the characters (they weren't even given names) mirrored the anonymity of a big city. In Kaithi, a film I am less a fan of than most people, you took the Hollywood "genre" thriller (like a Die Hard) and made a video game-like movie that moved from set piece to set piece. And now we have your most challenging work yet, Master. In a sense, it is easier to make a Maanagaram than a Master, because... Read the full review on Film Companion"

It is a 2 hrs 57 mins long drama about a students' Professor and a Lorry Union crime lord. And a bit of morals, here and there. Let me jump to what i liked:1. Some good action sequences. 2. Some lighthearted comedy scenes. Quick ones. 3. Vijay's personality, as usual, reflects in the movie and he did his job well. 4. Vijay Sethupathi's bland acting. Really, sometimes you don't need to sprinkle your charisma and it comes out just fine. This guy was impressive. 5. Kid Undhiyal's acting. His dialogue delivery and comic verbs were amazing.Now, what as per me could have been better or I didn't like:1. Duration. Rather being a 2 hrs 57 mins long, it could have been wrapped within 2 hours something or another 10 minutes. 2. Story. Even if there were good moments, yet i felt neutral to it. I mean, i had already watched tons of such stuff before, and i wasn't surprised at all. 3. Action. Even if good, still a lot. And i don't feel it was really required. 4. Lack in thrill and mystery.Anyways, still a worth effort by creators. I will rate it 7 out of 10."

","The film is the story of JD (Thalapathy Vijay), a drunkard professor who gets transferred to a juvenile home. There he meets kids who are involved in drugs and alcohol by Bhavani (Vijay Sethupathi), a local king-pin. The story then showcases how the two forces collide and who wins the battle between the two.The film has great acting performances, terrific background music, fantastic action sequences. The total feel of the film is of a mass entertainer which is made for the audiences to watch in the theatres.Acting performance by both the Vijay's are the highlights of the film. Thalapathy Vijay plays to the gallery and enjoys his presence on screen. He is simply terrific and enjoyable to watch. Vijay Sethupathi is brilliant as the drug-lord of the area and he makes you love him with his performance. His scenes with Vijay (telephonic and fight sequence) are mind-blowing. Anirudh as the music director is the fantastic and the BACKGROUND MUSIC of the film will take your breathe away.Overall, MASTER is a complete entertainer and a mass-monster, which is enjoyable from the first scene itself. Both the VIJAY'S makes sure that you enjoy the film till the last minute and off course the remarkable performance of both of them."

I mean, it wasn't boring, but it makes no sense when you think about it.The only good thing I can say about this movie is that Vijay Sethupathy's character Bavani was crafted and developed pretty well. And his acting (as always) did fair justice to the character. Everything else was either sub-par or straight up cringe.The final act; especially the last half hour was laughably bad. Because right up to that point, Master while not "good", was at least not boring.

","Pros - I'm glad that this movie wasn't the typical Vijay movie, glad there were no "love songs" for a change, glad Nayanthara wasn't brought in to do the female lead, if this movie had a female lead to begin with. I enjoyed the choice of music and the background score. Some sweeping shots in the movie were good. Vijay's character, for a change, was slightly closer to a real life person so I assume people could have related to him a tad more. Vijay Sethupathi (VS) was his usual self in the movie, same tone, same delivery, same nakkal here and there. But it was refreshing to have a thug villain who wasn't loud for a change. A lot of people said VS carried the film on his shoulders when this was supposed to be a Vijay movie, did we even watch the same movie? I thought this was neither a typical Vijay movie, not a VS show. I'm fine with the balance the movie had. Cons - It was too long. 3 hrs is way too much time for a movie that doesn't have six 5 min songs every now and then. That college part got done in about an hour, and THEN the actual story starts? WTH man! Almost all of the cast from the 1st hour felt only useful enough to give haircuts and clean up the school? Wut? Nayanthara illa, why was Andrea there for 3 scenes? Might as well have had Charu fill those parts. I'd much rather see the fist-fight from this climax than a "solti-solti-adichan" fight, but dude, some parts of that fight were cringe, the kid almost got kidnapped, and now avan thattu la thaalam podran ah!? A death match is going on, and they stop mid-way to for comedic dialogues? Felt like DC trying to be Marvel. You only get a chuckle, a forced one. Overall - Vijay fans would be happy. I am not one, but I didn't feel like I wasted 3 hours. Only...1.5 out of those 3 hours, though. I'm glad I didn't have to spend $30 to watch this in the theater though.

OKAY..Much awaited Master is here.I've had huge expectations since the combo was deadly Vijay Sethupathi - Vijay - Lokesh Kanagaraj all in package.Story revolves around a juvenile correction center controlled by Bhavani and a drunk college lecturer is sent there to save all the inmates from the gangster. Well, the story itself is similar to many Malayalam / Tamil Movies, but all I cared about the director who brought us Kaithi & Maanadu and I had all hopes on himWriting was lame and too much addition of illogical scenes and crafting. Narration was also in bad shape and was not engaging. First half was average and was expecting a mass in the second half but ended up as below average. Comedy scenes were enjoyable and the action scenes were well choreographed and was a treat.Anirudh's music and background score was average and was okay-ish at some parts.Malavika Mohanan looked pretty but don't have enough screen space to perform.Vijay was okay with his performance but I felt his character was like half baked.I was expecting some real bad-ass performance from Arjun Das but he has nothing to do with the movie.

His on-screen chemistry between him and his brother Tom, played by Mike Manning (a talented Emmy-winning actor/producer you'll recognize from Disney's "Cloud 9" and recently "The Call," "Son of the South" and "Days of Our Lives"), looks so raw and real, that you can really relate to what they're going through in the face of tragedy. Dominick Sivilli's cinematography adds the gritty texture and realism that director Jeremiah Kipp goes for, and Barry J. Neely's haunting score adds to the tension between the characters.A passion project for Kipp, which is also a feature-length adaptation of his 2017 short film of the same name, "Slapface" keeps you at the edge of your seat in a way you've never imagined.

","ATTENTION THIS ANALYSIS IS FROM THE MOVIE: THE GIRL WHO KILLED THE PARENTS!Brazilian film where he narrates in the version of Garoto Daniel what happened before Suzane's parents were brutally murdered in her bedroom. The film consists of showing all this context before the act, but the film is very poor in many aspects, from directing to editing, first let's talk about acting, I didn't really like the acting, especially coming from Carla Diaz, who plays Suzanne, at various times it becomes forced and cannot build the tension of the moment, in addition to the direction not helping much in this construction of tension, her acting forces at various times, I even wondered if I was watching a movie or a play made by the sisters of church in which I congregate. The soundtrack doesn't have much to say, it's not very essential in the film since it doesn't contribute much to the scenes, much of the soundtrack is made of heavy rock. Perhaps the biggest factor that this film lacks is the direction and editing, as in fact the narration of a real story can be interesting if applied in a succinct and good way, it didn't need so much screen time for contexts than in thirty minutes of film we can understand, in addition to the fact that the film, as it is a case of homicide, it tries to give an air of psychopathy in its edition full of flash and memories of crazy or depressing moments, but it ends up becoming crude because it cannot create tension and it stays those scenes flashing over and over as if the terror of the characters' minds had passed, sanity slipping away, if the scenes were more direct, unedited, untracked, just the movement and blood splashing along with the screams I can guarantee the tension would be bigger as it would be a raw and cold death without any trace of humanity but thanks to the editing of the film this is broken and the credits go up giving the dear viewer a relief from having put up with an hour and thirty minutes with a slur and weak contexts that make me sleepy. In addition to other factors like not feeling connection between the main couple that makes the movie move, The Girl Who Killed Her Parents becomes a real boring case movie and it frustrates me a little because we know it really happened and it could be a lot better tapped, but in the end that's what we got.

The exact participation is exactly why we have two films. One with her own version, and other with her boyfriend's.This will only appeal to Brazilians, because of how famous the entire affair is. It is not particularly interesting as a crime, for fans of the genre. The film focuses on the events that led to it, not the act per se. Which is a good decision, people want to know how they were able to do such a brutal murder, without remorse.The idea of two films is interesting, and though they are very similar (most scenes shot only once), the films should be seen in sequence (the order doesn't matter). They are short, under 90 minutes each.Acting is surprisingly OK, I believe most people expected an exploitation spectacle. It has a lot more dignity than that. Nothing fantastic, but it will be enough for the millions who are curious to understand what is not understandable. I would have liked to see more of the crime, the lack of images leaves a lukewarm sensation. I dont like brutality at all, but you can only "feel" this whole story within a brutality scenario."

Which is why I think the idea to dramatize a famous crime was a perfectly valid attempt. And some of the details shown are very interesting, The choices made, though, fell flat in an attempt to maybe try a new formula. The choices I refer to are skipping the whole police investigation, not making any attempt to build up suspense and straight up spoiling all the facts to the audience in the first 5 minutes. The two-part movie was made with the only purpose of making a point that the testimonies of two perpetrators are conflicting in a few key points. The result is that the two parts are mostly redundant and feel like you're watching two slightly different cuts of the same movie. The conflicting testimonies aren't a strong enough premise to revolve the whole project around, and could be clearly shown to the audience in maybe 10 minutes in the third act. The events the movies are based on happened almost 20 years ago, but the script just assumes that it's useless to make a compelling narrative because everyone already knows how it ends.

Of course it should be at some level repetitive since is the same story being told by two people, but they could save us some time to skip the same scenes. The dialogs are unnatural, far from feeling reality while watching. I could see all the time the actress playing instead of the character and I wouldn't recommend this waste of movie to anyone.

Saw the same sad attempts at relevance or street smarts in the Millenium trilogy, makes your toenails flip if you have ever seen the real life version of what they are trying to portray, as they lapsed into cartoonish charicatures that lack any believability if you are over 8 years old and sober."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10605812/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," The crime that shocked a country ","A very good movie, the script is great, the cast worked really well, the movie is perfect..."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10605812/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Storyline is not really thrilling ","The actors did a good job, but the storyline is a bit boring at times.Also, I thought they would go through the murder itself and what happened after that, since it is when the psychopathy of Suzanne is more evident, but they didn't explore that much.All in all, not an exciting movie."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10605812/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," A breathtaking thriller ","If you like true story crimes, you should definitely watch both movies of this story. The Von Richthofen case was one of the most shocking crimes in Brasil.Carla Diaz should receive awards for her amazing performance of Suzane. I had chills in some scenes.. I also really enjoyed the soundtrack and directing."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10605812/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," Good movie, but I recommend you to watch some interviews to understand ","At first the acting was looking fake, but doing some research about the real case, and watching some interviews we can see that this was the reality!!! The girl with 22 years old was dressing up like a kid in the court and acting exactly how is expressed in the movie. The only thing that could change is maybe tell a little more about the judgment. Please, it you never heard about the real case search for it, is going to give you shivers."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10612362/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Surprisingly engaging (but overlong) film ","I wasn't sure what to expect here, with little introduction to this title. As it turns out this is a surprisingly ambitious piece of filmmaking that almost chews what it bites off. At two-and-a-half hours it's much longer than it needs to be, but it delivers a carload of interesting ideas (perhaps a few too many), sincere performances by likeable actors and effective moments. Nice filmwork and score.I'm not usually the first reviewer of any particular film, so I want to stress that this is a real review by an independent party - not one of those hopeless first responders who knows somebody involved with the production."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10616760/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," The Shadow of the Cat. ","Since signing up to my first online film festival in 2020,I've had the chance to catch a number of stunning Horror films from Argentina. Looking for a title to double bill with When the Screaming Starts (2021-also reviewed) at FrightFest, I decided to go in search of a shadow from a cat.Note:Review contains some plot details.View on the film:Playing the type of character which has been a staple archetype of his straight to DVD career, Danny Trejo subverts all expectations with a surprisingly subtle performance as bodyguard Sombra, who Trejo has express sensitive romantic feelings to drag queens who view/ treat him like a returning hero, whilst he tries to hold Emma from digging into her family secrets.Wrapped in a protected blanket by her family and their loyal servants, Maite Lanata gives an incredibly enticing performance as Emma, whose youthful innocence is used by Lanata to thread an enticing curiosity as she chips away at the perfect household image to uncover why her family have cut themselves off from the outside world.Presenting a rosy red apple farm where the audience are introduced to Emma's family, co-writer (with Griselda Sanchez and Gustavo Lencina)/ director Jose Maria Cicala unveils a mesmerising feature film debut, which sinks Emma into a descending surreal Horror mood with grotesque Fantasy stylisation, as Cicala uncoils in brimming with colour dissolves and elegant panning shots the faade of the peaceful life Emma has on the farm, which hides the metallic greens and fisheye lens under the skin of her family.Going onto the farm with a welcoming comedic tone, the screenplay by Sanchez, Lencina and Cicala chillingly paint everything as being just that bit too perfect, which the writers open up to horror as Emma goes down the rabbit hole uncovering the reasons why her absent mum is only mentioned in mutterings, and the hard line her dad takes in no modern technology being allowed, as the family farm is covered by a shadow of the cat."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10616984/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Pleasantly surprised ","Kept my attention. That alone should say something.As a mild agoraphobic, I couldn't help but sympathize with the lead role. The Director/writers definitely got me. I really felt for the main characters.Not the best romance I've ever seen, but for a low budget released/filmed during covid, I gotta say "Hats off.""
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10616984/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," Beautiful film. ","You can see the anguish that the lead character is going through and it's portrayed very well. Soundtracks fit the film perfectly. Solid performance by each of the characters."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10616984/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","3"," Not That Interesting ","Perhaps my expectations were a bit high based on the previous reviews..but if one isn't familiar with agoraphobia, it will be a major a snooze fest."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10616984/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," Busting the Myths of Life Coach ","This is a story about life coach, Rachel, who spend her life being afraid of something. I won't give away what she's afraid of because I think it's an important part of what the movie's storyline.As a life coach myself, this film sparks my interest to see what this is all about. This is a film brought up interesting myths about the life of a life coach. So...if you are a coach, you should go watch it. And if you have fear about something but you're helping others overcoming the fear, you should go watch it.Overall, I thought the film was really well written and I love how the director takes the viewer on a journey to see through the lens of Rachel while given the story a hidden meaning to what life is all about. Definitely a must watch!"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10616984/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," Fantastic Indie Film ","It was emotionally gripping for me partly because I can relate to the main character. I enjoyed everyone's performances and thought the soundtrack was perfect. The main character's condition is portrayed really well in my opinion, and if you are an empathetic person you'll probably have a deeper connection with her performance. If you like slice-of-life movies then I highly recommend watching!"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10619392/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," This should be shared out ","This film is so underrated - Realm of Shadows is a nice dark feature with awesome characters. I hope there's a sequel to this."
