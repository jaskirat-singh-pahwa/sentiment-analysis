"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11591306/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," A half-baked thriller with shades of horror plus lots of clichs! [+44%] ","The writers Shyam Menon and Deepu Pradeep devote an entire murder mystery subplot that takes up a chunk of the film's first half to put two simple plot points across. The first is that Fr. Carmen Benedict (the character Mammootty plays in the film) is a parapsychologist, and the second is that the bigger threat here is Ameya (Baby Monica), an 11-year-old orphan (which we sense the moment we see her!). Yet, I'd still say the first half is more interesting than the second. The latter half delves into possession, exorcism, and what-not in a manner that doesn't surprise us one bit. Also, Manju Warrier's role is terribly underwritten. It's difficult to categorize this film by genre, as it desperately tries to amp up the thrill factor but also focuses on predictable horror tropes. I don't think I'll fancy a second watch of The Priest ever, even if there are a couple of redeeming qualities like the watered-down superstar-isms and Baby Monica's creepy performance."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11591306/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","1"," Disappointing ","Actual rating: 4 stars. But after seeing the 10 star reviews by fan boys, I've reduced it to 1star to balance it. The posters and teasers looked promising. The idea of a priest being an investigator had so much potential. For me, Priest was disappointing from the get-go. Saniya Iyyappan's character came out of nowhere and Mammootty's reaction was so unrealistic. I'm sorry Saniya, but your dialogue delivery is so artificial. Narration scenes demands so much talent. For eg, the scene in AK where Anil narrates the story of "Mundoor Madan", and the scene from Lelam where Siddique narrates his past. The makeup on Mammootty's face was really visible. They used something to make his cheeks look pink. I don't know why.The director deserves an applause for his making style. He did good for a debut. But the writing was so poor. The dialogues never had any conclusion. And they used background music as much as they could. Sorry to say, but adding background music can't make up for the poor writing. Mammootty and the little girl tries to carry the movie on their shoulders. But they couldn't save it either. Manju Warrier doesn't have much screen time. Nikhila Vimal's performance seemed artificial to me. So did her boyfriend's.And I'm not sure if it was some problem with the theater, the sounds were too loud. The story of the first half is similar to one episode in Dexter, the series. The second half was the same old ghost story. Except they tried something which was shown in hollywood flicks like Conjuring. And there was a scene inspired from Doctor Strange. But that was well executed.Dear horror film makers, a dark house and jump scares aren't enough to make a good horror movie. Try and come up with some new ideas. Director Jofin, you have talent. But you should work on your writing skills. Especially dialogues."

And why is that priest acting like he's in a western? Why does most of these things happen?To put it bluntly, this is a bad movie with a story that has massive logical problems that goes on way too long. 2.5 hours of this is just way too much - just cut all the songs and other unrelevant stuff (like the whole beginning)."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11591306/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," A well narrated horror film with a lot of shortcomings. ",""The Priest" starts as a normal crime film with circumstances which we have seen in many films in varying languages. It also has similarity to a certain incident in Kerala ( death of several family members written off as suicide/ accident) that was solved last year. Yet, the film with decent screenplay and poor dialogues with mediocre acting managed to keep everything a bit engaged thanks to the director. Mammootty, the direction, cinematography and bgm were the only good points with many doubts remaining in viewers minds. Why is a priest interested in random crime files.? Who is the girl asking his help. ? All doubts get cleared with the interval block were it is revealed that this, indeed is a horror movie. Movie has similarity to a recent tamil film "Andhagaaram" where spirits of the dead seek the help of protagonist. Post interval, the plot becomes a bit more interesting with inclusion of a case of possession. The protagonist, as usual, warns everyone and as per standard screenplay protocols, he gets ignored until they are in danger. Once they understand involvement of a supernatural entity, our hero regains his authority to conduct 'exorcism' which surprisingly is different, yet makes no sense. Finding out the spirit involved was a bit thrilling where we expect a planned murder yet, nothing of that sort. The spirit had just a misunderstanding regarding her death. Very disappointing. A tail end is involved which was confusing. How did she knw they planned her death while she was in ICU with GCS "6" ( told in the film while she gets treated ), which was moderate brain damage, not coma or death where spirit can wander off. Shortcomings- 1. A patient in a trolley will be carried foot end first, head end first is for dead patients. A common mistake in films. 2. A dying patient gets CPR, epinephrine doses. Once pulse develops and arrythmic, defibrillator is used. Direct use of defibrillator in a pulseless patient is waste of electricity. Another common mistake. 3. Defibrillator is used on skin, not over clothes 4. A patient of GCS 6 will be intubated. Oxygen masks are not used. 5. A patient who is about to go for shock, will get IV fluids with saline bolus immediately with dopamine/ epinephrine as required. Doctors are too chill for a patient who is "about to go to shock" 6. Infants are not born soulless and waiting for a soul to possess during birth. First heartbeat hahappenat around 8 weeks of gestation, meaning the baby is alive since 2nd month for sure. Another common movie mistake since old Hindi films, OM shanti Om was atleast fun. 7. A kid with abnormal behavior will be sent for psychiatric evaluation, not treated as trash can by all teachers including a priest who runs the school. 8. A kid involved/ witnessed a murder/ suicide gets proper psychiatric evaluation and counselling from government to avoid PTSD/Phobias/ Depression , not allowed to roam freely without any individual monitoring. 9. A police official and exorcist working together has become a cliche ever since conjuring. Ezra introduced it to malayalam. And now this film. 10. All actors pre interval gives a lazy dialogue delivery which feels very forced and artificial. Not all films are "Big B 2007" genre.. Another mistake in malayalam films since last 5 6 years. Sachi was a solution but alas he's no more....Better casting would've improved the quality of film by miles.With all the shortcomings, this would've gone to ashes, but the production quality, the director, Mammootty and to an extent Nikhila, held the film together to make it a decently engaging crime horror. Overall a brilliant film from a debutant director. Better job than many experienced ones in the industry. A little bit research and better dialogues would've made this a masterpiece."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11591306/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," Even The Priest could not oust the bad elements of the flick by performing an exorcism! ","Dearth of The Priest (*spoilers alert*).The Priest definitely has its moments, moments of some fine camera work and credible scare (though appearing to derive heavily from popular Hollywood horror flicks). I could also stick my neck out and say that the twist at the end of first half was laudable, which managed to answer a great deal about what I thought were plot inconsistencies, up until that point.But, it falls short at a large number of places. The selection of dialogues and their delivery seemed very juvenile and something that cannot be related to in real life. It can be argued that proper care was not taken while preparing the script. Else, for one, when a DYSP calls you, why would you not enquire what the issue is, prior to deciding to have a meeting only on the next day. Such instances galore in the flick.In terms of the plotline, the backstory of the priest could have been highlighted a bit more, as to why he is so valued by the Police and how he went onto become a renowned parapsychologist. The fact that Ameya waited all these years to track Jessy or to extract revenge on Siddharth is also something one could mull over.Thoroughly cliched and appearing to derive heavily from popular Hollywood horror flicks and Malayalam revenge dramas, the script and a few performances too come across as lame and close in on being distasteful.Though it has its moments of scare and some admirable camera work, even The Priest would have found it difficult to perform an exorcism on the flick to oust its bad elements."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11591306/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," A so and so film ","The theme is comparatively new in Malayalam movie industry. But the script/story was not quite strong.So many scary scenes were added just for the sake of it, which in turns makes them not so impactful after all. The script, to an extend, moves in a predictable manner. Funnily, one of the subplots felt better than the main plot. They should've made that subplot the main one.Performance wise, everyone did a good job, but no one stands out.Background music was ok. Some songs were not needed.All in all, this is just a passable movie."

The starting was a bit flat, especially cos of the role done by the police officer (Sivadas Kannur), who was atrocious. Also felt that his and Saniya's dubbing or pronunciation was terrible in parts. The story picks up steam though once the junior artiste's story takes precedence and daresay the middle parts were pretty good and intriguing. I was getting feels of the English movie Orphan at times, but the director wasn't that adventurous and went for a bland ending. Yea, and so the promising middle section is completely destroyed with a cliche and bland ending. Manju Warrier has nothing to do than play a totally undercooked character. And the director resorts to Deus ex machina techniques a lot towards the end to move the story forward and finish the movie (which was pathetic). It is definitely an okay movie, but the wait for a good paranormal thirller in malayalam continues."

Director Chacko managed to bring that perfection in every moment of the first film. Two screenwriters Deepu Pradeep and Shyam Menon deserve a round of applause for handling the thrilling script well.Halfway through the first half the audience was thrilled to move forward with a small case investigation. Then the movie moves on to the real story and gives the audience a great break. The movie ends with a good climax, (The tail end too) A full applause for the classic performance of both Mammootty and Manju Warrier.Awesome BGM that did all the sound experiments to be seen in the theater itself.In general, Malayalam Horror movies means fireball, Fire and smoke from the eyes, White sari, Dive and Black cat. But None of these clich can be found even by looking with ink. And this movie totally omitted with unwanted the graphics and VFX effects.Although I am not new to exorcism scenes, I can say that there are no such scenes in Malayalam cinema.

","Story by: Scott Hamm Written by: Scott Hamm Directed by: Scott Hamm Produced by: Scott Hamm Acted in by: Scott Hamm ....and yes...reviewed by: Scott HammHere's a definition of the word Ham: "An actor who is overly theatrical - in other words, 'overacts' - is usually referred to as 'ham'. ... The word is frequently used in everyday contexts to refer to someone who likes to draw attention to himself by being overly dramatic."Now the movie review: (by someone not involved in any way to the movie, other than watching it)I love independent films when they're done right. The acting in this is sub par. The difference between a good actor, and a bad one is that a good actor will never let you know there is a camera in the room. A bad actor struggles to keep from looking at it, and it shows in this film.Kipp Tribble was great, as was Nija Okoro.Atmosphere is flat here. It relies too much on the dialogue, like soap operas do.The plot is nothing new, but I can't fault the writers for that. There are only so many times you can place a group of people in a isolated area, and make it unique. This is situation is not unique.The story line is right out of a soap opera. It's listed as a thriller, but it's more of a drama. Where are the thrills? If you stop, and make a sandwich while the movie is playing, you won't miss anything crucial. Short Cuts by Robert Altman is 3 hours long, and I pressed the pause button for bathroom breaks, and refreshment refills. That is drama.The camera work was spot on. Too bad there wasn't anything special happening in front of it, and that pretty much sums up the entire film. If you don't watch, you won't be missing anything. If you do.....hey, write a review.

The movie is a bit hard to watch because of this, especially because the Portuguese is already quite intense to listen to. However, the main characters put a lot of energy in and especially the girl playing Barbara is very charming.

I empathised strongly with the protagonist's situation: his grief, his inability to communicate it, his feelings of isolation and hopelessness, and also how the slightest hint of positive attention from someone new, unlike anyone else in your world, can change your whole perspective.

It's a trap and everyone knows it.I've never read the book. I have seen the David Lynch version and the Sci Fi movies. I do miss some of the Lynchian weirdness. This version feels more Earth-bound without the weirdness. Arrakis has a lot more middle eastern influences. House Atreides is more Scottish. I do wish that they get rid of the damn bagpipes. One hopes that they would get rid of that noise in a few thousand years. As for Chalamet, he is the perfect prettiness for the role. He looks too pretty to be believed as a fighter which is exactly what every other character comments on about him. He has the ethereal look of an angelic hero in an ancient classical Greek story. I'm not sure if newbies could get lost in this labyrinthian world. It's not really that complicated. I think Villeneuve has made the right movie.

I'm not much for narration (show me, don't tell me), but it may not have been a bad idea. The scenes are magnificent with special effects off the chart. Many desert travel scenes are quite endless. How do you spruce up a desert. I thought the sand worms were a little one dimensional. I know there is another film down the road."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1160419/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," If this film was a planet, then it could be fine for temporary stay, permanent not really though ",""Dune" is a really new American movie from 2021 that just got released and I saw that people really liked it, so I got curious and decided to check it out myself. It is a pretty long movie at slightly under 2.5 hours and the director is Denis Villeneuve, perhaps one of the most influential filmmakers right now and maybe number one from Canada. He is also one of the writers and the writing staff also includes an Oscar winner. You can check out the names there yourself. I shall instead elaborate a little more on the cast. Villeneuve being in charge resulted in many big names becoming a part of this project. The lead actor here is Timothe Chalamet, definitely a rising star, but I must say I am not the biggest fan of him really. This is a bit of a problem as he is basically in this movie from beginning to end, but luckily, the supporting cast includes more than a handful actors that I like quite a bit. These would be Oscar Isaac, Josh Brolin and Javier Bardem. With Brolin and Bardem, it felt like a bit of a reunion from No Country for Old Men, especially during the one brief scene/moment in which they clash to some extent. And as we are already talking Coen Bros movies, Isaac's Inside Llewyn Davis deserves a mention as well for sure. So you will find a few actors in here who have worked with the maybe most famous filmmaking brothers duo in the past. Brolin is featured heavily in the first half of the film, but then vanishes completely. Isaac also has more screen time early on. Bardem has a brief scene when his character is introduced, but appears in the last 30 minutes again. I personally thought that he would not show up again with this film, but play a central role in the second movie. Yes, there is a sequel indeed. This already becomes clear when this film here starts as we see a "part one" or something and also the way this one ends makes it very obvious that this is not it.As for the rest of the cast, Rebecca Ferguson is almost lead as well, which was okay. Zendaya I am still not buying the hype and she is only really in it near the end. Momoa is on the good side, while Skarsgard and Bautista are on the enemy team. The latter is really making himself a career now if you take a look at everything he has been in, even if it is always supporting parts. His recognition value probably helps as well. Oh yeah, Charlotte Rampling also has a memorable scene in here. I will get to that/her later. Of course, people will immediately think of the David Lynch Dune movie from decades earlier. I will not talk about parallels or differences now with that one because I have not seen it. Let's just focus on this one here instead from a standalone perspective. There is enough to elaborate on anyway. I must still say that I struggle with seeing Chalamet as some kind of hero or chosen character. I don' think he has the props to really pull it off. Of course, this is the idea that he does not look like Hulk or Thor or something, but when I see him show his dedication like how he really wants to join Momoa's character or how he can defeat Brolin's character in a duel or how he leads his mother in the desert and knows exactly how his items and uniform work because he is such a natural or how he in the end says his path leads through the desert, it is difficult to believe. Also how he of course wins the battle against this fella near the end who challenges him. And he has to kill in the process, which also shows us how much of a kindred spirit he is that he has never killed somebody before.Death is a crucial component in here. Still I must say seeing how literally every single good guy, be it Isaac's character, be it Momoa's, be it the seer, goes out in a heroic manner that puts harm to the enemy side was a bit much and eventually also repetitive. There were other issues I struggled with here in terms of the plot. Take a look at the idea of Chalamet's character playing a real hero. Basically he is the future. And yet, his own folk (Rampling's character) were ready to kill him immediately with this poisonous needle if he pulls out his hand from this box that caused so much pain to him. Or his dreams and premonitions linked to Zendaya's character were also not exactly new or inspired the way they were put on display here. I could go on by saying that for example the introduction did feel too long and this movie could have been (or should have been) half an hour shorter perhaps. What I cannot say anything negative about is really the way in which the bad guys attack. When they come for Isaac's character and the others, it is really spectacular and this is when this film is at its very best and an incredibly tense thrill ride. In the middle of the film. Unfortunately, when this is over and the bad guys have won for the moment, it gets a bit weaker again and here and there it drags a bit and has some lengths. What also can be said is that this film is never really intended for comedic purpose. The way you could see it a lot on another Bautista fantasy/sci-fi movie. There was this one moment when Momoa's character talks about Chalamet's character's muscles that was a bit on the playful comedic site and maybe one or two other inclusions as the film went on, but yeah this is not a movie to pick for light relief or something. It takes itself very seriously. Does it have the right to? I am not sure.Of course, there is absolutely nothing wrong with sets, cinematography, costumes and all other visual/audible production fields, but this is pretty much a given now with a film of this dimension, even if we maybe should not see it as a given. With the likes of Zimmer, Roberts and West in charge, however, there is at least as much competence available in "minor" departments as there is in front of the camera. If not more. But back to the action itself: With the spectacular visuals, this is definitely a movie you'd rather want to check out at a theater than at home on a small screen. Unless you have a home theater of course. Oh yeah, another moment that will maybe make you smile is how Isaac's character tries to get Brolin's grumpy character to smile really early on. The latter reminds me a bit of the man Brolin played on Sicario. Anyway, I guess we will see more from Brolin's character in the sequel here as well. As for Villeneuve, I must say I liked his earlier stuff like Prisoners, but his recent take on Blade Runner did almost nothing for me unfortunately. Quality-wise, this movie here is somewhere in-between. It's not a revelation or anything and I think the reception is way too positive (I even saw people consider Chalamet for an Oscar nomination, like come on!), but it is worth seeing if you like the genre and some of the cast members I suppose. Not a must-see by any definition though. Seems as if Villeneuve really enjoys giving us his take on some films that are considered classics. It certainly could have turned out worse here, but I hope that with whatever he does in the future, also after this sequel here, he can manage to be a bit more essential again. The pathos felt a bit much at times and did not always ring true. This maybe also could have had to do with Chalamet for me though. If you like him more, you will maybe not see it.The attention to detail at times was still pretty good. I liked Brolin's words during the training sequence linked to Chalamet's character expressing he is not in the mood for fighting or so and how he has to fight when the time is right and how this felt connected to his battle with one character near the end. Completely aside from that, I initially struggled with the sand component, but in the second half they turned the background and location into something special and you could feel the endless desert element finally. Also the idea of these sandworms was depicted nicely. Or how a ring is used to print a seal or signature. Or these helicopters that look like insects. Or the little drone, so it is not just the big spectacular inclusions where you can see all the talent that was included in the making of this film. Unfortunately, there were also many struggles. I mentioned most of them, but while I already stated that the introduction felt too long, the real introduction at the very start felt incredibly rushed and it was impossible to remember all they mentioned there. Pretty much a no-go for a film with this running time. All in all, I still give it a thumbs-up and I think the good is more frequent than the weak, but there's no way I would say that this is among the very best films of the year 2021 so far. Maybe the better, but not the best and I hope that Villeneuve can step things up with the second film, but given the lead actor I kinda doubt it. Anyway, if you like this one, you can probably keep watching. Maybe said sequel is out already once you read this review of mine and then you can decide for yourself anyway. (tt1160419)"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1160419/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," The Desert takes the weak ","The Duke (Oscar Isaac) is sent by the empire to take control of the spice operations on Arrakis, which sounds like Iraqis.

The Duke's son Paul (Timothe Chalamet) is the main character and has too much of his mother (Rebecca Ferguson) in him. She comes from a long line of witches and he has some of their powers such as "The Voice" and "The Sight" which is similar to "The Force." He dreams of a girl (who doesn't?) and of things to come. As it turns out, the empire was quite honest with them.I have never read the book. Three of us watched the first one on VHS and fell asleep during the film.

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1160419/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," "He shall know your ways as though born to them." ","It's been some time since I've read the Frank Herbert novel, and I had already forgotten much of the story. However it wasn't a problem picking things up as characters and situations presented themselves in this film, so I'd have to say that was a plus for this viewer. The scope of this picture is quite outstanding, spanning as it does a complex and fragmented universe of worlds and kingdoms. Central to the story is the valued importance placed on a spice that's a preferred hallucinogenic for some, and for the elite, an important component required for interstellar travel. In the novel I believe it was something as common as cinnamon, but on the planet Arrakis, required an intensive mining operation to reclaim it from the barren desert soil in which it's found.The entire story is veiled with a mystical sort of ambiance in which the protagonist, Paul Atreides (Timothe Chalamet), learns of his destiny while obliquely being referred to as 'The One' of legend, a person who will come into great power. Quite honestly, the setting, costuming, characterizations and palace intrigue is all quite reminiscent of 'Star Wars', even if the original novel was written over a decade before George Lucas arrived on the scene. Even the hostile environment of Arrakis has the feel of Tatooine, with the appearance of the Shai-Hulud recalling the Sarlacc, one of Jabba the Hutt's favorite pets.What surprised me with this first installment of the Dune saga was how well director Denis Villeneuve managed to condense the epic scope of a massive novel onto film, even if half of the story is yet to be told. The movie incorporates the most critical elements of the novel into a narrative that works really well. Even though I actually did enjoy the 1984 version directed by David Lynch, this one proves to be more inclusive of events in the novel, and I look forward to a successful conclusion to the saga in due time."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1160419/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," destiny will come ","I've never read Frank Herbert's novel or seen any other adaptation of "Dune", so I have to take Denis Villeneuve's adaptation as the guide. It's an impressive movie. Not just the visuals, but in the story's complexity.

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1160419/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Dune ","The 1984 David Lynch movie was a box office flop and has been garnered with mixed to negative reviews over the years, but the trailer for the new movie, based on the cult book by Frank Herbert, looked like it would be much better, directed by Denis Villeneuve (Prisoners, Arrival, Blade Runner 2049). Basically, in the distant future, the year, 10,191, in the known universe, Duke Leto of House Atreides (Oscar Isaac), ruler of the ocean planet Caladan, is assigned by the Padishah Emperor Shaddam Corrino IV to replace House Harkonnen as fief rulers of Arrakis. The planet Arrakis is a barren desert planet populated by gigantic sandworms, better known as Dune. It is the universe's only source of the spice called melange, a drug that extends life and expands consciousness. The Spice is also critical for safe instantaneous interstellar travel to any distance in space. Shaddam intends to have House Harkonnen stage a coup to retake the planet with aid of the Emperor's Sardaukar troops, eradicating House Atreides, who threaten Shaddam's control. Leto is apprehensive but sees the political advantages of controlling the spice planet, and an alliance with its native population, skilled fighters known as the Fremen. Leto's concubine Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) is part of the Bene Gesserit, an exclusively female order with advanced physical and mental abilities. Although Jessica was instructed by the Bene Gesserit to bear a daughter to descend and become the Kwisatz Haderach ("one who can be many places at once"), she instead gave birth to a son, Paul (Timothe Chalamet). Throughout his life, Paul has been trained by Leto's aides, Duncan Idaho (Jason Momoa), Gurney Halleck (Josh Brolin) and the Mentat Thufir Hawat (Stephen McKinley Henderson), while Jessica trains Paul in disciplines of the Bene Gesserit. Paul talks to Jessica and Duncan about troubling visions he has had of the future. Due to these visions, the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam (Charlotte Rampling) visits Caladan and subjects Paul to a deadly test. He is subjected to experience excruciating pain to his hand, to assess his impulse control, which he passes. Later, Mohiam instructs House patriarch Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgrd) to not kill Paul and Jessica during his coup. He agrees not to harm them but intends to cause their deaths indirectly to end their bloodline. House Atreides arrives at Arrakeen, capital city and fortress stronghold on Arrakis, where Duncan and an advance party have been learning about the world and the Fremen. Leto negotiates with the Fremen's chieftain Stilgar (Javier Bardem) and meets planetologist and imperial judge Dr. Liet-Kynes (Sharon Duncan-Brewster). Kynes explains the dangers of spice harvesting to Leto, Paul, and Halleck, including the giant sandworms. During a flight, they spot a sandworm approaching an active spice harvester with a stranded crew. Leto and his team rescue the workers moments before the sandworm swallows it. Paul's exposure to spice-laden air triggers intense premonitions. Following an attempt by a Harkonnen agent to kill Paul, Leto's soldiers are put on high alert. Suk doctor Wellington Yueh (Chang Chen) disables Arrakeen's critical protective shields, allowing Harkonnen and Sardaukar troops to overwhelm the Atreides forces. Yueh incapacitates Leto and tells him he made a deal with the Baron to deliver him in exchange for freeing his captive wife. Yueh poisons Leto with a gas capsule and is killed after delivering the Duke. Leto releases the poison gas, killing himself and members of the Baron's court, but the Baron survives. Duncan escapes and steals an ornithopter (an aircraft with rapidly flapping wings). Harkonnens capture Paul and Jessica and intend to drop them in the desert to perish. Paul and Jessica overpower and kill their captors using a Bene Gesserit power called "The Voice" to control others verbally. Finding a survival kit left for them by Yueh, Paul and Jessica spend the night in a tent. Paul experiences visions of a "holy war" spreading across the universe and him leading it. The Baron hands over command of Arrakis to his brutish nephew Rabban aka "Beast" (Dave Bautista) and orders him to sell spice reserves and restart production to recover the cost of the coup. Paul and Jessica are found by Duncan and Kynes and head to an old research station but are soon tracked down by Sardaukar. Jessica, Paul and Kynes are allowed to escape the facility when Duncan and various Fremen sacrifice themselves. Kynes, ambushed by Sardaukar troops, lures a sandworm that devours them along with her. Paul and Jessica reach the deep desert and meet the Fremen, among them are Stilgar and young warrior Chani (Zendaya), who Paul has seen in his visions. Their admission into the tribe is protested by Fremen warrior Jamis (Babs Olusanmokun), so they have a ritual duel to the death, and Paul is victorious. Against Jessica's wishes, Paul states they will remain on Arrakis with the Fremen to reclaim the planet. Also starring David Dastmalchian as Piter de Vries, Benjamin Clmentine as Herald of the Change, Golda Rosheuvel as Shadout Mapes, and Roger Yuan as Lieutenant Lanville. I'm not going to pretend I understood everything going on, with all the stuff involving religion and politics, just the main plot that everyone wants the spice. Chalamet makes for a good young hero, Skarsgrd is good at being the nasty and grotesque villain, and the all-star cast, including Isaac, Brolin, Rampling, Zendaya, and Bardem all get their moments as well. The visuals and special effects are fantastic, from the spaceships and alien creatures to the interior and exterior locations and large-scale battle scenes, so it doesn't matter if you don't understand it all, it is a great spectacle, and hopefully the second part will be as exciting, a worthwhile epic science-fiction adventure. Very good!"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1160419/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Visually impressive, but rather unnecessary remake... ","Sure, I was looking forward to getting to watch director Denis Villeneuve's take on Frank Herbert's iconic story "Dune". And yeah, I did also enjoy the 1984 version of the tale, so of course this 2021 version was something that had to be watched.And yes, I did enjoy the 2021 rendering of "Dune", of course I did. I mean, how could I not? Despite of running for a bit more than two and a half hours, the movie was entertaining and enjoyable. And this was just the first part of the story, so we are in for more.Visually then "Dune" was just spectacular, having pretty amazing special effects that brought the world of Arrakis to life on the screen. And if you enjoy CGI effects and great special effects, then "Dune" doesn't disappoint.In terms of casted performers, then the majority of the cast were actually nicely cast for the various roles and characters. Now, I am not familiar with Timothe Chalamet (playing Paul Atreides), but he was no Kyle MacLachlan (playing the same character in the 1984 movie). This 2021 version of "Dune" also have the likes of Rebecca Ferguson, Oscar Isaac, Jason Momoa, Josh Brolin and Stellan Skarsgrd on the cast list. I was really impressed with Stellan Skarsgrd in the movie.And while "Dune" is watchable and entertaining, I must admit that I was left with a sense of 'was this really a necessary remake?' once the movie ended. And then my thoughts went on to "will it be remade again in 40 years, with whatever technology is available then?'. So there was that whole whether this remake was a necessary thing or not looming over it.And I also feel that the character gallery was a bit underdeveloped, as I felt most of the characters were only given superficial characteristics and personalities, never letting the audience really get to know the characters backgrounds, motivations and such. It just felt a bit too shallow in terms of character development and growth.If you have the chance to watch "Dune", then do so. By all means do so, because it is an entertaining movie.My rating of "Dune" lands on a six out of ten stars, like the 1984 movie. Sure, this 2021 movie was more pleasing to look at, but of course almost 40 years have done lots to the development of CGI in the movie business. But the 2021 version is held back by an inferior character gallery and that overwhelming sense of this being essentially just a massive waste of money and effort in terms of remaking something that didn't really need to be remade."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1160419/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Classic and sophisticated sci-fi at it's best. ","Fans of "Lawrence of Arabia" (1962) might recognise the bleak scenery around Wadi Rum, one of many stunningly beautiful and evocative locations used is this epic piece of cinema. It is that photography, and another hugely complimentary score from Hans Zimmer, that perfectly sets the template for this adaptation of Frank Herbert's story of family, avarice and power. I was sceptical about it being split into two parts (especially given the lengthy delay between this and the sequel) but it really works well. The unseen Emperor of the Known Universe commands that house "Atreides" take over the mining of the valuable "spice" from their arch enemy the "Harkonnen", and so the Duke (Oscar Isaac), his wife "Jessica" (Rebecca Ferguson) and son "Paul" (Timothe Chalamet) must prepare to relocate to their new and distinctly hostile desert world. It is clear from the outset that young man is troubled. He sleeps fitfully with strange dreams all set upon a planet he has studied but never visited. Upon arrival, they are betrayed and the young man and his mother must find and befriend the local "Fremen" population and learn how to survive and to fight back. Now I won't fib, it does drag a bit at times, and if you already know the story from either the book, or the David Lynch version from 1984, then that can lead to you wanting to shout "get on with it" at the big screen, but being patient with this brings it's own rewards. The attention to the detail, and the grand scale of this feature is immersive, it draws you in and there is enough action, and food-for-thought to sustain that interest for the most part. Chalamet offers us a strong and engaging performance. He is growing as an actor, maturing - and though he still looks like a decent meal would kill him, he owns the picture in a way (for me, anyway) that he never has before. The remaining cast members gel well together, and the mysticism and political manoeuvring that underpins this story is subtle and nuanced but potent in it's presentation. The costumes and visual effects are splendid - I want one of the locust-copters (though heaven only knows what the vibrations must be like onboard!), and we do get a sense - but really only that - of the enormity of the giant worms that patrol the desert looking for their quarry. The second part of the novel was always the more interesting. We will see the characters develop more, and we will learn more of the troubled "Paul" and of whom he really is - as well as there being much more actually going on. If this is the standard of the opening gambit, then what is to come ought to be wonderful."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1160419/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," Villeneuve's Greatest Sci-Fi Film ","Watching director Denis Villeneuve's groundbreaking adaptation of Frank Herbert's classic science fiction novel "Dune" is like feasting on an all-you-can-eat buffet. You can gorge yourself on combatants and conspiracies galore during its spartan 156-minute runtime. Unlike its ill-fated predecessor, David Lynch's critically reviled "Dune" (1984), which shoehorned Herbert's gargantuan magnum opus into a procrustean 136-minute escapade, Villeneuve has the good sense not to pile everything into one film. Instead, this $165 million reboot delivers only half of the chronicle, while we must bide our time until the sequel. Some sci-fi fans may cringe at this prospect, but Warner Brothers refused to bank roll the sequel before "Dune" generated some box office traction. Mind you, sitting for two-hours and thirty-six minutes requires not only purpose but also patience. Meantime, Villeneuve retreads several Lynch scenes, but does it with greater scope and spontaneity. You cannot help but be caught up by the rollercoaster blend of white-knuckled cliffhanger heroics and Byzantine political intrigue. Although classified as science fiction, "Dune" never degenerates into a juvenile "Buck Rogers" space opera. "Star Wars: Rogue One" lenser Greg Fraser depicts these larger-than-life characters against surreal landscapes in sprawling picturesque murals. Surrounding Timothe Chalamet, who toplines as the hero, is a formidable cast consisting of Oscar Isaac, Josh Brolin, Rebecca Ferguson, Jason Momoa, Javier Bardem, Dave Bautista, and Stellan Skarsgard. Overall, "Dune" raises the standards for sci-fi blockbusters. Nevertheless, the filmmakers don't bewilder the audience with narrative overload. Clearly, Villeneuve has surpassed his earlier outing "Blade Runner 2049" (2017), and one can only wish him greater success with this sequel.Imagine a mash-up of "Star Wars" and "Game of Thrones," and you'll have a clue about what ensues. Specifically, "Dune" takes place in the year 10,191. This tour de force saga of clashing empires unfolds on the bleak desert planet of Arrakis. This savage, sun-scorched world is the only source in the universe for a unique mineral called spice. Not only does interstellar space travel hinge on spice, but it also is a psychedelic drug that heightens awareness and lengthens life. The evil Baron Vladimir (Stellan Skarsgrd of "Good Will Hunting") of the House of Harkonnen, who amounts to a smaller version of Jabba the Hutt, has reaped an obscene fortune in spice from Arrakis over the last 80 years. Now, the Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV removes the Baron and replaces him with a rival, Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac of "Ex-Machina") of the mighty House of Atreides, who hails from the ocean planet of Caladan. Accompanied by his consort Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson of "Doctor Sleep") and their teenage son, Paul (Timothe Chalamet of "Lady Bird"), the Duke arrives on Arrakis with his aide, Gurney Halleck (Josh Brolin of "Sicario"), and a vast army. Leto suspects the corrupt Emperor may be setting him up for failure.Pandemonium erupts soon after Leto has taken over the spice mining operation. Earlier, the Duke had vowed to forge an alliance with the natives. Known as the Fremen, this disgruntled nomadic race resides in Arrakis's deep caverns and conducts campaigns like guerrilla warriors against the spice miners. Suffering dreadfully under the Baron, the Fremen expect similar treatment from Leto. The Duke dispatches a scout, Duncan Idaho (Jason Momoa of "Aquaman"), to embed himself among them and win their hearts and minds. Swathed in hooded white cloaks, this mahogany-skinned tribe has dazzling cobalt blue eyes from using spice. A blue-eyed babe haunts Paul's dreams. Meantime, the mining equipment Leto inherited from the Baron is in rough shape. If the broiling temps on the surface weren't bad enough, prodigious sandworms--some as long as 13-hundred feet--cruise beneath the shifting sands like great white sharks. These leviathans can wrap their elastic mouths, bristling with zillions of wicked, razor-sharp fangs, around an entire spice harvesting machine. Eventually, treachery within Leto's palace topples his rule, and the Baron's soldiers annihilate Atreides' army. Miraculously managing to escape, young Paul takes refuge with the Fremen and ponders a rebellion against the Baron.Comparisons between "Dune" and "Star Wars" are inevitable. Indeed, both films share certain formulaic scenes which seem virtually interchangeable. An empire-building yarn with anti-colonial sentiments, "Dune" takes itself far more seriously than "Star Wars." When Paul watches his mentor perish, our hero suffers as tragically as Luke when he witnessed the demise of Obi-wan Kenobi. "Dune" differs, too, because it is a sword and sandal saga about supernatural critters. Arrakis makes Tatooine seem like a beach resort. Villeneuve and "Prometheus" writer Jon Spaihts and "A Star Is Born" scripter Eric Roth don't overwhelm the audience with volumes of exposition that cluttered up the Lynch film. Instead, they parcel out exposition and use it to foreshadow events. The warfare is conducted with ancient as well as futuristic weapons, with emphasis on ancient weapons. The dragonfly helicopters-known as ornithopters-look exciting. The crisp dialogue is both pointed and compelling. Villeneuve and company never cut our underdog heroes any slack in this initial bloodthirsty chapter, and the evil Baron maintains the upper hand despite minor setbacks like a near-death experience. As villains go, the grotesquely fat Baron makes an admirable but unscrupulous adversary. Josh Brolin and Jason Momoa wield their weapons like old hands. Unlike Lynch, Villeneuve doesn't rub our noses in unsavory violence. Nonetheless, the battles are savage without being sadistic. Hans Zimmer's brawling orchestral score with native choral interludes enhances the atmosphere. Altogether, "Dune" qualifies as the first truly great science fiction classic of the 21st century with a coming-of-age hero driven by prophetic dreams he cannot fathom."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1160419/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," At last ","Spice, a substance mined only from the deserts of planet Arrakis, is the most valuable commodity in the galaxies since it enables interstellar transport. The violent and sadistic Harkonnen family have help the spice mining franchise for 40 years, becoming immensely wealthy in the process, alienating Arrakis natives the Fremen in the process. The Emperor abruptly appoints the Atreides family instead, infuriating the Harkonnens who sabotage equipment left behind, and plan a violent takeback. This results in heir apparent Paul Atreides and mother Jessica being abandoned in the desert, where they need to fall in with desert experts the Fremen in order to survive. Trouble is, after 40 years of the Harkonnens, the Fremen aren't very keen on offworlders.And.... end of part one. We are halfway through the story, with a part two which may never be greenlit if box office doesn't justify it which, in this post-covid world sounds somewhat unlikely. So what's part one like?My history of Dune and director Denis Villeneuve meant I was not hopeful. I read the novel in my teens in the 1960s and found it dense and impenetrable. David Lynch's movie had its moments, but got hacked about by the studio. The later TV series was more lucid, but suffered from some really poor casting and acting. And I had problems with Glade Runner 2049 and Arrival, both of which were a bit too cerebral for me, and less clear than I would have liked from a narrative stanndpoint.Dune (part one) 2021 is a fine film. It looks amazing, which one would expect these days. The casting - and acting - is excellent. And the script/adaptation is first rate. The power games which underlie the main plot are clear and obvious, the interplay of character dynamics is solid, subtle story points come through, all the little bits you need to understand are explained organically without huge obvious information dumps, and the story flows easily throughout the two and a half hours.I have two reservations. One, the film isn't as significant as it sometimes seems to think it is. And, two, Hans Zimmer's score is dissonant, intrusive and aggressive and I actively disliked it.But I liked the film very much, and I greatly hope there will be a part two."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1160419/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," Lifeless, Emotionless, and Dull ","At the very end of "Dune," Denis Villeneuve's attempt to make a screen version of the novel that isn't a disaster, a character says, "This is only the beginning." The line is meant to be an enticing promise of what's yet to come. To me it sounded like a threat. I knew this was only the first of a two-part movie, and yet this bit of news still managed to be one of the most demoralizing things I've heard in a long time.The creators of "Dune" clearly love the source material and have attempted to make something true to it with much care and love. But they've somehow still managed to make a lifeless, dramatically inert bungle of it. I didn't feel a single thing during this nearly three-hour movie, except the urge to pee, which I knew would happen given the size of the Modelo I bought at the concession. Seriously, you should have seen this Modelo. I paid $13 dollars for it, which was almost as much as the amount I paid for the movie ticket and parking combined. At first I was astounded, but then I saw the can they were handing to me. It was like I got my own personal keg of beer. This is the first time I've ever had a movie end and realize that I still had beer to drink, which I chugged during the closing credits.Wait...did I wander away from the subject of "Dune?" That's because the story of my beer is more interesting than this movie. Have you ever seen the musical "Urinetown?" If you have, you know that there's a song at the beginning about how the characters don't want to overload the audience with too much exposition right off the bat. The creators of "Dune" should have watched "Urinetown." This movie is nothing but exposition. We have to have someone explaining something to us in every scene. At one point, there's even a five minute scene where one character literally tells the other characters how their suits work. It's like a mechanic explaining to you how a car engine works when you're not that into cars. There's an audience for it, but I'm not it.One brown, ponderous scene follows another, while Hans Zimmer's screeching score drones on and on. At first it was just there, but by the end of the movie the music had me wanting to climb the walls. It becomes a parody of itself. By the time a bunch of female vocalists came on the soundtrack wailing in something resembling a Middle Eastern way, I had decided that this might be one of the worst scores Zimmer has ever composed.The movie never changes tone. I mean never. It never changes pace. I mean never. I suppose during some action scenes the editing literally gets faster, but the scenes still somehow manage to remain lifeless and unexciting. I never felt a sense of adventure, which is odd for a movie about a young man who gets the opportunity to leave his home planet and experience something new. I never cared about anything. None of the actors seem to be having any fun being in this movie. Timothee Chalamet is pretty as a postcard, but he has exactly one facial expression. Oscar Isaac is in this. So is Jason Mamoa. So is Josh Brolin. So is Javier Bardem. Lots of good talent. All of it swamped by colorless production design.This is the kind of movie with rabid fans who will tell you that there's something wrong with you for not liking it. I can just hear them saying things like "Stick to 'The Fast and the Furious' you nincompoops who are too stupid to understand such profound things as 'Dune'," as if they have any idea who I am or what my movie tastes are. Let those people get their knickers in a twist, and let those who also thought this movie was a boring slog join me for a keg-sized Modelo. Cheers!Grade: C-"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1160419/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," stunning visuals ","Greetings again from the darkness. It's been nearly 40 years since David Lynch directed DUNE (1984). The film received an Oscar nomination for Best Sound, and has since been a cult favorite, though not one I'm particularly drawn to. All these years later, Frank Herbert's 1965 novel (there are 5 sequel novels) has been re-made by acclaimed writer-director Denis Villeneuve (ARRIVAL, 2016) and his co-writers Eric Roth (Oscar winner, FORREST GUMP, 1994) and Joe Spaihts (PROMETHEUS, 2012). The new version looks absolutely fantastic, even if the story is a bit convoluted and the characters don't always make the best, or even logical, decisions.The year is 10191, likely the most futuristic movie we've seen. Oscar Isaac is Duke Letto Atreides and Rebecca Ferguson is Lady Jessica Atreides, though the story mostly focuses on the son, Paul, played by Timothy Chalamet. The story revolves around the protection of spice, the most valuable resource in the universe/galaxy. However the real focus is on politics and power plays ... so I guess not much really changes over the next 8170 years - except, of course, the colonization and travel between multiple planets (surprisingly, none of these planets is named Elon or Bezos). There is much talk of "the plan" with emphasis on whether young Paul is "the one" mentioned in their legends. Paul does have some special abilities, but Chalamet's understated (and mostly monotone) portrayal makes everyone, even Lady Jessica, a bit unsure of whether he's the leader they need.The supporting cast is impressive and all do their part to drive the action and story forward. Jason Mamoa is Duncan Idaho, the warrior who humorously belittles Paul's fragile physical frame. Josh Brolin is Gurney Halleck, the bodyguard to the noble family, and Charlotte Rampling plays the Reverend Mother (a creepy nun). Oscar winner Javier Bardem is under-utilized as Stilgar, while Zendaya shines as Chani, one who bonds with Paul. Of course the most outrageous role finds Stellan Skarsgard (with some heavy make-up and special effects) as the grand emperor of Harkonnen, with Dave Bautista as his brother, the Beast.For me, the movie's technical aspects are what stand out. It deserves awards consideration in multiple categories, especially Sound, Visual Effects, Cinematography, and Score. Oscar winner Hans Zimmer really delivers a score that compliments and enhances what we see on screen. Cinematographer Greig Fraser has been involved in numerous high profile projects, like ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY (2016) and the highly anticipated THE BATMAN (coming in 2022). The effects are special and include the sandworms, as well as dragonfly choppers that are quite impressive. It was a bit annoying to see the desert sand blowing constantly, yet goggles and masks are hardly ever used. I guess these faces are too expensive to cover up!Familiarity abounds as some bits recall MAD MAX, EDWARD SCISSORHANDS, STAR WARS, and THE MATRIX. Director Villeneuve shot the film in Norway and Jordan, and to answer the question from fans of the original ... no, Sting does not make a cameo appearance. The film looks stunning and will likely satisfy the target audience. Whether it's enough to expand the audience is something we will know soon enough. The film ends with "This is only the beginning", and Mr. Villeneuve has Dune Part Two in the planning stages.The film will be released October 22, 2021 in theaters, on IMAX, and streaming on HBO Max."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1160419/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," I can't wait for part two, and hope for more parts after that if they're of the same quality as this one. ","I barely remembered anything from the 1984 Dune movie, only that I liked it at that time. But this remake is certainly something else. The progress we made now, technologically speaking, is just from another world. The visuals in Dune: Part One are just stunning with amazing spaceships and other tech. That alone is worth watching this movie. If you're a sci-fi fan you really can't go wrong with this one, it's all very mindblowing. The story itself is also entertaining. I can't wait to watch the second part to be honest. As for the acting, the whole cast did its best, they all gave convincing performances. At first I thought did we really need another remake of a 37 year old movie? Can't they come with something new? But I was wrong, this movie is totally worth watching, just for the visuals alone it's already worth it."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1160419/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," More of a remake of Lynch's film, rather than an adaptation of the book ","I am one of those few people who thought Lynch's 1984 Dune was great. It was terribly edited and had other flaws, but it captured what I feel is the essence of the book. Of course it wasn't exactly like the book, it couldn't have been. Enter Denis's Dune, 2021, everything can be done on a computer, actors have had decades to refine the craft, films are not forced to be one hour and a half anymore, the budgets are astronomical. So how is it? I liked it, but I feel that it was something closer to what someone does after thinking for a long about how they would fix 1984 Dune rather than a reinterpretation of the book or even a very dry rerendering of it like the 2000 miniseries.There are two things I really didn't like. One of them is the flat refusal to do anything that might be considered R-rated. The film is butchered to blandness, even when it features vicious knife fights, large scale warfare and sadistic Harkonnen. Second is Jessica's character, who is portrayed as a weakling, rather than the incredibly resourceful Bene Gesserit who has been trained for years that she is. I love Rebecca Ferguson, but she is not right in this film and nor is her character.The visuals, while impressive, were kind of subdued, too. The mutated Navigators don't even make an appearance, the Harkonnen look big and fearsome, but clean and not really vile, the worms are shown with restraint, the colors are muted, the clothes and overall attire are simple, functional and uninteresting.Bottom line: I am sorry to say that I think Lynch's film would have probably been better if the same resources and artistic freedom would have been awarded to him. This Dune doesn't really show as much an improvement as 37 years of thinking about it should have warranted. And it is tame and lame, refusing to take the artistic risks that should have been taken to portray with today's technology and knowledge a world 8000 years into the future and described with so much care and attention in Herbert's books.Well, back to reading all the books again and dreaming for the next 40 years of an adaptation of God Emperor of Dune..."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1160419/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," Long, Over-Dune ","I'm so obsessed with going completely cold into a movie, I read nothing, watch no trailers/vids, observe anything to do with a movie prior to seeing the movie. In the case of DUNE PART ONE, that plan backfired.Had I known this was only Part ONE of what appears to be a 5+ hour SLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW film, I wouldn't have bothered. Yes, in the opening couple of minutes, it actually does say: DUNE PART ONE. But, I read that as JUSTICE LEAGUE's Part 1 of 6, as in chapters, not actual movies.That all said, this movie deserves 4/10 stars for its incredible cinematography, visuals, special effects and score. Those should absolutely be nominated for Academy Awards. But, the rest, including another convoluted DUNE script, was pretty much crap.The technology they showed in this movie felt more like 8 years into the future vs. The 8,000 they want us to believe. But, on the flipside, the certainly not Tatooine planet had too much of...everything. How on that planet do they have any supplies or creatures or "humans" when there doesn't appear to be a drop of water on the planet's entire surface? If it's underground, how did they drill with no natural materials to build anything on the planet?I was also obsessed with that planet and how anyone could live there. But, that's besides the point. I hate this plot and barely made it through, even turning it off at about 48 minutes, but I was interested just enough to come back to it in about 10 minutes.Again, had I known this was just PART ONE, I definitely wouldn't have returned.***Final Thoughts: Just saw both DUNE films for the first time within the last 2 months and I have to say, if you loved the book or just curious about the film-format, I'd probably recommend this one over the David Lynch one. You can't go wrong with this score and these visuals. I understand the other movie was from the mid-80s, but frankly, I've even seen way better FX long before DUNE (1984) came out."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1160419/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","3"," painfully tedious adaptation of an overrated novel ","I wasn't a big fan of Dune when I read it. It was like a sci-fi/fantasy take on an old sword-and-sandal political intrigue thing, complete with dull characters and dumb story.On the other hand, it had this wonderfully anthropological creation of a desert world and its people. That was the only reason I got through it.Dune Part One is the first part without the second part. The characters are still dull, the plot still dumb, and the sci-fi world-building almost non-existent. The scenery and special effects are quite good, but nothing is interesting; even action scenes are listless.Will Dune Part Two offer the world-building that was the only good part of the book? Doubt it. Anyway, I certainly can't take any more of this."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1160419/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," visual and auditory explosion of beauty ","I want to start by saying the most important thing. If you want to see this movie, WATCH IT IN IMAX. Or at the very least any premium screen (ultrascreen, emax, etc). Definitely don't watch it on HBO max unless you have a full theater system with surround sound. Whoever made the decision to simultaneously release this on VOD is a moron. It benefits from a theater viewing more than any movie since Tenet, maybe longer.The other most important thing to know is, this is half of a movie. It's basically incomplete. The first part of a 5 hour epic. I wish i knew that going in. I started becoming anxious because the story didn't seem to be progressing as fast as i would expect. I finally realized that the "part one" in the opening title was for the entire movie. It feels more like a setup movie than it's own story.The things i liked... there is so much. From a technical perspective, this is an absolute masterpiece. The directing, cinematography and music are all maximum top-notch quality. This isn't surprising, we've seen this from director denis villeneuve (omg arrival). And of course hans is the GOAT movie composer. They are why this movie is epic, to the fullest extent of the word. They are why half the scenes feel like the biggest moment of a normal movie.More on the music, i've been asking for something like this for a while. Where the music is the driving force of the scene, but not just for one or two scenes, but the whole movie. Forget about dialogue during these parts, just marvel at the visual and auditory explosion of beauty.So my dilemma is, how do i score this. I really hope they make a second one (now greenlit!!!), and if it's awesome, i can see myself always rewatching them back to back as a single long movie. But if they don't make one, or if it sucks, i can't see myself coming back to this more than once.I will give it 7 stars (awesome) for now. Depending on the outcomes mentioned above, i could see myself dropping it to a 6 (good) or upping it to an 8 (amazing). (2 viewings, opening night 10/21/2021, 11/3/2021)"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1160419/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," Certain to be a classic, just like the novel, SUPERB! ","Based on the elaborate, spellbinding novel by Frank Herbert, Dune tells the tale of Paul Atreides (Timothee Chalamet) far into the future. Born into a royal family who has ruled the planet Caladan for 26 generations, Paul expects to follow the same path as his noble father, Leto (Oscar Isaac). Paul's Mother Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) is a well known member of the Bene Gesserit, powerful and magical sisters. However, the Universe is ruled by a capricious Emperor who has become jealous of the Atreides. Therefore he allows the Atreides arch enemy the Harkonnens to plot to bring them down. This is disguised as an offer to rule a different planet Arrakis aka Dune. The most valuable element in the galaxies, Melange is only found on Dune. The Natives of Arrakis called the Fremen have been suffering for years under Harkonnen rule. To be sure, the Duke and his trusted staff and fighters guess there will be a trap somewhere. What they don't anticipate is betrayal by one of their own. Pretty soon, Paul and all those he loves are in mortal danger. Yet, Dune has legends about a "chosen one" to lead the Fremen to defeat all their enemies. Is Paul this person? It's very hard to give a decent summary of the story's many layered tale. But Villeneuve the director does a grand job in staying faithful to the book while covering all the major plot elements. The cast is terrific, with Isaac, Ferguson, Josh Brolin, Zendaya, Javier Bardem, Stellan Skarsgrd and so many others. But, Chalamet is especially fine and should get an Oscar nod. Then, the scope and magnitude of the visual effects and fabulous settings are worthy of the highest honors also. Dune is the type of towering spectacle that is rare to behold. Don't wait."

This is a movie that demands to be seen on a big screen, no less. I haven't read a book nor seen previous version of it, therefore all things that i saw story wise were fresh for me. And i won't lie i did felt to be lost here and there, but at the end of the day the storyline was clear.The visual side of this movie was staggering. This is a 100% movie going experience. Special effects looked as real as it gets - if you enjoyed visual side of "Blade Runner 2049" you will get same here - grandiose sets, design, sound and all technical stuff - this movie at every scene looked breathtaking. Yet i wished cinematography was done by Roger Deakins, but still it was solid (but could been even better). Acting was very good by all involved - you can't ask for more from such a cast.Overall, few reasons why i did not gave it 10/10 is because it did felt like a set up of a story more then once - way more then once. Also there are some pacing issues here and there. And finally, this movie will loose ~80% of its visual side when watched at home in my opinion, this is a real movie going experience. But at the end i liked it very much and would like to see Part II - fingers crossed!"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1160419/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," The Movie Falls Short of Lynch's Movie ","Director Denis Villeneuve's attempt to improve on Director David Lynch's 1984 version of Dune fails in a number of respects. First. The pacing of this movie is slow and plodding. Second. The absence of the any Emperor scenes that Lynch so lavishly displayed on the scene offered up a spectacular science fiction motif missing in Villeneuve's version. Third. The absence of the powerful use of spice, a crucial element of the movie in space travel. Fourth. The casting and directing is rather mundane without the sharp and powerful characterization that Lynch cast. The Baron's character is a dull, a toned down shadow of Lynch's version while Duke Leto is a weakened version of Lynch's more dignified and royal persona. Lady Jessica seems too young and dismissive and also less than royal while his son Paul also does not seem to have the royal statue either. Fifth. The color, backdrop were wrong. Most of the scenes were shot in unnecessarily darkened shadows, Caladan, the water planet, had too much earth in comparison to the striking Arrakis, the desert planet, and anybody who has experienced the desert would realize how bright and powerfully sunny such scenes should be. It was hard to see what was going on in detail with many scenes. Lynch was able to incorporate this light and darkness, water and sand to a brilliant contrast. Sixth. Little important details went missing, especially the poor use of voice over that Lynch captured the thoughts of Frank Herbert's novel that helped to enhance many of the scenes such as the observation that people were more important than spice or how Paul was able to fit a skinsuit so well. Seventh. Unnecessary fillers that included a scene of Jessica and Paul in a after a crash that was not included in Lynch's version while Lynch included an extended fight training scenes and the use of the voice that enhanced the development of the plot even even though the special effect was crude using the box. Dream sequences were not photographed well as dreams like Lynch nor the blue eyes as effectively presented. Villenueve also used too many dream shots unlike the more selective and carefully edited nuanced use of dream scenes. Eighth. Villenueve offered up too many reveals too soon instead of the more tantalizing surprise discoveries of the audience to experience. It is really hard to describe in detail all the problems with this movie with one screening, but it seems that what Villenueve created was a mainstream popularized version of a science fiction classic with plenty of special effects but without the compelling edginess nor the strong characters that Dune requires."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1160419/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt"," Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote. "," good, but not great ","I am a big fan of science fiction, but not of Frank Herbert. His style of ambiguous mysticism is simply not my cup of tea. Isaac Asimov's lucid clarity and sobering logic are far superior. Even Robert A. Heinlein's cynical humour is better. I read the first book of "Dune" but completely lost interest in the sequels. I watched David Lynch adaptation in 1984 with mild interest.On all accounts, "Dune Part 1" is a well-made movie, but that's it. To compare it to "Lord of the Rings" or "Star Wars" is tantamount to irresponsibility. I am not even going to waste time in pointing out its inadequacy. I would rather dwell on the positive aspects. As I said, this is a well-made movie.The plot, for those who have not read, or have forgotten (such as myself), is not unlike that of Game of Thrones - a supreme emperor ruling a number of vassal states and playing them off one against another. Here, House Atreides is sent on a mission, purportedly as the emperor's favorite and trusted subject. The real favorite, however, is House Harkonnen that will be benefitted by any setback or outright failure in the mission.The mission is to take control of dessert planet Arrakis (uncanny reminder of Star War's Tatooine) that is hostile in more ways than two. For a start, the climate is murderous, in a very literal sense. The native colossal "worm" is even more so. Finally, the indigenous inhabitants, the Freman, is not exactly waiting eagerly to turn over control of the planet, including its "spice", one of the rarest natural resources in the universe.Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac), wise and benevolent, is not prepared to obediently follow the emperor's vision of a violent takeover. He has in fact secretly sent out a sort of goodwill ambassador, his right-hand man warrior Duncan (Jason Momoa) to negotiate a compromise solution. Unfortunately, treachery strikes, ending with death of the Duke and capture of favorite courtesan Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) and their son Paul (Timothee Chalamet), who manage to escape using their mind-controlling-voice technique of the Bene Gesserit, an ominously mystery cult of "witches". They wind up on Arrakis and, after a nail-biting encounter/confrontation with the Fremen, which culminates in an alliance. As well, Paul meets for the first time in flesh Fremen lass Chani (Zendaya) who has appeared in his vision again and again hitherto.The visual splendor of this movie is undisputed. In addition to the above-mentioned, the star-studded cast also includes Stellan Skarsgard, Josh Brolin, Javier Bardem and Charlotte Rampling. Not much challenge though, for the impressive ensemble of acting talents. Only Ferguson and Chalamet have been afforded some scope for acting."

Because once it starts, it never stops. And even after the film has ended by putting a crushing weight on you, you will stay seated wondering about helplessness. The story of three cops finding themselves in the middle of caste politics cuts open some of the ugliest truths about our country and the world in general, and this time it's not the common man who is at the receiving end. This is artful, subtle filmmaking. Nayattu (The Hunt) is eerie."

Nayattu is not a film but a slap to the dirty system which includes politicians, police, casteism wolves and unfortunately common man too ","Nayattu (2021) : Brief Review -The Third Malayalam Classic of the year after The Great Indian Kitchen and Drishyam 2. Nayattu is not a film but a slap to the dirty system which includes politicians, police, casteism wolves and unfortunately common man too. Nayattu is told as a thriller and it somewhat thrilling too but it's not enough to be called a complete thriller as the genre requires more thrill. But it has got much more than that mainstream thrill to provide you a cinematic experience that will shatter your mind, heart and perspective and maybe you'll start looking at things differently. You need guts to make a film like Nayattu where you fearlessly expose all the dirty secrets of the system and then give a tight slap on common man's face by proving that he is also the part of this system afterall. Yes, we are all part of this absurd system because we are the Voters and we always fall for their tricks without knowing the actual truth behind it. Nayattu is about Three police officers who are on a run for life, escaping the outbreak against them due to the unlawful arrest and torture of a civilian. It brings in a few shades of arrogant yet very much human police officers and their helplessness and how they fail to fight the powerful system who just exactly know how to handle things.l according to their comfort. The film is bounded by realistic surroundings throughout the narrative and it doesn't fear to show ugly side of all the people who are involved in this system. Martin Prakkat has achieved something brilliant of a whole new level with his extraordinary directorial technique as he compiles multiple genres and themes so well together in one narrative. All the actors are superb in their roles. Dialogues are decent but very realistic and maybe that's why they are not that filmy. Overall, Nayattu is Classic Film but more than that it is a miserable realisation of our own mistakes that we can never correct as far as we are living in this society. A MUST SEE!RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11604676/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," A gutsy, hard-hitting survival drama thriller! [+75%] ","It's always interesting to see filmmakers who revel in light-hearted commercial cinema take the plunge into darkness. Martin Prakkat - director of Best Actor, ABCD, and Charlie - comes up with a gutsy, hard-hitting affair in Nayattu, starring Kunchacko Boban, Joju George, and Nimisha Sajayan. This is a survival-drama-thriller set against the backdrop of elections in Kerala.Nayattu begins with an interesting tug-of-war scene that you'll circle back to at the end for several reasons. For instance, in thrillers, cops are the quintessential hunters. Here, they're the hunted. Three cops (played by the actors mentioned above) are torn between the government's racy attempt at solving an accidental death case (to appease their vote banks in the upcoming elections) and their ongoing personal issues. A set of immediate personal problems are introduced: Maniyan's daughter is set to participate in a youth festival, which he hopes to attend. Praveen's mother is unwell. Sunitha's house is a work-in-progress.Writer Shahi Kabir (who previously penned 'Joseph', a film I only mildly liked) keeps the characters and situations rooted in contemporary realism. The cops are often playtoys of the ruling government; we see that politicians are quick to wash their hands off when the public eye is involved. A dialogue from Maniyan early on - an analogy between cops and goons - hits you out of nowhere. I'd say the first half of Nayattu is more of a nail-biter thriller while the second stretches slightly into dramatic territory but in just the right doses.A slew of solid performances dominates Nayattu. The three leads are terrific. Joju George lives and breathes as Manikyan, adding subtleties that help differentiate him from the other cop roles he has played. Kunchacko Boban is also spot-on as Praveen; he's the more rational one amongst the three and his lines reflect that. Nimisha Sajayan's role is subdued and less vocal, but she ensures that her emoting compensates. The supporting cast is equally good - be it Jaffer Idukki (as the cunning CM), Yama Gilgamesh (as SP Arundhathi), or Anil Nedumangad.DOP Shyju Khalid's frames focus on the right things. Palpable tension gushes through almost every scene in the first half and even when the setting shifts to Munnar, the camera rarely halts to appreciate the incredible beauty of this place. That final shot of a blind woman casting her vote is a statement in itself - a classic example of good writing boosted by the right visuals. Vishnu Vijay's score elevates the underlying emotions of several scenes.The only issue I had with Nayattu was its fundamental implication that laws empowering Dalits are often misused. In reality, reported cases of Dalit oppression far outnumber such instances. That hiccup aside, Nayattu is a worthy case study in how to tackle survival thrillers."

","Despite opening in theatres at the onset of the second wave of Covid 19, Nayattu received rave reviews from audiences and critics alike.And the Martin Prakatt survival thriller exceeded all my expectations on its OTT release tonight, delivering a gritty and compelling view into the lives of the average Kerala policeman.The story unfolds through its three lead protagonists who are police personnel wrongfully accused in a hit-and-run case and after a slow buildup, ramps up at breakneck pace and is sure to leave audiences hooked till the end.The painstaking detailed one-shot sequences and the raw authenticity director Martin Prakatt has imbibed into each scene reminds you of Abrid Shine's Action Hero Biju, but a superior script has elevated this film to classic, dare I say textbook status.National-award winner Joju George is at his best in the emotional scenes, while Kunchacko Boban and Nimisha Sajayan play their roles with nuanced perfection.Unmissable this one. I club it alongside The Great Indian Kitchen, Drishyam 2, Operation Java and Joji as my personal Top 5 Malayalam Films of 2021.This could very well be Malayalam's own equivalent of Bong Joon-ho's classic 'Memories of Murder' (2003) in terms of becoming a gold standard for realistic police stories going forward.Catch it on Netflix!"

"," Nayattu Is An Object Lesson On How To Subvert A Thriller Template ","Nayattu, directed by Martin Prakkat and written by Shahi Kabir, begins with a scene that I read as a metaphor: a tug of war between two teams of men. In the middle of this, there's a smiling politician walking about the crowd, soliciting votes. This sets up what's going to follow because the film itself is a tug of war between what we conventionally call right and wrong. The politician is important, too, and signifies the by-elections round the corner."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11604676/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," Best Film In Recent Times ","Nayattu is the best new Indian film currently streaming on Netflix (Orig. Malayalam w/Eng. Subs). Surely deserves multiple awards.Realistic with a tight script, a gripping suspense quotient, tragic events and a conjectural open ending. Outstanding portrayal of every character, great cinematography, locations and direction. What more could a film of this genre want !!!The narration though set in Kerala, is of incidents that can and do blatantly take place all over India ..sometimes these get exposed .. Disclaimer: if news reports are to be believed; people are eager to take offense in India at even a film review today.In short, Pravin (Kunchacko Boban) is transferred as a junior police officer at Piravom police station where he is assigned under senior officer Maniyan ( Joju George). A policewoman Suneetha (Nimisha Sajayan) at the same station has some problems with her relative Biju (Dineesh P) who is a political cadre goon. Biju and gang protest at the police station getting into a scuffle with Maniyan and Pravin. Biju gets locked up and roughed up but is released on his political bosses intervention. The party cadre start protesting against Biju's alleged mistreatment in the lock up. Separately Maniyan, Pravin, Suneetha and other police officers attend the wedding of a retired colleagues son. The men have a few drinks. Maniyan gets his non drinking nephew Rahul who is soon going to Saudi for a job, to drive them all home. A speeding motorbike suddenly crashes into the jeep. They get out to help the rider who seems seriously injured but is still alive.Maniyan realises it is Biju's comrade Jayan and they are going to get into serious trouble as the party cadre will pounce to blame the police. Rahul promptly flees the scene and Praveen takes over the wheel as they take Jayan to the hospital. Unfortunately Jayan is dead on arrival and the doctor smelling alcohol insists it will be a medico legal case. Learning that they are themselves police, he leaves it to them to inform their station. The party protests intensify as expected with things taking a major political turn as a by election is round the corner. Orders come from the CM (Jaffer Idduki) to arrest the trio. Maniyan being experienced in such cases, knows the dire fate that awaits them. The three manage to escape the station and with the help of friends, somehow manage to make it to the remote Chundavarrai tea estate in the Munnar region. Maniyan's old friend Anna an estate worker, tells them to hide in a disused old cottage in a far corner of the vast estate. Eventually, realistically depicted systematic police work bring a crack search team led by SP Anuradha (Yama Gilgamesh) to Chundavarrai where the suspects are sighted. As the. Nayattu (Hunt) draws to a close, Praveen and Sunitha run for their lives only to discover that Maniyan has hung himself at a dilapidated ruined old building. As Praveen and Sunitha are being taken into custody, Maniyan's phone containing his Dying Declaration holding himself guilty for Jayan's fatal accident and absolving the other two entirely. Thorough investigation has already unearthed that the real driver during the accident was Rahul, however political stakes are high and the CM decides it will be strategic in the by election for the trio to take the rap. In the meantime under great political pressure, three dummy lookalike suspects have been arrested and shown on Breaking News TV.The ending is for the viewer to discern. It could be either way. In reality there are so many instances where innocents are framed for political gain, languishing in jail for years before any semblance of justice is seen to be done. There are undoubtedly many more for whom there is no justice. Ever. If it were left to me, I would dedicate this film to those hapless souls.The goings on - regular and irregular at the police station are ultra realistic. Systematic police investigation is also shown very realistically making one concur that the police if they want and are 'allowed to', can solve almost any crime. Every character is superbly enacted, appearing ordinary real, even the goons - I have seen real political goon mobs with such menacing characteristics. The unofficial political hold by the 'super powers' over the agencies of law enforcement are essayed without needless melodrama. One need only to skim through the daily news to find ample instances of such abuse of power, anecdotally if not empirically. The subtly developing empathy between Sunitha and Praveen is sensitively portrayed as is the cold/hot bond between Praveen and Maniyan. Sub plots realistically narrate the family background of the trio.I have had the time for the past couple of months to watch a movie almost every evening on various streaming channels, in a wide selection of languages and genres. I rate Nayattu as the best film I have watched in recent times. Everything about this film is engrossing, watchable and so real. Do hope Nayattu gets the recognition it deserves. Well done to the entire Nayattu Team."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11604676/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Talking the current politics ","The Dalit issue is an important field that films discuss so many times but in the Malayalam film industry, it has its own way in a negligible amount. Dr. Biju and somehow Priyanandan show their interest in depicting dalit's topics but apart from the parallel cinema field, the topic is undiscussed till now. Here, in Nayattu not in the core way Dalit issue is not much projected but the film has its own shadows there. A brilliant survival story, the movie goes through the various depiction of political Kerala (not only around Kerala) and also how politics interfere in all sections of society especially in the force. It's a mixture of the current social scenario."

","This is a BRILLIANT movie, a 'real' thriller if you will, the likes of which you may not have seen before.Stories in general have to written and told in such a way that you care for the characters you see on screen, and this movie has plenty of that.Nayattu is a story of three police officers on the run, for a change. Why/What/Who, human helplessness/ego/selfishness, power, elections, some sad reality, and voting makes the entire story.It goes without saying, all the actors did an amazing job! Epic cinematography - night shots, drone shots, closeups, everything was good. The music keeps the intensity high throughout but people casually stop to have a 'chaya' that deliberately slows the pacing down and then brings it back up. I can go on but i'll stop. Would totally recommend this movie!"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11604676/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," Open question to your political conscience ","Theme is brilliant. Bold. Realistic.You are watching the movie thinking that the protagonists are going to escape from impossible situations as the script writer is on their side.However, that is a decoy. The makers have bigger fish to fry. And they present it in a way that you simply cannot ignore. You are all intent and looking for how the protagonists are going to escape the hunt, and then the movie springs it's net and traps you with realities that you can no longer shut your eyes to.The depth of corruptness in the system, and how justice is trapped across so many deep layers of trenches that you are left feeling helpless on how justice can be served amidst all this.At the end of the movie, in the protagonists, you see yourself and you are asked whether you would add another trench in the way of justice. The ending of the movie felt like the beginning of a much bigger saga.Background sounds have been pretty good and captures the tensions in the movie really well. Script is great and realistic.On the costumes and make-up side, there were some scenes that stood out like a sore thumb. Kunjacko Boban is seen with excessive makeup after days of struggling through the hunt - something that you would not see in a Dileesh Pothan movie for instance. However, in terms of subject, "Nayattu" beats "Joji" by miles in terms of how "Nayattu" presents something fresh where as "Joji" is old wine in new bottle.The communication between the makers and the viewers do not stop at the movie. Viewer is forced to probe his own conscience. And that is the power of the movie. The movie "Court" had left me in a similar state. This one feels closer home as the movie is set in my native.Joju and Kunjacko have performed really well. Nimisha has less of an opportunity on this one. All the other character actors have also performed really well.Martin Prakkat - take a bow!! Original content, original perspective, great direction - hats off!"

The hunt is intense with detailed preparation, shrewd vision, skilful execution and sharp performances. Even if you criticise it for the political inaccuracies, in all probability, you will only be too glad to have fallen prey to this cold and fierce Nayattu.****The flick is about the rampant influence that the people in power have over the Kerala Police and how the once predators go on to become the prey. Manniyan has been with the police for about 20 years. The ease with which he goes about planting evidence on the orders of his superiors without any guilt, confirms that it is not his first time. The newbie Praveen also tags along, not protesting once. It goes without saying that Sunitha too is part of the corrupt system. However, as certain unprecedented events occur, Manniyan, Praveen and Sunitha find themselves on the run from their colleagues, after having been framed by the Govt to save its face in the upcoming elections. Karma would soon lay hands on them, leading to a spine-chilling climax.There are many applaudable aspects about the flick. The presentation of minute details for one, is commendable, like the tattoo on the arms of Praveen and Hakkim, both of them being members of Kings Piravom and Manniyan's lungi that gets drenched in urine, upon his suicide. Man-management and true to life subtle portrayal of various events in the life of a police officer are admirable, like the mention of collection of cash towards an ex police man's son's wedding and the DYSP dropping his little girl for an excursion, right before taking off for an important manhunt.The lead performances of the seasoned Nimisha Sajayan, Joju George and Kunchacko are indeed praise-worthy. But, the performances of the highly relatable and charming IPS officer, Yama Gilgamesh, the unblemished and compassionate Vinod Sagar, the frustrated yet helpless ASHO, Jithu Ashraf deserve special mentions. Apart from a few supporting roles, who were slightly awkward in terms of dialogue delivery and screen presence, performances were by large, convincing. Only Jaffar Idukki, I thought, was a miscast. Perhaps, an actor with a more intimidating demeanour could have filled his shoes.The portrayal of politics is maybe inaccurate in reference to the actual ground scenario and some of plot lines do close in on being a little exaggerated, nevertheless, this flick is to be relished and you would only be too glad to have fallen prey to this cold and fierce Nayattu."

The theme was very good. But the execution was not good enough.At first, the police and their behaviour seemed very realistic. But then, they start overreacting in places which is an off putting thing. There is a bit of exaggeration and bit of melodrama which takes away a lot of the fun. They could have come up with a better story where the stakes are higher.Film loses its charm by the last portion. All the good build up in the beginning never pays off in the end.Acting was very good from the three of them, with Kunchacko Boban giving us a very nuanced performance. Nimisha and Joju too were very good, but it's something we have seen before. They have already did those kind of acting before too.Music too was good. In fact the technical aspects were all very good. Just that the story/script was not impactful enough."

I am struck by the faith that they profess to the Gods, the customs and the culture that they show through the scene in the Theater. I am a Latin woman and I am not used to seeing women eating alone and not sharing with the rest of the family, I imagine that there are more customs where women are excluded, but I cannot do anything about it, they are customs that have been preserved until now and I imagine that they are happy that way.

But the relationship between grandparents and grandchildren has that load of unconditional love from older generations and is the same throughout the world, the happiness that a visit from a grandchild creates is highly demonstrated. The story that shows the ternuna and the happiness that this visit generates is sustained with suspense generated from the disappearance of the chicken and determining who was the culprit. The location is great and is excellently portrayed through a beautiful photograph. I highlight the performance of "grandfather", an endearing character."

There is nothing original neither in the argument nor in the dialogues. The romantic subplot and twists more than 1000 times seen. I am a fan of Jos Mota and Carlos Areces and I cannot understand how both have participated in such nonsense. You don't need a writer to make this film, only copy & paste.Regarding the actors, the main ones are simply ok (Jose Mota and Pepe Viyuela) and are simply ok most of the secondary ones (Carlos Areces very well as always), but a few of the secondary actors are terribly bad (very very bad) and even embarrass others every time they appear.In short, watching this movie is a total waste of time and money.

Or will time have moved on, well as Billy Murray's John Morgan soon discovers, time waits for no man and in his absence enter the ever so suave Bruce Payne as Damien Osborne to lay down the rules of the game.Of course Frank Morgan has other ideas and along with his wife, Sadie played by Jeanine Nerissa Sothcott and daughter Kate played by Roger Moore's granddaughter Ambra.With a movie of this kind, how do you inject something fresh into the proceedings, as I mentioned previously it all begins at the beginning with the very brief prologue, who is this little girl and what part will she play during the ensuing proceedings.Of course with Frank Morgan's arrival back on home soil, this ignites long fuelled passions of anger within the community plus it reinstates the passion for justice within Nick Moran world weary police officer Frank Conway, can he finally put his stamp of authority on the the returning Morgan and make the streets just that little bit safer? Or will his own demons take hold and derail his own sanity.Whilst entertaining to a point, there are some issues, certain scenes go on way too long, the direction isn't exactly flashy given that the Director James Crow is more known in certain circles for his frequent foray's into the horror genre but this assignment was a last minute gig as he replaced the original director Adam Stephen Kelly, who wrote the script for this movie.There is a very jaw dropping scene involving Miss Sothcott, which at first glance was perhaps not needed, but if you recall the movie world of Roger Corman and his insistence that if the plot is flagging throw in some mild nudity.Granted afterwards, I did ponder and wonder if the scene between Miss Sothcott and Lucy Aarden's character of Zoe that followed afterward should have went in a different direction.The storyline is a little strained in terms of trying to follow it but no doubt revisions played a part in certain elements of the coherency of the plot, I must say though the scenes between Nick Moran and Ricky Grover as Billy in the bar room scene were excellent, very understated with both actors bouncing off one another with some choice dialogue, in some respects Nick Moran's character pretty much stole the show.Billed as a home invasion thriller, this aspect comes into play with the party scene, and the events that follow with double cross shenanigans revealing themselves between all parties plus we get a twist in the tail which as twists go did sting a little as the plot devices used to wind up the story didn't at any point suggest what had happened in the life of Frank Morgan previously.The movie itself has been a huge hit regardless of what I or any one else's think, and having been on the set of this movie I understand the blood sweat and tears that went into making it, but perhaps if they hassle given themselves more time and filmed at a later date we might have gotten a more polished production but to be commended regardless."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11618350/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","1"," Garbage ","From the trite, over-done dialogue to the trout-pout, fake EVERYTHING bimbo, this is a total waste of time. I cannot believe the hype that surrounds this film!"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11618350/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," Terrible acting, plot holes, weird dialogue but still watchable ","'Nemesis' initially peaked my interest when I saw Nick Moran in the cast of a classic gangster movie. Whilst Billy Murray and Frank Harper's acting skills won't set the pulse racing, I figured I knew roughly what I'd be getting. I was wrong.The first thing that immediately stuck out like a sore thumb was the strange dialogue, obsessed with everyone finishing each sentence with the other characters name. Remember the classic lines in Snatch:"That sounds like hostility doesn't it John?" "Oh we don't like hostility, do we Errol?" "No we don't John".It's like that the whole way through. Ok, I quickly knew who every character was but there's better methods of writing that can achieve that!Acting was atrocious the whole way through, typified by the bizarre casting of Jeanine Nerissa Sothcott, who literally can't move anything above her lips. Whilst not a criticism of her as a person or her appearance, a basic pre requisite of acting in this kind of role does require an actor to be able to express different emotions between enjoying a nice glass or red wine or having a gun in their mouth. Sadly, she can't.There are some classic clich scenes, some bizarre ones and downright ridiculous ones. Very early on we get the druken copper going to the draw, putting the gun in his mouth and not going through with it. Never seen that before....Then we have Moran at a complete loss with his life, walks in a bar and then a long chat with a guy he used to know completely changes his life around. Really?Then to top it off we have 2 people with guns arguing over who's going to shoot a guy, when said guy is standing right there pointing a gun back at them. What? If he had anything about him he'd have shot them both whilst they were bickering. This was just blind ridiculous.The main storyline actually wasn't bad but there's so many other random things going on with sub plots, it's just like a brainstorm of ideas bundles together and ends up a complete mess. A big meeting together between 2 big gangsters, taking up the best part of 10 minutes in the movie, which ends up having absolutely no relevance to the story at all. A filler scene, of which there are many.Whilst generally being a terrible movie, it's curiously watchable. I don't know if I can give it any credit or it's just my love of the genre.How anyone can give this a high score I've no idea. Movies are subjective, sure. But this is one of those that makes you very suspicious of any 9's or 10's. 'Mediocre' is a big complement to this movie."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11618350/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Seems some reviewers havent even watched this film. ","Looking at some of the reviews for Nemesis, i suspect that some of the negative ones didnt even watch the film as their reviews are so vague and could literally be about any film. But their reviews are their reviews and so I thought I would share mine. And yes I did watch the full film (twice at the time of writing this on IMDB) Well. To say that I thought I knew what to expect before I pressed play on the film would be true, I have seen a large amount of British crime films over the years and I thoroughly enjoy a lot of them, but after a while you do learn to predict the way the films will deliver what they deliver, and even though that's true in most cases, I still enjoy watching them and see if something different will appear before my eyes. Sometimes that happens, and sometimes it doesn't.With Nemesis, the film began and the story developed the way I thought it would, giving me that sense of comfort when watching a film featuring a cast of familiar faces that I enjoy watching onscreen, I settled in for a near 90 minute crime romp, which is no bad thing. Some of the dialogue felt a bit stage like and more deliberate than say natural dialogue, and I was fine with that. It was just the films style I don't need every film to be groundbreaking or to feel like a docu-drama. But then a strange thing happened just when id settled into a comfortable predictability feel for Nemesis. The film surprised me with a gear change part way through and then headed into different territory and I was then engrossed in a story and setting that did feel stage like and I loved that aspect of Nemesis. It felt like this could actually make a pretty damn good stage play (for those who have seen the film, you'll know which portion of the film I am talking about) Whilst early in the film, some plot elements felt like they didn't really need to be included, made perfect sense as to why they were included, and certain characters who behaved a certain way that made me uneasy, made perfect sense as to why they were acting the way they were before the heat in the film was turned up.If you asked me only a short while into Nemesis, if i was enjoy the film, id have said 'yes its okay' but ask me after the end credits have faded and ill tell you that I did thoroughly enjoy this film and would recommend it to those who like smart films with some pretty great character drama that unfolds in the running time. Yes it has its cliches, and some might say scenes that are a little predictable (im not one of those people though) as I genuinely didn't see the plot coming until right just before it arrived. The cast are great and whilst the cameo of Bruce Payne is a scenery chewing one, it still puts a smile on your face. There is also a wonderful side story scene (kind of) featuring Nick Moran and Ricky Grover that I could have watched for a full film. Ricky Grover demands your attention in that scene and gets it with his performance, and dialogue with Nick as well as a subtle tone of a music soundtrack over the scene that helps makes the scene one of (but not THE) favourite scene in the film. Nice work Ricky! Also and you'll know it when you see it, there is a scene stealing scene by Jeanine Nerissa Sothcott that seems a little storyline jarring but makes perfect sense when you think about how emotionally strong her character is. Great work Jeanine, you helped create one of the years most memorable characters for me.So I do recommend Nemesis, and the one tip I will give you. Please don't think you know what you are going to see before you see it. Yes you'll think you've seen all this London gangster stuff before and in places you might be right, but let me know after you've watched the full film, what you thought."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11618350/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Good little British gangster movie ","I really liked it - not as much as We Still Kill The Old Way, but I still enjoyed every minute of it. The conversation between Billy Murray and Bruce Payne in itself was worth watching.The plot is somewhat convoluted, like someone had several different sketches in their mind and tried to pull them into a coherent story; it may have been better to focus on one angle only instead of introducing the vengeful policeman and the victims of trafficking at the same time."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11618350/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","1"," Totally disjointed ","Wow thats got be be the worst film I've seen in a while, very disjointed, the only character that showed any promise was Bruce Paynes but he was only in for the blink of an eye shame the whole film wasn't over that quick.Why have we lost the ability to make British gangster films ?Just a quick note to producer's and directors looking to make one, do your homewor, know your subject material watch how it should be done as a starter watch The Long Good Friday you might actually learn something."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11618350/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," A welcome slap in the face ","The gangster genre has always suffered from woke reviewers critiquing a film's politics rather than what's on the screen. If you like your gangster movies raw without the director holding back for fear of cancel culture, this is the film for you.Thoroughly enjoyable invasion movie with plenty to please any would-be East End geezer!"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11618350/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","1"," Without a doubt the worst gangster film ever made ","This film should win a worst gangster film of all time award."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11618350/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," Great cast of British acting legends ","Been waiting to see Nemesis for quite a while! With a lead cast of actors I love; how could I not? An amazing powerhouse performance from Billy Murray in a role he fits like a glove! Rest of the cast includes legends like Nick Moran who has some masterclass scenes; the brilliant Frank Harper and Julian Glover. Well cast supporting actors too. Lucy Arden is an actor to watch whose character took me by surprise. There are some really tense British gangster meets horror scenes which were shocking in their realism. Intensely directed by James Crow. More Jonathan Sothcott produced movies for me please."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11618350/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","1"," OMG...Please DO NOT waste your time, PURE GARBAGE ! ","The plot is something straight from a wanna be gangsters mind just before his addiction to crack got out of control. Jeanine Nerissa Sothcott just CAN NOT act, she is gruesome to look at and she really should just stop with the lip fillers. Used to like Billy Murray , has been in a few decent things ...YEARS AGO....but it seems these day actors will do anything for cash, even this kind of garbage. This is 1hr 27 minutes of your life you will never recover from. Just go and re-watch Goodfellas. Nuff Said. You have been warned! The good reviews are from people directly or indirectly associated with this film."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11618350/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Abovr average home invasion movie ","Before watching the film I though here we go another run of the mill Brit gangland film but what a nice surprise Nemesis was. It was original gripping and the acting all round very good. Billy Murray always ads class to these Brit films. Good first outing from a new production company and looking forward to the next movie from Shogun films."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11618350/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Original story that's better than most. ","For me British gangland films are like Marmite you either love them or hate them well I loved it. There was plenty of blood and gore after we got to know the various people involved and some great tension between the brothers played by Billy Murray and Frank Harper. The lead actress Jeanine Sothcott was both voluptuous and believable as wife Sadie. An enjoyable 90 mins with just one small disappointment thad to wait until the final credits to hear the Bond like theme. Worth an 8 in my book.."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11618350/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," Unexpected love for this! ","I was expecting a gangster film but lets face it not much gangster stuff in this. It had a few scenes of gangster but it was dressed up to be gangster but ended up as a slasher movie and the film is more like a horrord at the end of it. If you want a good film to watch that isn not a gangster film then this is the film for you but dont ever think this is a gangster film. It has gangsters in it but not a gangster film. 10 as it was good."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11618350/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," Billy Murray is the duracel bunny of British acting ","Nemesis is the perfect bedrock for Shogun Films...visually it is polished, the actors narrative in the first part of the film gives you a set of keys to open the main lock in the second part of the story...once you have opened the door you are quickly dragged in to a finale of retribution and power..If you have never watched a Jon Sothcott film then this is the one to get you hooked... As British producers go the man is the guv'nor.. a well polished entry to his extensive catalogue and long may he reign over his kingdomBilly Murray provides a linchpin performance, the plot rotates around his aura..the characters feed from him and together they build a growing tension that explodes in an eruption you will not expect... Jeanine Nerissa Sothcott gives a solid polished performance (as well as packs a punch that would floor Tyson Fury) With a supporting cast strong enough to grace bigger budget projects NEMESIS is without a doubt a diamonds in the crown of British film making...FOOTNOTE...I appreciate other opinions in their reviews but i do question their reasons for giving low reviews and insulting this film...i look upon that as petty jealousy and urge you to give this film a go, and give it the honest judgement it justly deserves."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11618350/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," Up there with WSKTOW ","Loved this movie, definitely up there with Sothcotts best (we still kill the old way & vengeance) Billy Murray and Nick Moran do what they do best and lead a fantastic array of talent including a great Cameo performance by Ricky Grover.. (I love Ricky Grover) The whole look and feel of this film was amazing, it was a different story to anything I've seen before as you had the bad guy vs the bad guy which I found quite original.. All in all another great film to add to the Sothcott stable and a triumphant first film for Shogun films."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11618350/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Great evening's entertainment ","Producer Jonathan Sothcott has mastered the art of delivering popular cinema that gives his punters just what they want.Plugging into the zeitgeist of 2021, this Britflick gangster/home-invasion mash up has a story which may be far fetched, but still makes for a gripping, ripping yarn.A cast of familiar UK regulars - and even a glimpse of Julian Glover too - make for a rollercoaster ride that culminates in a dinner party to die for. Good fun!"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11618350/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","1"," The Worst Gangster Movie... Is it even one..? ","Stupidest movie... No Action sequences. I had one of the worst headaches after movie. The movie is like Old man trying to reach for his pills shown in 2hrs with nothing to discuss. All they do is talk talk talk its all runs down to only few words the character names and What do you want?"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11618350/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," Pleasantly Surprising ","I was expecting this to be a fairly run of the mill film but it really isn't. Billy Murray--the lynchpin of the film--is incredibly watchable and very well supported by the likes of Julian Glover, Ambra Moore and Lucy Aarden. The plot, though a tad predictable, is very good and the story is very well told. Thoroughly enjoyable!"

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11618350/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," The Return of the British Gangster ","Not everything is as it seems in Nemesis..... Brilliantly acted by the main cast with a slick style to the production and direction. The script has some great fleshed out scenes giving each character its place and with more than one surprising sting in the tail. Well worth a watch and a throw back to a good ol fashioned "Brit Gangster Flick""
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11618350/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," A Good Twist on Gangster Formula. ","Nemesis brings together a stellar selection of gangster film stalwarts, with Billy Murray taking the lead. One might expect standard genre fare, and for the opening half the film plays up to that, before switching gears and entering 'The Purge' territory. Without giving too much away, the script from Adam Kelly plays the daring game of making the central Morgan family morally questionable. Ultimately you need to root for a protagonist and it's testament to Murray, Jeanine Nerissa Sothcott and Ambra Moore that we're able to still fear for their plight, even when righteousness may not be theirs. This is where Nick Moran and Lucy Aarden bring an interesting counter point as three characters converge in the finale. Moran in particular is superb.Despite some rough edges, and a little too much exposition in earlier scenes, I enjoyed Nemesis a lot, particularly for performing a nicely timed rug pull. Elsewhere, Bruce Payne appears in a role which you might expect to have more of an integral part than it does eventually (again, part of the flip up). Payne chews scenery with his inimitable style of course. The end probably needed a bigger moment, something a little more violently explosive, but the setting is suitably claustrophobic.Solid work all round and always a pleasure to see so many British acting greats converge. It'll prove divisive for those expecting more by the numbers but it's a thumbs up from me."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11618350/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," Entertaining Thriller ","I found this movie a slick, well written and constantly engaging thriller. Some superb performances from a very solid cast with Moran being a particular stand out. The third act is especially great with many interesting twists & turns. Overall NEMESIS is an entertaining flick that I'll be sure to revisit again."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11618350/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," A great British thriller that really delivers ","There's no doubt about it if you like this genre you will love Nemesis - packed with gangster film legends including Billy Murray, Nick Moran, Bruce Payne and the brilliant Frank Harper! The girls are all very easy on the eye and the plot is very clever. I hope there's a sequel!"

I think one thing that I found interesting was that this film hints to pays homage to the genre, from films such as Dawn of the Dead, and also Resident Evil.

But the writing, the plot holes, the directing and even the acting were well below par.The movie felt like they gave a bunch of money to high school kids to make a movie and these kids decided to make a Zombie movie because they thought it would be cool. And then to try to differentiate they decided to plagiarize other recent Zombie movies and throw in a Zombie love story, and in an effort to be original and to also use the movie as a platform to showcase their special effects capabilities (spoiler alert!) throw in a dinosaur at the end of the movie as well, which wasn't even that great.Don't waste your precious time to see this movie, but please let your voices heard to tell movie makers in Malaysia to stop laundering money and make better movies that all of us can be proud of - we are better than this."

The singer group DOCE (sweet) was a singer band formed by four lovely ladies that were famous and successful in the seventies of last century in Portugal and this movie is biographic and tells the creation and setting of the band and all the problems found because of it. The four actresses that perform the DOCE ladies band do an excellent job. But all this is rather uninteresting."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11621960/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Good, but not Excellent ","I'm Portuguese and I usually don't like Portuguese movies, although there are amazing ones. I'm a young adult now and this film is about a band formed in the late 70's early 80's and it's so good!! It's a good movie to laugh, cry and overall enjoy! Is it the best movie I've ever watched? No. But is it good? Yes! The acting is top notch!"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11621960/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Finally, a good and recent Portuguese movie ","I'm Portuguese and am not a Huge doce fan, however I DID find the movie interesting.Portuguese movies are usually slow, badly lit and have horrible sound. I will however give credit to a few recent ones that were rather good in at least 2 of the the 3 above. (So Jorge 2016 for example, by Marco Martins).This film in question guides us through the biography of probably the most famous (and first) Portuguese Girl Pop band. The plot revolves around the story of the largely popular quartet DOCE (or "sweet" in English) who started playing together in the early 80's. Formed by Fatima Padinha, Teresa Miguel, Lena Coelho and Fernanda de Sousa, we understand the struggles of an all-girl singer group who thrive during a recently overthrown dictatorship that still leaves behind a largely misogynistic-minded country.Despite the (usually) low budget, photography was beautiful and the script was fantastic. The four actresses (Carolina Carvalho, Brbara Franco, Lia Carvalho and Ana Maria Ferreira) played each of their parts wonderfully who, as an added bonus, resemble the original singers. This also obliges me to give great credit to costume and make-up design teams who were on point conveying the extravagant outfits of the decade.Overall a refreshingly solid movie despite the typical funding limitations and huge congratulations to the Director Patricia Sequeira for her work."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11628854/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," Closing Night - at Fantasy Filmfest ","This was the final film that played at the Fantasy Filmfest in Germany (and will be playing in a few more cities after Berlin and Stuttgart to be more precise, in the next couple of weeks) - and what a film it is. It reminded me of some really good slow paced and creepy horror movies I have seen - and a bit of Stephen King (in more than one way).We got a foreword by the director and she sort of said ... well revealed something major - a twist that is. I will not do that, even though apparently the movie has been misused to spread a certain kind of message. To that I can only say: do not read too much into certain things! This is a horror movie and while it does have something to say overall, this is not (covid) pandemic related.Great actors and if you are like me and do not read anything about this ... quite a few surprises coming your way ... with a lot of Christmas songs to counter the mood - but no Last Christmas or Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer ... in case you were wondering."

I wasn't a big fan of Irumbu Thirai, and I definitely do not consider it the benchmark for cyber thrillers. That being said, there was a certain level of finesse in its making, and the cat-and-mouse antics in the second half made for mindless popcorn fare. Chakra, initially touted to be its spiritual sequel, is unintentionally hilarious in many scenes, wastes an efficient actor like Shraddha Srinath, positions Vishal's character Chandru as "always-one-step-ahead-of-the-villain" (which is a terrible move for thrillers), and has cringy one-liners from Robo Shankar.Regina Cassandra, I'd say, was a weird choice to play the antagonist in this movie. I get it that writer-director M. S Anandan was going for a suave, stylish villainess in Leela but the writing for the childhood portions (played to great effect by baby Krithika) of this character towers over her adult counterpart. Yuvan's score is also a letdown this time around. The biggest bummer here is the writing - replete with unbearable lectures, a puppet of a police department that simply sucks up to a military officer, funny coincidences, idiotic-but-massy moments and what not!"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11640022/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," Unexpectedly surprising 2nd half ","The first half of the film was utter worst to the core that it makes us feel like not watching these kinds of films in theatres ever again but if one would sit idly by biting their nails till the 2nd half, it really would surprise with the twists & turns that not many would've predicted, especially with Yuvan's mesmerising BGM, it just takes us to a different level, although the content revolves more around the same cat & mouse game in a slightly different flavour."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11640022/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," A decent movie ","The storyline was good and decent. Some fine twists and a fine ending. A good family movie you can go for during weekends."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11640022/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Superb story and Superb acting ","The storyline of this movie is good and acting is also superb but expecting more suspense on the story. Overall this is a very good movie."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11640022/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Irumbu Thirai legacy carried on ","Completely worth your time. An enjoyable action flick."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11640022/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Producer Vishal overtakes the Hero Vishal ","RATE 6/10 Language: TamilOne man show movie. Interesting start and it is diluted with too much of heroism... when here orders IG and everyone in police, the movie started to get bored. Other than Hero, everybody in Police is zero. If you can bear this, the movie is watchable crime drama... Not much of information like "Irumbuthirai" its just another crime action."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11640022/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," Chakra ","Brilliant Movie Vishal Was At It is Awesome Work Regina Was Also Superb acting Direction Was Gd Screenplay , Climax Is Superb."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11640022/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Good film ","Chakra - A decent and neat heist thriller. Performed very well by Vishal and Regina Cassandra. It's alike an unofficial sequel for Irumbu Thirai."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11640022/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Decent Story ","Easily can be watch for once. Decent Thriller Story. Technical Aspects as Bad as usual. Nice try. Not a bad movie."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11640022/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","2"," Simple crap ","No logic movie again by Vishal, Movie after movie as he is trying to showcase himself as hero, making worst movies.Better watch only if you get it in OTT or on TV,"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11640022/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","1"," Worst movie ever ","Such a illogical movie.. Such a waste of time.. Vishal acting is very worst.. THIS movie created hype because of his previous movie irumbuthirai but let completely down.."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11640022/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," Started like Irumbuthirai but ended like a mediocre movie ","The way this film started was amazing and suddenly dropped with so much of flaws and loopholes. Easily predictable scenes and dialogues makes it a not worthy watch. Pre climax portions was actually dragged to get the 2 hours length mark. The hack person was found before the 30 mins of the movie itself, but as like the most of tamil cinema scenes dragged by a challenge which was taken by hero and the villian which makes it even worse climax. No songs to drag more wad only the best move. Try it at your own risk."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11640022/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," Awesome Thriller ","Nice thriller movie to watch. Vishal done a reasonable acting in this movie. Some predictable scenes however movie running like marathon. Music travelled with story is very well appreciated. Yuvan always rocks. Director done his study on Data Sharing Services and Hacking which is nice. Some cinematic scenes and without songs i never get bored. Twist in the Climax always good. Nicely Done Team!"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11640022/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Worth watching ","Just tamil cinema movies have no much intelligence but this is not bad. Worth watching.. fully entertained. Good one regrading new tech."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11640022/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," A mediocre one. ","An absolute ok-ish watch...a strict one time watch if you are totally free..the movie contains many clichd elements..and cringey moments that are the negative parts of the movie... Everything else fine..screenplay could have improve."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11640022/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Could have been a masterpiece then got wasted ","Movie started with a bang and high note which later introduces protagonists to lead the story. The digital India, Data Security is highly spoken of, and had so much chance to use it all through the movie, but it wasn't.Since the antagonist has been revealed, her skills were very underused and just treated like normal villain. She could have played better games with use of her skills but story was never written like that. Direction and Story was big disappointment for 2nd half. Still it's a good for one time watch."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11640022/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," a decent enjoyable one time watch film ","If you need a different hacking types you can watch this."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11640022/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","1"," Tamil movie lack of intelligence ","One of the worst. Lack of intelligence in the whole movie. I have no clue wether they have research before they direct this movie. Do they know what is cyber crime?? How intelligen hacker could be? Please watch lots of english, Turkish , korean movies to get knowledge how to direct good thriller movie. Waste of talent as well. Tamil movie always like to show female lead as dumb and whole movie will be on male lead. Never able to change their narrow mind site until now."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11640022/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," Movie falls so flat ","Cyber crime is a very interesting topic now. Because it's a new thing and as ppl are learning more and more about it. So anything about hacking is generally quite intriguing and a good story can be made out of it with just a few types of like cool hacking stuff. But my god they really didn't think this movie through. Lacking logic in many places makes this a missed shot. Typical hero dialogues. Lot of dragging in the end. If they had hired a cyber crime consultant maybe they could have come up with a better story. Irumbu thirai was great and gripping and serious. This had none of those qualities."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11640022/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," One Time Watchable ","I don't understand how people are given it 10/10. There was no suspense .we already knew what's gonna happen next .Negative rule was too easy. There was no mastermind fight between negative Rule and Hero .And like any other Tamil movies police brutality was in it."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11640022/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," HIGHLY OVERRATED! ","Usually I don't review movies... But when I see overrated and Underatted I come here to review... More than 2000 people are reviewed it and it got 8rating, I don't know why people give 7-8-9 stars?Frankly this movie is not one time watchable nothing in it utterly cleche!"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11640022/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," Chakra (2021) ","Chakra Movie's first half is very Quick but second half has so much lags . Bgm are good as usual . Yuvan Shankar Raja Sir did his best . Vishal sir's Acting is good , Regina Cassandara Acting is okay . Shraddha Srinath mam's acting is okay . Chakra is Good film After Vishal's Sandakozhi 2 (2018),Ayogya (2019),Action (2019). This flim is Like Irumbuthirai (2018) ."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11640022/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Meh ","It is an alright movie. It was worth watching honestly. Plot was alright has the right amount of spice and twist is also sensible."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11640022/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","2"," Watched the movie seeing the rating...but WASTE OF TIME!!!! ","Most of the scenes doesn't make sense.1. Can a military officer actually solve police cases involving in every aspect of investigation??2. Shraddha was in charge of the case and Vishal was acting as if she was his assistant.Regina was okay, didn't expect a lady villain character from her.Climax gives clues for the second part. Please please don't come up with a 2nd part..please."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11640022/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," worth watching ","Thriller! Twists! Action! no songs; only BGM - plus Regina & Vishal - "
