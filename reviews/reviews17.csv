"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11143400/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," A Good one to watch... ","Storyline as everyone says... is not so fresh. But, that doesn't make the movie going dull at any moment. Movie starts with no background details about the hero on why he is frustrated with his married life, what's their love story and no masala about time machine invention etc. In just about 15 mins we jump into the Time machine... and the story kick starts to tell you all the details as it moves on... so we don't need to keep things on head and match them with later incidents of the storyline. Guddos to the direction and screenplay for that.Comedy track is decent enough. We still have Santhanam's counter dialogue comedy and all the co-actor did their part very well to keep you engaged with some smile on your face. But, this is not a comedy rollercoaster type movie though. However, that's not needed either, we have some time machine logics to focus on too. So comedy track is not too much and not too less. Good enough for the storyline and for the chosen actors.About Santhanam: I like him from his Lollusaba times.. I was not so happy when he decided to move out of comedian roles to do Hero roles. But still wanted him to be successful as a Hero for his own good. But his movies become little stereotype, with him still doing his comedy along with hero track (as thats his strength and I still want him to do that though) but with lot of masala storylines. But, this movie is the first one I felt like he tried something new. His look is so fit to the character, and the acting is much better than his earlier ones. No mass hero type masala stuffs. He still did his comedy portion in the movie, but who will say NO for that. Good acting Santhanam.. Wish you all the success and keep going and rock the stage.With time machine storyline, it is so easy to leave bunch of logic holes throughout... you may find some in this movie as well... but I would say the director managed to minimize the logical mistakes covering some of them with comedy track.Overall, the movie is a decent one to watch. I enjoyed it."

",""Dikkiloona" is a must watch "Comedy" film for all set of audiences and it is a surprise comedy package from Santhanam.The film has an interesting comedy plot and without re-opinion, this film can be considered as best film of "Hero" Santhanam as on 2021. Rather than solely relying on "one-liner" dialogues, Santhanam has preferred a wise script.Apart from Santhanam, many artists (Yogi Babu, Anandaraj, Munishkanth etc) are there to trigger your tickling bones.The film humorously showcases the cultural demolition prevailing in our society, in the name of "Modernization".Forget the logic and watch it as a full length "Comedy" entertainer rather than considering this as a "Sci-fiction" film, since the "Sci-fiction" factor itself has been trolled and parodied in many scenes of the film.Personally, I recommend to watch this timepass entertainer along with your friends."

"," Sarbath, On Netflix, Is A Not-So-Refreshing Drink ","Sibling rivalry is something that Indian cinema loves to focus on. And if the siblings in question are the central characters, it gives all the more room for the filmmaker to let them bicker over who's stronger. Later, however, the brothers will casually slip into the mystic river of banter and you'll come to know that blood is thicker than sarbath.If you find two brothers quarrelling in the introductory scenes, you can be sure that they're not going to let an outsider poke his nose into their petty business. The anger that builds up inside them perhaps stems from their inability to confront one another due to the fear that it may take a wrong turn. But if you allow the film to flow for an hour, you will see that beneath the veneer of ego, there's love that can't be contained in words. The Telugu masala comedy Race Gurram (2014) uses this theme spectacularly."

"," Lacks a lot of things ","I'm not sure if I should feel bad for Kathir for getting bad projects or be pissed off at him for choosing them. The actor can do wonders - as showcased in Pariyerum Perumal - but here he's just another young man with a short fuse. How many of those have we seen in the last 100 years! It doesn't help that he begins to stalk the heroine. It doesn't help that his character is underdeveloped save for a few mannerisms. It doesn't help that almost all the characters are stereotypical.There's no originality in the film. Take the scene where the hero and heroine meet for the first time. He's at a bus stand and he gets slapped by the girl who is soon told by her friend that he's not the one who had been harassing her. This meet-cute/slap-cute trick alone has been used in a handful of films in the last decade.Sarbath just doesn't cut it.

","An ambitious anthology project from director Chimbu Deven, Kasada Thabara has several good bits but doesnt gel together well enough to be called good cinema.Composed of 6 interconnected stories, the movie follows the story of a pharma laborer, a school custodian, a police officer, a don, a wannabe con artist and an office clerk as they deal with extenuating circumstances thrown up by mishaps in their lives.The thin thread of commonality between the storylines is maintained well and certain characters will definitely stay with you. Sundeep Kishan as a daring police officer and Harish Kalyan as a Machiavellian con-artist stand out in terms of performances while the talented Regina Cassandra is under utilized.Venkat Prabhu, who also produced the movie, excels in a nuanced role that holds together most of the storyline and shines especially in the emotional sequences. Unfortunately, the storylines involving Vijayalakshmi and Sampath wear too thin and fail to strike a chord with viewers.A well intended project that falters in 2 of the 6 parts due to inconsistent storytelling and faulty performances. All said and done, however, the remaining 4 stories are impactful enough so that overall, the positives outweigh the negatives.A decent one-time watch.

Her physical strength is justified by previous sequences where she lifts heavy weights(cylinder) with ease and the way she carries her son all by herself to get his treatment. In one word she is a FIGHTER. One of the best roles she has done in a long time.2. Casting Except Venkat Prabhu every single character has done well. It is understandable that he is confused as to what's happening to him. However it looks too idiotic when he doesn't understand even when after he is convicted. His acting looked unnatural. Maybe someone else could have done justice to the role of a wrongly convicted person. He could have sticked to production alone in this one.3. Chimbudevan has done a decent movie after pulikesi. Even though it's a collection of different stories, the way it is connected makes us feel engaged and keeps us on edge. I dint feel this in the recent flurry of anthology films released in ott recently, Especially navarasa.4. Dialogues were well written and apt to the script. Number of references to all living beings are equal and if we deserve to live then every single animal or bird deserves to live with proper food and shelter. This message gives a nice touch to the movie. There are few quirky dialogues which will make us laugh at unexpected moments.5. Music was very good but at some places they feel too forced or was not needed. Like the song which keeps running in the background which could have been saved for the album.There are few things which I couldn't understand like the use of different cameras or screen dimensions for two of the parts. Harish kalyan getting adopted so easily,etc maybe a second viewing would be required to understand them."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11146072/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," Watchable movie, but odd storyline... ","I sat down to watch the 2020 movie "Behemoth" from director Peter Szewczyk solely because it was a horror movie that I hadn't already seen before. Sure, I didn't even know what the movie was about, nor had I actually ever heard about it prior to watching it. I found the movie's cover interesting, and of course I ended up watching it.While "Behemoth" was watchable, it was a movie whose title really made no sense in context of what the storyline was about. So I must admit that I didn't really get the meaning of the movie's title. As for the storyline, well, while it was watchable, it wasn't an outstanding movie. Now, don't get me wrong, because it is not a boring movie. It was just, however, a movie that made very little sense and was feeling more like a series of randomly shot segments put together to make a single movie. It sort of felt like writers Derrick Ligas and Peter Szewczyk set out to accomplish a bit more than they were actually capable of delivering with the movie.The acting in the movie was actually fair enough, despite the actors and actresses having very little in terms of a proper script, storyline or characters to work with. They had a good ensemble of actors and actresses in the movie.Visually then "Behemoth" was an interesting movie. But special effects and visual effects could only do so much for a story that was driven by a fairly bland storyline. I liked the creature design and the way that the creatures were brought to life on the screen.Now, I wasn't a particular fan of the storyline, but the movie was definitely watchable, albeit not a memorable movie, nor a movie that I will ever be sitting down to watch a second time.I am rating "Behemoth" a five out of ten stars."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11146072/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," An enjoyable if slightly flawed effort ","Stuck in a troubling situation, man and his friends decide to confront his former boss of a chemical company about their pollution problems affecting his daughter, but when the situation escalates and they take him hostage, it brings about more than just corporate secrets as their hellish situation continues.Overall, there's quite a lot to like with this one. Among the films' more impressive features is the strong central setup involving the search for the truth involving the conspiracy that's being laid out. Without much knowledge but just enough to go on the idea of his child's ill-health and the strange chemical company cover-up that seems to be the source of the sickness and infection that's plaguing his family, the start to this one comes off quite nicely when brought up alongside the ongoing martial strife and the quest to uncover the truth that eventually leads to their confrontation that brings about the kidnapping that brings about the glorious second half to this one. As the group tries to make sense of the situation that continually grows out of hand with every second they're at the motel, this one grows increasingly fun with a lot to like. With the trippy visuals not only brought about by the influenced suggestion of their kidnapped host trying to play mind-games to get the upper hand as well as accidental ingestion of recreational drug instead of medicinal, the Satanic images that come about, are kept nicely in line with the growing realization of what's going on with the chaos of the situation. Featuring creature attacks, a series of double-crosses, and a fantastic reveal of the truth behind their captive, there's so much to like about this part of the film. That all works nicely on top of the fact that there's an impressive amount of effects work for such a low-budget film of this type. With a series of creatures on the loose here, including deformed and garish goats, a massive articulated spider-like being, and numerous other beings that show up throughout the night in an effort to further the mind-games being played, that it's usually hard to tell the CGI creations from the practical effects displayed here. As well, the graphic gore here, with head-smashes, arms cut open with glass shards, a decapitation, and much more, there are quite a lot to like with this one that manages to hold it up over its few minor flaws. This one doesn't have much in the way of flaws but there are some issues. The biggest factor with this one is the possibility of being let down by the cryptic nature of the conversations carried out during the kidnapping and holding him hostage. While the whole idea of the experience is to be shrouded in mystery considering the ending reveal that comes about, since the surprise is so heavily hinted the obvious nature of the twist makes the cryptic mind-games and conversations feel like padding at times. The other flaw here is the aforementioned obvious twist in the finale where it's used so frequently that there's no real surprise when it's revealed, but it's not that detrimental overall.Rated Unrated/R: Graphic Violence and Graphic Language."

The mystery element is compelling enough even if it seems simple by the end. The effects they managed to pull off on this kind of budget are beyond impressive.The movie has its faults but the only thing that really seems to drag it downward is the acting. Our leading man is by far the worst but there isn't much acting here that I would call adequate. With some better actors this could have been a 6, maybe even a 7, but the amateur hour was nonsense. I understand that it is difficult to find the best actors on such a low budget but surely there was SOMEBODY better out there.Anyway, this director shows promise and I look forward to seeing where he goes from here."

Don't get me wrong, it's not that I didn't like it, I was just not as fond of it as many others were back then. Having said that, I imagine fans of that movie will like this too.One thing you have to keep in mind here: the movie gives you more questions than answers. Also it provides ... well some answers in pieces - you have to put them together. So the main character is doing this - that should mean that this happened in between, right? And what about that character? Saying certain things, but is he telling the truth? Also what are those noises from upstairs? Again - this warrants multiple viewings and even then I doubt you'll be able or fully satisfied."

At times I really had difficulty with paying attention to the dialogues and what's going on. The acting isn't great. There's almost zero gore and just a very paranoid character slits his throat. The masks in the footages and the ending are pretty eerie tho. I think the main idea of the film is very intriguing but it felt a bit too slow for the most part.His wife has been missing so every time there's a signal hijacking, there's a woman that goes missing prior to that. When he saw this pattern, he became obsessed and he swore to find out who did those hijackings. There's a young woman that was following her. And she helped him with the investigation and when he woke up one day after they talked to the owner of the storage unit. The motel room and his house were wrecked and he watched another footage and made out the location from the footage. He found the guy in a dilapidated house with the set of those footages and he forced him to do the confession video with a mask on and killed him. He buried him in the garden. The ending was quite creepy. He hit someone with his car. It was the robot bride bleeding on the asphalt."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11151336/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Dark web material ","For many, the hype for such stories like this often try to disassemble the human psyche. Since the internet was in full swing during the nineties, many closet directors wanted to make little clips such as the video in the movie so that the public can shake their heads and ask -- why?Why go to so much trouble in creating a video which contains oddities such as the masked robot? To create strange noises so the viewer gets confused? Well for some it's a good way to hide a body as the film suggested.This and other clues within the video tape so the protagonist remains fully aware that his investigation is going nowhere. During the early years of the 21st century, the dark web had crept in on the net. Inside of the web, many strange videos that could leave one wondering -- was that real? Or are they just jerking off?It's pretty much both. If one could navigate the dark web properly, you would find horrifying clips beyond description but it's also dangerous to do so since the FBI had gotten involved and started shutting down questionable sites. Some of which were cleaned so well, that you could eat a steak off the sender's floor.Broadcast intrusion is a lot like the dark web for its disturbing material content. A robot, mysterious deaths of three women, the sudden disappearance of Jame's sidekick who helped him, yet bolted once he was getting too close. It's as if she was protecting whoever made the videos painting her as an accomplice.Then there's the so called real killer. Did he kill the women? Possibly. Maybe. Or - maybe not. Since James killed him after the confession only to run down a person on the road, which turned out to be another robot left unanswered questions. Like the suicide victim in the alley way, James will remain on the trail to the real answer, but not any time soon.This is what the dark web is. It's full of loopholes, obstacles, puzzles, clues that lead nowhere. James may be smarter than some, but everyone knows that sociopaths and psychotics often have IQ'S that are up just a little higher than most. The killer, had that look on his face when James said, "we're going to do a video." Which made the so called killer smirk a bit. Telling the audience -- Hah, hook line and sinker. Just like the rest.Broadcast has a lot of loopholes and open pages, but each page is to be written by James himself. If there is a deep conspiracy group out there, then there is definitely other hidden factions who work together to make the puzzle as difficult as possible to figure out. Hence, the odd videos, or broadcasts on the open web or dark web. It's all just a smoke screen to hide their real agendas.Radical groups that stay in the closet until they're ready to expose themselves in the guise of strange characters like robots or faceless creatures are those who have absolutely nothing else better to do. Probably because they couldn't make it big on the silver screen or become a famed poet or author or some other form of entertainment. Or even an investigative reporter or archivist such as James who had real motives. Mysteries will remain the same no matter how far the FBI will go to stop them.I like this film. It made me question the motives of the piracy signal that led James on a wild goose chase to nowhere. A few twists and turns here and there gave the movie some depth but without all of the needless existential proclivities that other films contained. Music was a nice touch for the near ending shot. Actors were on the ball with their own persona blended into their roles. Not a lot of action, but then again, talking about the net and video piracy laws are not that exciting to begin with.I give it eight out of ten stars. Wonderfully shot, good locations, and a well thought out script."

So here's the thing, a lot of people have the belief that if the viewer didn't understand it, they must be idiots. No. When you make something so obscure, there is no plausible plot or reason, it becomes nothing. It's not artsy or edgy, it's "I ran out of ideas and made it weird". Not everyone enjoys the same formula and a level of avante-gard is appreciated but this was so vague and weird, it missed the mark. It was disjointed and seems like a lot of extra work for someone who just killed somebody and then supposedly wanted to confess, it just didn't make any sense. This was for a pretentious palette and apparently most of us are just hicks. The actors did a fine job and the filming was nice, but that was it."

I can begin with the terrible acting along with a very tedious plot, and an aberrative ending. Basically, the movie is surrounded by a fixed idea of an incompetent and depressed archivist, catching clues about a tv hacking from some years ago, in the end, he eventually found the culprit and killed him, and then we witness the most pathetic scene of the movie, when he runs over a woman with his car, but wait a minute, it wasn't a woman, but a robot, wtf?At least you can cure your insomnia with this movie, I caught myself almost falling asleep a few times."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11160650/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Sundance 2021: On the Count of Three carries enough humor, but it's the emotionally investing screenplay and characters that steal the show. ","If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Even though On the Count of Three isn't exactly a comedy or a light film based on a silly premise (How It Ends), I did expect humor to play a big part. In this regard, I wasn't disappointed. Christopher Abbott (Possessor) is particularly funny with all his self-debates about taboo matters such as racism and general discrimination, but there are several meaningful messages "hidden" in the seemingly comedic scenes. Let me also praise Jerrod Carmichael for his grounded, emotionally compelling display and for his terrific directing. The actors share impeccable chemistry and transform a supposedly close friendship into something really authentic.Val (Carmichael) and Kevin (Abbott) are incredibly relatable, which could make a movie about committing double suicide a bit dangerous. The screenplay from Ari Katcher and Ryan Welch is carefully written in a way that clearly demonstrates how different people deal with depression, sadness, stress, and so many other aspects in life that bring people down. Fortunately, these characters are built and developed in such a rich, enlightening manner that the ending - while shocking in its essence - works beautifully as a message that life is worth living no matter how tough it might be. This might be a confusing statement to write for people who have already seen the film, but it all has to do with the care that the viewers gain for the protagonists.The first act puts them at equal standpoints regarding suicide, but throughout the runtime, it's shown to the audience what happened in each of their lives. It's the subtle conversations, the apparently insignificant jokes here and there that ultimately turn the climax so emotionally effective. The best compliment I can offer this movie is that the ending - despite being somewhat expected - clearly transmits to the public what's right and wrong. Technically, exceptional camera work from Marshall Adams (beautiful long takes) and an amazing score from Owen Pallett elevate the overall picture. I wish the characters could have been more explored, but having in mind the short runtime, it's truly a great piece of filmmaking.On the Count of Three is one of those films I know I'll undoubtedly rewatch more than just a couple of times. Boasting two phenomenal performances from Christopher Abbott and Jerrod Carmichael (also the director), the genuine chemistry between the two actors elevate a close friendship into something that makes the viewers deeply care about their fate. Tremendous praise to Ari Katcher and Ryan Welch's screenplay, which is definitely the element that makes this movie one of the best I've seen this year. By writing it with extreme care and responsibility, the predictable yet impactful ending doesn't leave a margin for doubts about what's right or wrong. Everyone deals with the bad moments in life differently, but life is always worth living. I felt emotionally invested in the main characters to the point of wishing the film was longer so that the writers could dive deep into these protagonists. Technical shoutouts to the impressive camera work and remarkable score. In the end, I couldn't recommend it more.Rating: A-"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11160650/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Comedic, Emotional, and Filled With Heart ","Two guns. Two best friends. And a pact to end their lives when the day is done. One the Count of Three is today's crowd-pleaser, but on a different note. The parallels between this and I Don't Feel At This Home in This World Anymore feel all too real, especially since that one won the dramatic competition a couple years ago. The seriousness of suicide juxtaposed to the comedic best friends works perfectly. Christopher Abbott and Jerrod Carmichael have wonderful chemistry together. The casting is great. The script covers many topics, suicide being the main one, in a manner that lingers in your thoughts. For example, the last shot spoke so much without saying anything. For a directorial debut, Jarrod Carmichael did fantastic. I love actor-directors because they understand both sides, it's just the execution that is the question when going it. But there's no trouble directing here. Along the way, there's a few spots that slow down and didn't exactly work, but it still manages to work well in the end. By the way, the third act is done so well and one to think about. Moments throughout of the beauty of life and friendship made me like it more and more. I believe this will either win dramatic jury prize, audience dramatic, or maybe even both. One of the best Sundance has given us so far!"

A comedy about a man (Carmichael) finds out his best friend (Abbott) tried to kill himself 3 days prior and now wants them both to end their own lives. The subtlety in Camichael's performance is absolutely fantastic. When watching the film just take note of his level of emotion he is showing in each scene and how it changes as the film moves on. It is most interesting when he isn't talking. It is expertly done by someone known for just comedy. Abbott also shines as the damaged and crazed friend with 1999 Justin Timberlake hair who is dangerous one minute and sweet the next. The comedy lands throughout the film and this is because the film trusts it's audience to understand what is satire and what isn't. Their is no crowd-pleasing apology scene for its subject matter. No monologues about what we learned today. The film knows what it is and it's done well. I watched it with someone who was personally affected by suicide and he thought it was handled well. However if you're easily triggered this is not the film for you... and that is okay.

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11162178/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","2"," Ugh ","What if you combined a Ouija movie and a riff on Battle Royale? This is a question that I never would have thought to ask but here this movie is to answer.Karen - yep, that's her name - is an American housewife living in Japan who desperately wants to fit in. This leads her to play Kokkuri-san, which is like Ouija but also astoundingly Japanese in that it summons an animal spirit that is a mix between a fox, dog and raccoon. The fox (kistune) is the trickster, the racoon (bare-danuki) is the bearer of both mischief and fortune, while the dog (inugami) is often used as a curse.By using three bamboo rods arranged to make a tripod and a pot is placed on the tripod. Three or more people ask questions of the spirit and the pot either moves or remains still, which can be explained away just like a Ouija board. And just like one, this game has plenty of urban legends.As far as I know, it does not install an app on your phone and give you credits to buy weapons and kill other housewives to the death.This is director and writer Masaya Kato's first movie as well as the initial effort for much of its cast. It also shifts between bad English and subtitled Japanese and none of the voices match up. All of the blood seems to be CGI. Man, should I keep this laundry list going to let you know just how rough this movie is?Great idea. Weird idea. Goofy idea. Whatever - the execution fails to live up to what this could have been."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11165716/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","1"," Naw ahh... ","The first bad sign is the woke diverse cast. Only in Hollywood does the makeup of a group of friends consist of every race. I only mention it because when I see it, it feels forced and phony, especially since Hollywood is forcing filmmakers to include a diverse group of people to get included in the Oscars. I just hate casting based on some arbitrary made-up quotas.A character named Adolf? Really? (face palm)It was just a bunch of random scenes trying too hard to be American Graffiti. The music didn't help. Why all 50s music? It made no sense at all. It was so out of place and jarring. Nor did it make any sense that he never heard of Bob Hope after 20 years of living with his dad who was a fan. Growing up you just get to know what your parents like.The other issue is the lead girl is 27 years old playing an 18-year-old.Of course, they had to address all the social justice talking points. The writing wasn't interesting, funny, or engaging. All minutia, but not Seinfeld-style funny minutia. Then a bunch of useless background information, which wasn't even exposition, so there was no real point to it. I just quickly checked out during the dialogue. Nor did I buy for one second that this skater was a church-going guy.They all had the intelligence of 5-year-old kids. This was a woke dumb, dumber, and dumberer.After 45 minutes I had no idea where this movie was going and it just never went anywhere. His relationship with his dad was one noted. When someone gets an opportunity to make a film, which is super rare you should be on point. This was not, unfortunately, because I like to root for independent filmmakers.The best part of the movie was the meeting with the Abigaile. That would have been an interesting relationship they could have explored because Rachel was a bore-fest and there was no reason for her to have a relationship with Michael.The drama and fights between Michael and his friends were lazy and phony. It was almost like a bunch of home movies put together. And Michael didn't seem to fit in at all and his falling out with them was forced.It was 90 minutes of "Good Will Hunting" trying to focus on skating while his dad trying to get him to go to college. That was it. Not every idea is a story. A story BUILDS and takes you somewhere.SKIP IT!"

","I liked the way it was filmed - the composition and even the lens they used but the story felt unfinished. I think the film should have been longer or have a better ending. I wanted to see the main character make a part and get sponsored or win a contest and see his dad waiting for him to bring home the money and the trophy. The ending was just not satisfactory. The dialogue's alright. The friendship between the three friends was portrayed realistically. That's one thing that was done right in this film. As I mentioned before, the one thing that made this film enjoyable was the cinematography. That wide lens look is what kept me from looking away. I would love to see more films shot with a wide lens.Overall, the film was just alright. I think if Illegal Civ keeps making more films they might be on to something."

Special merit has to go to Vince Vaughn, who once again demonstrates he's become one of the finest actors of his generation.Thoroughly enjoyed this film, it really is a joy to watch, and probably the best praise I can give it is that I was actually quite upset when it ended. It could have gone on much longer, I wish it had."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11165716/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," coming of age. Great film for the right people. ","North Hollywood is a simple story, stretched out sprinkled with side stories, skate clips, music, montages,etc. The story is about a boy who is trying to make his skating dreams come true with his dad half way out the door.( supportiveness wise), friends growing apart, and a new love interest. North Hollywood's plot portrays Micheal to be very over his own head, His skating skills are (generously) above average. A mix of all that and a kid who so obviously shouldn't be mouthing off, comes out so a entertaining fun movie. Keeps you wondering how bad he might get himself beat up."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11165716/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt"," Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote. "," Really hit home for me! ","As a teenager today I could really empathize with Michaels struggles of friendship, love, and passion. I felt his pain and anxiety throughout the whole movie but at the same time could see both sides of the argument between his friends and family. Not only that but a lot of the things Micheal experienced I somewhat experienced myself, the troubles of having a girlfriend and a best friend at the same time, having your family want you to do something you didn't wanna do and drifting away from close friends. Near the end when Micheal and Adolf made up and hugged I teared up a bit because something exactly the same happened to me once but me and my past friend never made up so it really made me think of him and how we both should have changed and learned and grew together. I also could feel Michaels passion to be cool and hangout with pros and having a friend who is just a loser, again I went through the same thing. I could really tell that the people making this movie understood being a skater and being a teenager and how tough it is. I also thought that the actor was superb, Vince Vaughn and the lead cast did incredible in their roles and I could feel the tension while watching. The only critiques I really have are from a director stand point like how some of the scenes are a little misplaced or filmed funny. In all I loved this movie and have already watched it twice today. I recommend it to anyone who is or once was a skater in their teen years."

","I'm gonna keep this short and straight to the pointThis is Mikey alfreds first time as a director and for the first time it's great. However some of the writing especially Miranda cosgroves writing felt very unnatural and it felt like she was reading a script and trying to put emotion behind it. On the other hand in my opinion Ryder, Aramis, Angus Cloud all were very surprised me in their abilities Nico Hiraga was good don't get me wrong just some of his like delivery was very strange.The story is simple and straight to the point it also doesn't waste anytime from the very beginning he wants to be a pro skater and he strives for it.Overall a very good film for a debut and I'm excited to see where this team and this director goes in the future."

Acting was pretty horrific all around. Vince Vaughn... it felt to me like he regretted taking the role and just went through the motions without trying to hurt the directors' feelings. Female lead brought nothing to the table. This is dilettante filmmaking at best by a director and writer who think they know film because they've seen Goodfellas a hundred times. So has everyone else. Just watch Animal Chin if you are in a nostalgic mood. This ain't it."

","Ha-ha-ha canonade of verbal comedy eruption, with so much nitwitty philosophical reflections on love and life, in art and sports. It starts as a road trip and ends in the courts, not the judge's but the tennis court, and to call this a sports movie will be an insult to the sport, and to call it a comedy is also an insult of comedians, and if you name it a romantic love story among the best, youre high on something.I had one abrupt laugh in 98 minutes and that maybe cause im old and grumpy a man, it flows just at the average with nothing new or original, not nescessarily a low budget flick, but it makes you fatigued on daft and silly jokes, that mostly harrash the human race of irishmen, and the script and screenplay tailored for the two young main caracters in such away you feel like there are two standup comedians standing on each side of the court throwing words of love,wisdome agony and hate at one another. It tries to be intelectual but its not that funny but they are smooth like a criminal on their acts.Shall i recommend this for the quirky libertarian theater skidder? No ."

","I was lured in to watching the 2021 action comedy movie "Average Joe" from the cover/poster, as I must say that it did seem like it could be a fun movie.Sadly, the best thing about this movie was that cover. Yeah, the movie is a low budget and low-key superhero action comedy, but with a twist. Yeah, this movie doesn't have super buff young men with muscles in places you didn't even know could have muscles. No, these are superheroes with dad bodies. Yep.Well, while that concept definitely has potential for some good comedy, then this movie just fell very short of delivering much of any entertainment or enjoyment that appealed to me. So this movie was a swing and a miss from writer and director Mark Cant.What made "Average Joe" fail here for me was the pacing of the storyline and the fact that the character gallery in the movie was just insanely monotonous. So there was just little of anything worthwhile here for me.Now, I am sure that a niche film such as "Average Joe" definitely will find an audience out there somewhere, I just happened not to be a part of that particular audience.I am rating "Average Joe" a generous two out of ten stars, as the movie just failed to entertain or impress me on any level."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11166554/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," Just average, Joe ","This is a bargain bucket of the Marvel Avengers (perhaps the rejected characters the late Stan Lee thought of but quickly discarded) but the fact that the writers poke fun of themselves makes this more enjoyable that I thought it would be. Perhaps it also pays homage to Watch men.The acting is ok. Who cannot route for the average Joe?! It has semi funny moments and I can see why it was released in January."

Most mothers tell their kids, "If it's too good to be true, it probably is." Young Doctor James McCune (Thomas Hobson) has decided to take up the offer from his Uncle Matthew (Phil Morris, who "Seinfeld" fans will recognize as outrageous attorney Jackie Chiles), and become the town doc in North Fork. The year is 1866, and after an eventful trip that sets us up for a horror film, James arrives to find one of the earliest 'gated communities'.Upon arriving, two things stand out to James. First, it seems all of the North Fork citizens know his name and have been waiting on him to show up. Second, he's fascinated by the sight of a mixed-race community living in harmony. His bright-eyed awe shows his wondering whether this this some type of Utopian society? Not long after he realizes his Uncle Matthew holds the power position in town, James begins to notice the cracks in the faade of his new found paradise.The town's characters are quite a bunch to behold. Torb, the multi-talented blind barkeep is played by the always-fun Tim Blake Nelson (recently seen in OLD HENRY). Tara Perry (the film's co-writer and wife of co-director Jordan Wayne Long) plays sharp-shooting Annie, not one for putting up with much drama. Her rather large, protective brother William is played by Joseph Rudd, while Angela Bettis as Lucille and David Arquette as Douglas play normal and annoying - I'll leave it to you to discern which is which."From one seed an entire forest can grow" is the film's opening quote, and it takes on an entirely different meaning as the story progresses. A gathering red fog indicates the menacing ghosts are present, but are the forest ghosts the real threat? Co-directors Jordan Wayne Long and Matt Glass, along with co-writers Long, Sean Anthony Davis and Tara Perry have adapted their 2016 short film into a ghastly fun feature, with Mr. Hobson and Ms. Perry reprising their roles. As we've learned power plays come in many forms, and sometimes legends are used to distract from the truth. Thanks to this film, I have a new guideline: any movie that features Tim Blake Nelson singing with an Irish accent is automatically worth watching."

"," Gourmet romance story ","This movie is mainly destined to gourmets - whom I am not - so maybe that's for this reason that I hardly feel any taste in my mouth watching it. I was at first afraid to be COVID infected - absence of taste - but I fastly realized that I focused on the wrong link to appreciate this dish movie. I preferd Ted Kotcheff's WHO IS KILLING THE GREAT CHEFS OF EUROPE? Which was far more delightful than this one. Actually this film has to be seen as a drama, romance, nothing else. It remains an interesting movie after all, the rest concerns only a matter of approach. Nothing else."

I went in with little expectations and came out satisfied having seen a nicely presented picture. The only other Michelin-star-level cooking film that I remember watching is Burnt, which was a TOTAL train-wreck, so the bar was set pretty low.The plot perhaps lacks some substance, but in other respects the film delivered. It was nicely framed, the performances were good all around, and the characters felt real. This especially goes for Frederik. A character that would commonly get downgraded to one-dimensional home-wrecker, in this film he gets just enough spotlight to show how he also was yet another victim of the ambition to get that coveted Michelin star."

She gets into a fight with the clic of girls involved with the prank and they all get detention. While in detention, they decide to perform a seance to contact Kerrie.It's all very average and middling starting with lead actress Suki Waterhouse. The story, the location, and the filmmaking are all middling. It's not actually scary although it's a little spooky. The twist is not shocking as much as it's a relief that it makes sense. The mystery is the same. I'm just glad that it's not completely stupid but the reveal is a long information dump."

We see more girls getting killed.Forget those cute "The Craft" type outfits. Yes they wear them, but the same effect isn't there. These are scared girls and not witches.

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11188624/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","3"," Tedious, slow paced, uneventful and boring... ","Sure, when I sat down to watch the 2021 horror mystery movie "Seance", I can't claim that I was harboring much of any high hopes or expectations to the movie. Why? Well, the premise of it and its synopsis just made it seem like it was going to be another one of those a dime a dozen standard young adult horror movies.But still, giving writer and director Simon Barrett the benefit of the doubt, since it was a movie that I hadn't already seen, I sat down to watch "Seance".And I gave up on it shortly after crossing the halfway mark. Man, talk about a trivial and generic horror movie. Everything that transpired within the storyline of "Seance" is stuff that has been done and seen in countless other horror movies, and quite often done and seen better in other movies. So yeah, "Seance" wasn't all that and a bag of potato chips.The storyline, aside from being generic, was incredibly slow paced and uneventful. So it was quite a struggle and an ordeal to sit through this movie and find even just anything remotely enjoyable.Well, that was not entirely true, because the acting performances put on by the cast in "Seance" was actually quite good, especially when taking into consideration that the actresses and actors just about had virtually nothing to work with in terms of a proper storyline, interesting characters or anything else for that matter.For a horror movie then writer and director Simon Barrett was off the mark by miles. There was absolutely nothing scary about the movie. Well, not unless you count sitting through a rigid and wooden storyline as being scary.If you enjoy horror movies, do yourself a favor and give "Seance" a wide berth. It just simply isn't worth the time, money or effort.My rating of "Seance" lands on a generous three out of ten stars."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11188624/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Slightly flawed but enjoyable enough genre effort ","Arriving at a prestigious boarding school, a woman joins a group of girls with ties to an accidental death of a fellow student and tries to help them investigate what happened, but when they start dying one-by-one come to believe the rumors of a ghost on campus might be true and try to stop it before it takes them.This was an enjoyable if somewhat flawed genre effort. When this one works well is the generally enjoyable and chilling atmosphere of the boarding house setup. This gets quite creepy at times, as the ability to capitalize on the setting including the darkened, falling-apart building featuring tons of shadow-play, flickering lights, and a series of scenes featuring something lurking out of the darkness to blow out lights unexpectedly. This setup brings out some rather creepy scenes here with the failed seance at the beginning, the prank in the storage room where they get their prank turned around on them and the revelation about how everything ties into the legend of the murdered girl at the school which sets them off on the journey to uncovering more about her which fuels the final half. There's also a lot of fun to be had here once this one gets the killer loose and starting to knock people off. The first few attacks, with the masked figure appearing suddenly around the now-split-up group to generate some suspenseful attack scenes, start this off nicely into later scenes. After the reveal happens and the plans for everything are known, this gets incredibly fun and enjoyable over time as the confrontations that arise here with the survivors confronting the human killers and their plans getting interrupted. These provide a strong sense of action here with the brutal back-and-forth encounters that have a lot of stalking, a series of fun brawling trying to get the upper hand, and tons of great gore in the impressive kills featured here. These generate enough to like that hold it up overall. There isn't much wrong here but it does have some issues. Most of those drawbacks come from the predictability and generally cliche approach here. The film tends to feature tons of factors from dozens of Ouija-board-summoning genre efforts, including the homemade planchette and presentation, the board behaving oddly that no one admits to doing, the investigation into the original girls' disappearance that starts everything, and the authorities that are acting way too suspicious for their own good. These all come off as way too frequently utilized in these kinds of films and can make this one feel less original than what it really is. This one does run on a bit too long with several false endings that don't need to be there, but otherwise, there's not a lot to really dislike here.Rated Unrated/R: Graphic Violence and Graphic Language."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11188624/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," pleasantly anachronistic ","Writer-director Barrett has some serious skills when it comes to scripting and camerawork, but he chooses to hide them behind styles and tropes that are somewhat out of time. The only valid criticism of SEANCE is that, if you ran it through a B&W filter, you would end up with something that would be completely appropriate (and well reviewed!) for a theatrical release from the 1960-1965 era. For the wild youth of today, however, woke or not, the subtle movements in the storyline may however fall a little flat."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11188624/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","1"," A bit intense at the end, but overall full of boring conversation, and super annoying overuse scene! Not recommended! ","This film start with a bunch of people summoning the ghost, and we found out just a prank scene! As turnout, this film is about a disguise student "Camille" need to find out who responsible for the death of her friend "Kerrie"! We found out is Bethany, and Trevor! Entire film full of boring conversation, and annoying overuse scene! Such as, overuse of the walking scene, overuse of the searching scene, overuse of the staring scene, overuse of the jump scare scene, overuse of the lamp flickering scene, overuse of the calling names scene, overuse of the arguing scene, overuse of the sleeping scene, overuse of the shouting scene, overuse of the seance scene, overuse of the texting scene, and overuse of the talking on the phone scene!

Not sure what else people want, I think it's also a follow the reviewers syndrome, it seems a lot of people follow early bad reviews and the same with so called great films. I'm noticing most if the best films lately fall in thev5s. Definitely recommend you watch this. It's no classic but very well made film. More of a who run it thriller with a pinch of horror."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11188624/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," Low-effort disposable horror ","I really can't rate this movie very high. It's about a girls' school where unusual things are going on. Is it haunted? Who is this new girl? What about the strange history of the school? It seems to have the right ingredients, and for a while, I was invested in it. It turns out there is a ghost, but that is not what is causing the string of deaths. It was one of the students who did not want to get caught plagiarizing the essay that is her ticket to college. And the headmistrisses' son is involved. The characters weren't that interesting and the ending was a let down. As far as spooky movies go, I would say look for something else a little better."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11188624/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Extraordinary ","When a movie can draw my attention and watch intently, it definitely a success. Objectively speaking, it keeps me think of who's the murders and how the ghost play part in the story. End up it's not lame and the enjoyment via the story are top notch. Good writing and story telling this movie did. Quite a long time didn't watch good horror like this."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11188624/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," A pretty enjoyable slasher ","I shipped Camille and Helina the entire film and I wasn't wrong. Camille was at the school under false pretenses and she left saying she'd contact Camille. The killers were the maintenance guy who's also the head mistress's son and the girl who looked like Daphne from Scooby-Doo. Her motive was that she plagiarized from Keira and won a scholarship so she had to kill her and the rest who'd know it belonged to her. Genius! And the guy? He's just a murderous freak. The original side of this film is that there's indeed a ghost and it's Keira's but she's not murderous and that's groundbreaking because if there's a ghost in a slasher film, it has to be the killer. Some grounds have been broken apparently. The killings weren't very impressive but the masks and their historical background were good. They were used in the Classical Japanese theatre by men that'd act as a woman on stage because women were forbidden. Camille's character were really interesting. She's a good girl but she also put up a good fight with the mean girls especially Alice who's the only survivor apart from Camille and Heline. The guy's head was chopped off by Camille and she also killed the female killer in a very brutal way. She slit her throat with a broken LED lamp and it was the goriest since in the movie. The film is named as seance but I think the seance scenes were not very effective and interesting and I somehow knew it was one of those girls. All in all, it's really nice to watch a slasher without the intervention of any supernatural presence. The only con is that the school was really small. I mean it looked so good architecturally but I needed some endless hallways for some chase scenes like in Urban Legends but it's pretty enjoyable as it is, too."

But everything seemed to work itself out and again there was a nice tidy explanation to the whole thing that made it all worth while! Pretty cool. I think the thing was a nice exploration into society and our educational system and the insides of the hierarchies of the inner-workings thereof, I am digressing but I enjoyed it , kinda sad how the chicks all perished but it was cool , kind of like Scream or something but it was I think a lil' more entertaining or just as much I don't know , I can't really remember Scream that well. But anyway at least this wasn't like nonsensical drivel or anything it moved ahead and explained itself , so that is good!"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11188624/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Atmospheric spooky mystery ","Typical boarding house with mean girl cliche starts the film, with new girl arriving and upsetting the dynamic. But, was a supernatural legend awakened right before the new student arrived? The movie unfolds with a supernatural sense to the deaths, but what is happening isn't fully clear. Good acting (if a bit annoying given the tropes of adolescent "mean girls") and decent plotting made this an enjoyable watch for me. It isn't outright scary exactly, but the mystery adds to the atmosphere and helps the spooky aspect be present but not overwhelming."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11188624/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Good enough for a slasher nowadays ","Maybe 3/4 too many songs and I was not totally conviced by the performance of the love interest of the main character, however this is a brilliant film, a celebration of different cultures with a common identity and the power/importance of the immigrants in a country. Very good performances by the majority of the cast (don't sleep in some of the oldest ones), very well directed and edited, with great choreographies in every scene. A filme with more than one message and all were delivered pretty well.This is cinema, even for someone who usually doesn't love musicals."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11188624/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," Terrible casting fails what could have been a decent movie ","Another one of those awful casting decisions. Grown woman, some in their late twenties (and looking so) playing spoilt preppy brats is once again quite laughable. Why directors believe the CV's stating 'playing age', is beyond normality, do they look at up to date head shots or actual age? Subsequently you spend most of the film questioning said decisions and wondering if any females in the mid-teens actually exist.As for the film, well direction is fine, the story is ropey, going from idiot girls to Nancy Drew and almost Scooby-Doo in places, which would have been believable if teens were in the roles. Seasoned horror fans will guess the plot, deaths and reveals as nothing is actually new. The score is a consistent annoyance, going from 80's to 40's, to orchestra to synth etc, but you will watch and see worse nowadays.However you still can't get past the terrible casting and dreadful acting, the ballet scene drives home just how bad it actually is."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11188624/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," Enjoyable ","I love a good revenge movie and this was one to a T. At first I really thought there was a ghost, but what happened was better then a ghost. This movie had you guessing the whole way though. Although it was a slow burn it was perfect, compared to other new movies that just do not make sense. Good story and the acting was believable, which is also hard to find now a days. I recommend if you like teenage drama/thriller. To say the least I would definitely watch this one again great acting and cast."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11188624/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," A gritty and dark horror film disguised as a cliched boppy teeny horror movie. ","From Simon Barrett, a mumblecore horror screenwriter icon, and Adam Wingard's creative co-host, comes Barrett's directorial debut. Another staple in what I call the "V/H/S universe". I love this "universe". Anything involving the core people of the mumblecore horror scene from 2008-2015 I absolutely admire as they have truly inspired me at an odd time in my life. As Adam Wingard sells out, Barrett stays rooted in what he knows best and gives his fans what they wanted.Now, this movie comes across...kinda doucey...as its a typical teen type horror film, or so it seems at least. This movie is almost like black christmas which the remake totally sucked and it's also a bit like the craft or scream. All that together sounds like a movie I definitely don't want to watch, however, im here for the director. It could be a happy slappy kids movie and I still might watch it for the sake of seeing Barrett's work.That said, this movie turned out to be damn good. The editing is on point and the overall atmosphere is truly reminiscent of Barrett's previous work. This movie has a "You're Next" sort of feel but its a bit more crisp, yet less horrific. The box to the movie says it's "mysterious, macabre, and plenty bloody". Well the movie is definitely mysterious as well as macabre. While watching, i was wondering "wheres this plenty bloody stuff?" I wasn't so sure the movies kill scenes warranted the quote on the box. Most of the kills were off screen or barely seen...that is until the ending. Wowow this movie got crazily bloody in the last 15 minutes. It's similar to the way "You're Next" delivered a couple crazy kills right at the end of the movie, however, "You're Next" was fluent with the blood through out the film.Suki Waterhouse is also very attractive but she definitely doesn't look like a college student. She looks like shes around my age, 30, much older than her fellow classmates in the film...Man what I'd give to kiss that girl..Either way this is a success for Simon Barrett and im really excited to see his work in "V/H/S94""
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11188624/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Surprisingly good ","Just finished this one on Amazon Prime and I definitely didn't think it was a waste of time.Starts off as a supernatural mystery and then quickly turns into a slasher flick, which I thought worked well. I liked how everything unfolded in the end, especially with the story of the ghost haunting the dorm.Definitely a few surprises towards the end regarding the killers identity.Suki Waterhouse killed it in this movie, she was so awesome and a force to reckon with! It was a blast watching her put up a good fight against the killer at the end.Excellent one!!"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11188624/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","1"," Nothing new here. ","Well, we have a bunch of neurotic girls in an all female elite school.There is a hint that a ghost or someone is killing them one by one... But nothing interesting happens, not even the killings are interesting, they are all rated R-13.Not even some gratuitous nudity is show in this bore fest.The girls are as uninteresting as they can be, and the conclusion is a big meh!It is a slasher film for girls, but I suspect that not even girls you like it.It is good for insomnia, though."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11188624/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","2"," It's not like "The Craft" ","The plot of the movie is ok. The characters are so annoying and so badly written. The location is basic. I have noticed that many reviews and comments say that this movie is a "The Craft" wannabe. Eventually, it has nothing to do with "The Craft". It's more of a murder-mystery movie. In my opinion, the execution wasn't nice, most elements of the movie were basic and usual. Nothing innovative. Also, most of the kills were off-screen, which made the movie worse. Only the last 2 kills were so brutal and nice. Moreover, the killer's motives were so silly and they didn't make sense. Anyway, in my opinion the trailer makes you have high expectations about the movie, but, when you are finally watching the movie you realise that it's awful."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11188624/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," Actually found a good movie this year! ","Most, if not all new movies this year have just plain sucked, and believe me, I'm being nice. Saw this one in the new movies area of PlayStation and had to check it out. Really worth the watch. The location of the movie is a bit limited, but the story is good as well as the acting, plus I can relate to being a new kid in a new school from being an Army brat, getting moved every 4 years. It sucks.Anyway...it's a bit of a Scooby-doo/who done it kind of movie where the killer is revealed at the end. I enjoyed this one and it's definitely worth the watch. Peace."

The female lead looks pretty much a grad student, and that Asian Yvonne looks maybe 40?? Questionable casting or girls are in extended highschool?"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11188624/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," A Spooky Mean Girls Murder Mystery ","My review title pretty much sums up the movie so if that's not your thing, you probably won't like it.This was a very well done movie in pretty much all respects. The atmosphere was wonderful, the acting was okay, the story was decent and personally took me by complete surprise.The thing is, this is not my kind of movie. I don't know if it's aimed at my demographic, honestly, but it's also called "Seance" and it's not really a ghost story, which is what the title and trailer make you think it is, and is what I wanted to watch. I mean, it sort of is, but not enough of one to be called "Seance."Even though it wasn't really a ghost story, they did an excellent job making it look like one. I loved the spooky atmosphere. But the story and characters were infuriating to me. It's meant to be infuriating, the way Mean Girls is I guess, but I hate movies with bullies and clueless characters. The only reason I'm rating this a 5 and not lower is because I think it's unfair to rate it that low when I think a lot of people will like this - as long as they know what they're getting into. It is a horror story, but not one you'll expect from the title or trailer. For me, personally, this is a 4/10 because the story and characters were so unappealing to me. They didn't deliver what they advertised. I hate that. But the movie isn't a bad one. It's very well done."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11191344/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," A good way to revisit Thadam, albeit in a different language. ","I became a fan of Thadam as I watched it and every second of it had me intrigued, even if the setup took some time. And just having watched its official Telugu remake Red on Netflix with subtitles, I can assure you it has enough intensity to work on its own. Ram Pothineni's subtle performance is the main reason this remake doesn't turn out to be shoddy or plain predictable. Also, while a lot of negative response to the film can be attributed to the film's solely being a remake (and the commonly believed notion that remakes don't match up to the original), Red is also a good way to revisit Thadam, albeit in a different language and with a different cast.Ram, who is known for his colorful lighthearted entertainers, must be lauded for trying something different this time. A film which is high on dialogue and plot development is not easy to deliver without the fear of losing out on the casual fans of a star who's not usually known for such films, but the makers have done a splendid job with Red. It's pretty long and yet manages to mix suspense, drama, action and even some humor from time to time. The fight scenes, while not as intense as those in Thadam, are still very well choreographed and delivered with brilliance. The songs are pretty good, and the very first one that gives Ram's fans a dose of his "Ismartness" (Ismart Shankar reference; his previous blockbuster film) should be enough for the masses. The first half takes too long to get to the point (about 50 minutes until the "thriller element" comes into play), and this filler segment could've been cut short. I wish I could've said the same for Thadam, but that film handled those portions pretty well too, so no.Ram's casual fans might enjoy the initial first half for giving them the standard package of romance and music bits, but the latter bit of it is where the plot starts intensifying and those expecting this to be some regular masala ride can leave. Those who haven't seen Thadam can surely enjoy it as the writing is strong even here, and luckily, even as someone who has seen and loved Thadam, I was able to enjoy Red without getting bored. Even if the dialogue gets heavy, some little but subtle humor dilutes the tension and intense action scenes served from time to time, even if only as per plot demands, keep the tension coming. You may or may not share the same opinion as me, but Red is indeed a well made film, and that is visible from the visuals alone. It's a good neo-noir action thriller with beautiful, stylish frames as opposed to the gritty and grounded visuals of Thadam, and that alone should be enough to conclude the makers haven't just replicated the original scene-by-scene."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11191344/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," Didn't live up to the expectations ","I already saw Thadam but my friend still insisted to watch Red also as they made it more interesting. The movie was interesting but Ram acted poorly while playing the dual character as he was lifeless throughout the film. He couldn't match the energy and enthusiasm - Arun Vijay showed when playing this dual character in Thadam.Positives: The 3 main actresses did their job well. The screenplay and camera work was good."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11191344/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," 5 star and i am being very generous ","This story has more potholes than roads of India.Acting and camera work is good but story is very very poor.The final big suspense,you will see it coming from 1000 miles.Watch this film with least expectations it has nothing extraordinary."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11191344/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," Many boring parts ","There's soooo much lag. First half is a bore fest, second half is just ok. Definitely below avg movie. I didn't expect a thriller to be so boring man, kinda dissatisfied with that and the direction. Even the flash back scenes in the second half were a bit boring, and they could've just done a quick summary instead of wasting so much time on it. BGM and Ram were good, only reasons y I stayed throughout the movie. Or else I would've walked out, cause seriously it was that laggy and boring. That's what I think is the biggest problem of the movie, it only works in parts. There was sooo much potential but there's just too much lag..as a Ram fan, I wasn't too happy with this movie. Only reason this was a hit is because of pandaga time, and the long theatre gap. If this released in normal time, when movies didn't go on pause, easily below avg"
