"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11299422/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," When the Screaming Stops. ","After being dazzled from Dawn Breaks Behind the Eyes (2021-also reviewed) I decided to double bill it with a "First Blood" screening/stream at FrightFest. Picking one of the titles out of the section totally at random, I prepared for the screams to start.View on the film:Discussing in a interview after the screening/stream about all the various non-movie projects (stage shows, festivals etc) he and the cast/crew had done before this title, co-writer (with lead actor Ed Hartland) / director Conor Boru makes a excellent feature film debut which runs like a well-oiled machine, thanks to Boru & cinematographer Adrian Musto closely working with editor Alan Rae to pair every killer one-liner with a killer set-piece.Sitting in on the first "family" meeting with very funny match cuts from Rae, Boru refreshingly goes for a mock-doc, rather then Found Footage style, which allows for stylish whip-pans, zoom-ins and slow-motion catching each off the cuff funny one-liner each member makes.Whilst making this a humorous odd bunch, Boru impressively does not shy away from presenting their murderous ways in a brutal manner,with nail gun close-ups on the killings the cackling family commit, which unleashes a spray of gore which pours out until the screaming fades.Hoping to make a name for themselves as serial killers, the ensemble cast give gripping live-wire performances,with Ed Hartland dead-pan slicing into Mendle's anxiety about committing murder,whilst dreaming of becoming a famous serial killer, and Kave Niku hilariously steals every scene he is in as the out of the loop Masoud.Getting the family all together, the screenplay by Hartland and Boru displays real superb comedic skill by cleverly giving each member of the family their moment to shine with deadly one-liners, from creepy twins Viktoria and Veronika to burning hot sociopath Amy, who all make end their family meeting when the screaming starts."

Equally funny in highlighting the mundanities of everyday existence for the central anti hero and character clashes as the plot develops.The synopsis makes it sound like Man Bites Dog or Behind The Mask but this flick is savvy in avoiding aping superficially similar productions and carving it's own path.What's particularly impressive is how the performances and thoughtful editing ensure the film maintains its energy through the final act as the story moves away from humour and into grim irony.Highly recommended."

A one night stand between them throws not only their worlds into chaos but, their friends lives as well. It doesn't have a story-book ending but, there is truth in that.THE NEGATIVES: Bad casting choices. 30 to 40 something actors as college students just starting to experience life. Mixing 20, 30 and 40 somethings as a tight knit group of friends-in college. A laser focused / tunnel vision aspect to the scenes in public places. By that I mean the background actors could have been replaced with cardboard cut-outs.Things that just didn't work: A business major that doesn't understand statistics. A college, never pictured, devoid of other people. The drinking at work scenes for both leads. The two businesses are lacking customers and allow on the job drinking. The dialog for the first half of the movie is as subtle as a chainsaw.To the author: You told a realistic story and did it well. The emotional subtext comes through in your your work.

[+48%] ","Irreverent comedy might still be relatively new for the Telugu audience but having grown up on a steady dose of it in Malayalam (thanks to all those Priyadarshan flicks), I didn't feel blown away (like many others) by Jathi Ratnalu. As you'd expect, the storyline is an excuse for a series of nonsensical gags, most of which didn't work for me. Except for Naveen Polishetty (who's a natural) and Murali Sharma (who at least tries), the rest of the ensemble, including the sidekicks, fail to leave an impression. I'd have rated this two stars, but the court scene at the end (and everything around "Hong Kong") made me guffaw comparatively more. The pacing, the one-too-many subplots that don't add up, and the bizarre editing (and continuity) are definite downers."

Led by Srikanth, who convinces his father to give him two months to make something of his life, the three make it to Hyderabad. But instead of landing jobs, they find themselves embroiled in a murky political controversy, which involves corrupt ministers, a cell phone with an incriminating video and bribes of hundreds of crores.

The film makers seemed struggling to make the film end and abruptly opted to paint all the characters including antagonists, judge as jokers.So much potential was wasted.

V., follows Srikanth (Naveen Polishetty), Ravi (Rahul Ramakrishna), and Shekhar (Priyadarshi) as they try to escape the confines of their small town and make it big in Hyderabad. But just when things start to look up, the political plot running parallel to them crosses their path and runs them over, thereby leaving them to fend for themselves and prove their innocence. The trio's chemistry is used to the maximum to elicit laughter throughout its heavy 145-minute long runtime. And despite having some pacing issues, it manages to be a rib-tickling viewing experience and also get its point about class divide across.The whole notion that in order to enjoy Indian blockbuster-level comedies, people should keep their brains at home is a weird excuse to avoid facing any criticism. Because if you say that you didn't enjoy any of it or didn't laugh at any of its jokes, the makers can just say that you were using your brain too much. Whereas the fact is that the makers themselves forgot to use their brains while writing the movie. See, I am not saying that there is a sub-genre in comedy that is nonsensical in nature. I am saying that despite being nonsensical, it should be first and foremost entertaining to its very core. Imagine sitting in a theatre or on your couch and spending even 1 hour of your life watching a comedy and not laughing even once. Jathi Ratnalu does have some few gags which work but are just like "Goose pimples".The only thing works is the genuineness of actors and characters. From Naveen Polishetty (watched him since AIB days), Priyadarshi, Rahul Ramakrishna, Faria Abdullah, Murli Sharma, Brahmanandam, Vennela Kishore, Brahmaji, V. K. Naresh, Tanikella Bharani, Giri Babu, Subhalekha Sudhakar, Mirchi Kiran, Divya Sripada, Mahesh Achanta, and more, along with a cameo by Vijay Deverakonda and Keerthy Suresh.Music is almost unheard (no literally).Intact writing and direction would have made a complete package.This is a long movie and has some pacing issues.

If you are looking to laugh and enjoy yourself and think you can get most of the jokes then you are going to love it. I quite love and appreciate the fact that at no point does the movie take itself seriously and neither is the viewer supposed to. The jokes are clever, not all of them are good but where they land, they will have you rolling on the floor laughing.This movie is a satire on how everything is becoming weird these days - right is wrong and wrong is right. When there is a murder attempt on a 'corrupt' politician's life, three friends from a small village who are struggling to make it in the big city become the prime suspects. (The plot isn't important btw). In their search for evidence to prove their innocence some downright hilarious shenanigans ensue. The end is the least of the what you would expect. Instead of a hard hitting message, the movie replaces it with inane dialog that has the desired effect as is the case in today's day and age.The trio's innocence is proven in the most silliest of ways imaginable and that there is the beauty of this movie.DO not miss it for anything.

About 70 minutes of the film is just pure laughter. About 30 minutes of the film is cringy jokes. And the rest of movie is just to build a story. So to give a review of this film I have to split it into 3 parts.First 30 minutes: From a movie that was only inspired to make comedy without a story, contrastingly the first 30 minutes will seem like it doesn't have enough comedy. The minimal jokes that were there were funny but there were too less to keep the interest high. You must have heard that this movie is one of the biggest blockbusters this year and the good reviews might doubt you. Luckily the next 60 minutes will be 100 times more funny.30 minute mark to court scenes: This part is absolutely the funniest thing ever. You will laugh continuously here and most of the jokes are not cringy at all here. The story is also very engaging here so you won't be like the movie is made just for comedy. The total contrast from the first 30 minutes will make you relax and say it is a blockbuster. The comedy will 100% exceed you expectations and the thing that will amaze you is how they got the comedy. They make a joke out of the most unexpected thign ever. They make comedy out of everything from the sound of a rice cooker whistle to eating tomatoes.After court scenes: This part is also extremely funny but you might find a lot of jokes quite cringy. The story goes all over the place and doesn't really make sense. Compared to the 1st half this part's story is a bit bad and jokes don't boom that well. The whole court scenes become a total cringe and somehow the director turns the whole thing to china and hong kong noodles. Overall this part delivers a fun ending that we all wanted.Scale to compare9.0/10 Mahanati, 8.0/10 Bahubali 2, 7.0/10 Ala Vaikunta puramu lo, 6.0/10 JATHIRATNALU, 5.0/10 Sashi (2021), 4.0/10 Agnyathavasi."

I found the storyline is weak. The plot goes here and there without any proper direction. But the acting and other things are good. Naveen tried his best, but again the story was not strong enough. Comedy was there, but again, not like you will burst into laughter. Overall, it's okay."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11306488/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Too many loopholes but the BGM is good ","Overall a nice thriller. The underwhelming aspects are the actors and their acting. Sumanth probably forgot how to act. Nassar according to me was the only saving grace in the movie. There are certain gaps for eg. Sumanth never carried a file when he first went to meet nassar but when he wakes up from at nassar's home the file is on the table.BGM was good. Probably tried to emulate Ratsasan's music. Heroine is not there in the movie. The story can be trimmed a bit. Has only one song in the movie, which was a welcome in such sort of thrillers."

Having said that, I think some of the low scores actually speak of the quality of the movie in general and the lead performance specifically. You are not supposed to like the kid ... you really are not. You are not even really supposed to understand him. He doesn't understand himself. He is looking for something ... will he find it? Now that is the main course ... there is a side dish .. something that you may not understand or unable to connect to the main theme/story/arc.That is sort of on purpose. I say sort of, because you can see a connection - but it is left up to you to decide if it actually means something. I would argue that it does ... but it also leaves a lot of things open ... you won't find too many answers here. Which to get back to my original point is frustrating - and therefor I reckon I understand the low rating overall.The actors are really good and the pacing may be slow, but really works like a charm here. Remember the fact you do not understand and do not like the main character, does not mean the movie is bad ... of course it is understandable, if that means you just don't like it ..."

Why would anyone be surprised that the actions of a teenager make no logical sense? Thirteen year old John (an excellent Charlie Shotwell, CAPTAIN FANTASTIC, 2014) comes across as a shy kid, and a curious one as well. He's a talented tennis player, enjoys going head-to-head in video games with his online friend, and even plays piano. Despite his upper class family life, we sense there is something a bit off about John - although his busy parents are supportive and his banter with his older sister is pretty normal. But his emotionless demeanor sends our mind to dark, uncertain places ... places we hope John doesn't go, although we kind of expect him to.This is the first feature film directed by Pascual Sisto, and the script comes from Oscar winner Nicolas Giacobone (BIRDMAN, 2014). You should know it's not the typical narrative arc. One day John, with the help of his shiny new drone, locates a long-forgotten unfinished bunker in the nearby woods. The next thing we know, John has drugged his family and dumped them in that hole. That's not a spoiler, as it's shown in the trailer. When Mom (Jennifer Ehle, SAINT MAUD, 2020), Dad (Michael C Hall, "Dexter"), and sis (Taissa Farmiga, "American Horror Story") awaken in the mucky pit, they are frightened and confused. When John appears to deliver food and blankets, he offers nothing in the way of an explanation.As movie watchers, we have been conditioned to expect this type of situation will lead to significant violence. Instead, we watch as John steps into his newfound freedom. His image of adulting is what he's observed from his parents: classical music, wine, cooking, milking the ATM, and driving the car. He has bypassed the coming-of-age stage, passed "go", and moved directly into his version of adulthood. We know this can't end well, but John is thirteen and isn't mature enough, regardless of this manufactured freedom, to plan ahead.This is a wealthy family living in a glass house ... an unmistakable metaphor. A sense of entitlement and pursuit of money has distracted the parents from focusing on the importance of teenage years. Whether they realize this looking up at him from the bunker is debatable. John's story is told by a mother to her daughter, an unusual sequence that acts as an awkward framing device. Cinematographer Paul Ozgur delivers terrific camera work with the house, the bunker in the woods, and John's odd demeanor. This is an unsettling film that is more psychological drama than thriller or character study. It clearly borrows from two masters, Michael Haneke and Yorgos Lanthimos, but falls short of their best work (as you'd expect). Still, the film has a certain style, and reminds us that the moral to the story of a teenager's actions often boils down to "don't do that".Opens in select theaters and On Demand August 6, 2021."

","If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)This edition of Sundance has already delivered a few ambiguous, atmospheric films (Human Factors, In The Earth), but none has surprised or impacted me in a positive way so far. John and the Hole comes close to get a good reaction from me, but it also holds another massive bunker filled with way too many open questions. It's always challenging to review a movie with an underlying, vague story that I don't fully understand. In all honesty, there's an entire storyline I'm either just scratching the surface of something greater, or it's indeed an underwhelming, insignificant part of the screenplay. Since I can't put my finger on what it's truly about, I'm going to ignore it for now and come back later in a second viewing.Nevertheless, almost the whole film deals with something (apparently) separated from the subplot above. This is where the movie fails to deliver a more captivating narrative. Nicols Giacobone's screenplay is packed with intriguing premises and setups, but its respective developments and outcomes are far from extraordinary or surprising. Throughout the entire runtime, I'm waiting for a major energy burst or an impactful event, but these rarely arrive. The viewer follows Charlie Shotwell's character as the young kid finds himself responsible for everything in his life, but despite the admittedly suspenseful atmosphere keeping me at the edge of my seat (couch), I still hoped for something more substantial to occur.Michael C. Hall, Jennifer Ehle, and Taissa Farmiga are formidable, transforming a small bunker into the most interesting place in the film due to their fascinating interactions. Seeing their characters trying to stay sane proved to be surprisingly entertaining. However, Shotwell steals the spotlight as expected from such a protagonist-centered narrative. Outstanding performance. Technically, Paul zgr's cinematography offers some memorable shots that elevate a few particular sequences, but it's Caterina Barbieri's unique score that really generates the tense environment, which kept me curious until the very end.Pascual Sisto's direction also deserves praise, but until I see his movie a second or even third time, I don't believe it's fair for me to criticize a film I don't wholly understand for leaving so many questions unanswered. Still, I believe there's a forced attempt at being entirely ambiguous instead of balancing this aspect with more straightforward elements.John and the Hole is yet another ambiguous entry in this year's edition of Sundance, but this time, it actually comes close to satisfy me. Ignoring a particular storyline that I don't fully understand yet (second viewing required), Pascual Sisto's direction and Nicols Giacobone's screenplay leave too many pending questions to my taste, but I can't deny some of them generate quite an interesting debate within myself. Either I'm just scratching the surface of something greater, or the underwhelming, uneventful, basic developments of intriguing situations are nothing more than exactly that. The phenomenal performances from everyone involved (and I genuinely mean everyone), the exquisite camera work, and the addictive score all add to the incredibly suspenseful atmosphere that kept me invested until the very last second. Still, that ending... I don't know.Rating: B-"

From my knowledge this was one of the most anticipated Sundance entries this year, and my most anticipated. I will say that I'm not disappointed. This is an experience; one that will either click with you or just be too much. Oscar-winner Nicols Giacobone writes a great screenplay with such natural and unsettling dialogue. The comedic tone landed well with me, but I just really like a dark comedy. John is my favorite part of the whole thing. His character is so far from normalcy, but I felt a connection with him throughout. He's struggling with the concept of adulthood and responsibility that he resorts to a sociopathic nature. I loved the acting from everyone. A family that is so far from being close feels close in these strange times. At the end of the first act we're introduced to a new character and storyline that does feel a little off. I understand where it's going, but it wasn't exactly needed. I still didn't have a huge issue with it. This is definitely a slow burn, especially in the second half of it. At some points it feels like it doesn't have a structure, and that's fine with me. The absurdness just makes the watch more interesting. The cinematography is great, the score is really fitting, and the hole feels like a second home after a little bit. Not everyone is going to like Pascual Sisto's direction and what this film has to say. To me it has strong A24 vibes that will gain a cult following. Go and watch John and the Hole upon its release."

He has this dumb irritating look on his face that makes you wanna back hand him. What was the point of this movie? And what was up with that horrible ending. This kid literally dumps his family into a hole for a week and faced no consequences. Life just went back to normal. I would of put that little weirdo in a mental hospital."

It was well acted, interesting, great cinematography, interesting story idea and crap ending as far as I'm concerned. Sadly, society is breeding more and more of these soul less VOIDs that look like children, but there must be a POD in the back yard where something alien made this Creepy, empty, inhuman copy left with this family. And in this case, I totally do not get what was supposed to be his end game. His family are nice, educated and caring people, he wants for nothing and if some answers had come I could have rated this higher. I can't say more without spoilers, but I'm Pissed off. I've met kids like this and see more and more of them with each passing year and it frightens me. But that ending??? Seriously, Come on.. just Ridiculous and Senseless. Worth a one time watch if you don't mind being disappointed at the end and left with 1,000 questions and feeling Pissed off. Or if your a soul less human Void too, then you may enjoy this. But if your a caring person with a heart, this movie will leave you feeling angry and dumbfounded."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11307724/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","1"," A movie without a spine ","When I saw what a great cast this movie has I could not understand how it received such low ratings and then I watched the entire thing. There wasn't a boomer within the entire production as the values the movie portrays are new and part of the woke world. There's a 13 year-old boy who puts his family in a deep bunker. No reason is ever given why a spoiled child would do this. He starves his family while spending the parents money, driving the car and making a general mess. The kid is a sociopath without the slightest doubt but the parents promise to do nothing if only the kid would let them out. Maybe the filmmakers were trying to portray evil but instead one feels it is the filmmakers who are evil and the cast are idiots for reading those lines. These people only care how they look to the outside world and care not to even look at the problems within the family. In the end, I felt the parents deserved what they got and I wouldn't feel empathy for them if their kid grows into a full blown serial killer and then kills the family. This type of people, the world can do without. I can forgive the cast for taking these roles because there is so little content of substance anymore."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11307724/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","1"," Vapid vignettes in search of a movie ","I hate doling out 1/10 because it's generally kind of childish, but I have to here because I would actively tell people to avoid this one.This isn't really a movie in the traditional sense. It's an allegory trying to convey or explore the experience becoming an adult. As the premise states a sociopathic or perhaps overly coddled rich kid dumps his family in a hole for the purpose of exploring the freedom of adulthood.That's fine, but there's no real payoff here, nothing is learned in any meaningful way. It, almost insultingly, includes a side story which also doesn't payoff, but instead vapidly goes "look look isn't adulthood scary!?"Yes it's scary. Duh. The problem here is there's nothing after it throws the allegory in the audiences face. I can't help but feel the writer had a half-baked idea and couldn't come up with the punchline. Instead the movie meanders along with drawn out scenes of people eating and robot dialog until it ends out of sheer boredom.This one is strictly for those that can enjoy films that are pure atmosphere and do not need substance."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11307724/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Quarter baked, but worth it ","1) Great cinematography to bring out the bizarre vibes. Borrows a plot from the Greek weird wave.2) Its a largely subdued plot but since I haven't figured out what the alternate story line meant, Id say I was intrigued throughout.3) Great cast all around. I don't really care for "its boring/slow...." crowd here because that's highly subjective."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11307724/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," A metaphoric uneasy watch. ","Taking cues from Lanthimo's stylistically, comes a dark coming of age cult film that will either stimulate the senses, intrigue with it's deeply metaphoric story or glaze over the eyes of the disinterested. Symbolism of "how and why" exist while it's ambiguity shrouds clear explanation. The sub-story makes sense as John wanted to role play his way into "adulting", while the adult in the sub-story, wants nothing to do with the responsibilities of being an adult in the most ridiculously and illogical of ways. It's loaded with pitch dark satire and tonal cinematography, and for me, that can only bring the inevitable comparison to Lorgo's style. This is a very uniquely challenging viewing---a slow burn that delivers in my opinion, and not just delivers a troubled kid growing up story, but why, how and shows also, there are no guarantees when having children. John is not only isolated (while living with his family), he comes across as on the spectrum with uniquely dark and odd questions to adults and his parents, and acts out on some, that they cannot satisfactorily answer---further showing the divide.Caterina Barbieri's score (who is one my fave experimental electronic artists) encapsulates the moodiness of this unique experience perfectly, which was an unexpected bonus."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11307724/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," My shot at an unpretentious explanation ","These glowing reviews are written by a buncha people who sniff their own farts and love it. They're more concerned with trying to look cultured than being honest. Well I think I have a pretty good read on this movie myself...and it's still not that great. There's not much dialogue or story here, it really is some kid that traps his family in a hole, but there is a meaning to it. At least I think there is.So you have this kid John. He's quiet and shows basically no emotion or interest in really connecting with anyone, including his own family. He's prone to either just saying "Okay" or "Why" in response to instruction. So it's easy to think that the kid is either just a jerk, on the spectrum, or soulless. But I think what he's symbolizing what it's like to be a child on the verge of young adulthood while understanding next to nothing about the world. Growing up we're given instructions and told to do things simply because it's "normal" or "what people do". You ask why and are told to stop asking questions and just do it. Many people are fine with this, they grow up to be adults who are great at being told what to do without the need to think for themselves. As a kid who irritated everyone by asking "Why?" constantly I actually understand John.So my belief is that as a way to communicate this to his parents, because he clearly can't use words properly, he puts them in the position he sees himself in. He puts them in a hole where they're constantly asking him to talk to them, to tell them "why?", why are they in the hole, why doesn't he just answer? That is John's perspective of the world, trapped in a hole that no one will explain to him.Now here's why it's not that good of a movie. For one, no it's not a dark comedy whatsoever, that's nonsense. It's also not a thriller. It IS psychological, but so slow and with no exposition at all it leaves too many questions. There is a plot point that touches on John trying to drown himself a few times to see what's there at the verge of death. It's just him floating face down in a pool, nothing else happens, but when he does let his family out of the hole they come across him face down in a pond and panic in a rush to save him. I think this made a connection as to the "why" in John's mind...that even after what he did they still loved him and wanted him to live. So I suppose that's a reason to continue on into adulthood. But who can be sure, it's not explained. There is also a completely random plot point of a mother talking to her young daughter about things like needing to abandon her and then the movie ends with scenes of the young daughter wandering around the woods alone. No clue who they were or what that was about, I definitely didn't understand that.So I think I might have understood parts of this movie, but it was really boring and I wouldn't watch it again. Not the absolute worst but it definitely isn't anything above maybe a 5-6 depending on the individual. These people acting like it's art house magic are hacks."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11307724/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," This is a slow slow burner of what in the actual F ","A slow burner of a film with no fizzle or boom to speak of. Just leaves you pondering what would you do in this ultimate extreme example of childhood sociopaths and their dynamic with their nuclear family when a very bad "episode or mental break" occurs. None of this is explained. You sorta had to come to this conclusion yourself through the natural order and progression of the film. What baffles me is there was a Mother and Daughter story-line as well. One that has absolutely nothing to do with the 1st families story and is just as bat-shi# crazy and unexplained. 2nd bat shi# crazy story not-withstanding -- the movie was really weird with a touch of possible macabre realism.

But my intrigue never payed off.I won't spoil anything because there isn't anything to spoil. There are no revelations, twists, or anything of the sort.

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11307724/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," An oblique attempt at parable or allegory with too much room for interpretation for most viewers ","I'm all for films that make the viewer think and draw their own conclusions or apply whatever the story is trying to say to their own interpretations of life and the world. This is a Haneke-esque parable consisting of two parallel but inverted storylines, one of which obviously consumes the majority of the run-time (hint: the one in the title).Ahhhkay....so here we go. This one has excellent production value, a pretty decent cast (Dexter lol!), and good direction and cinematography. I really appreciated the soundtrack/score as this type of modern synth creepiness is often way overdone, but not in "John and the Hole."Sorry to those who totally panned it with 1-Star reviews because "nobody would let their kid do that, he'd be in therapy" or "the ending made no sense" It's just not possible to draw those conclusions from this movie if you know anyone with kids that age in, well, this day and age - or if you remember being that age yourself. Perhaps that's one of the film's lessons anyway - Maybe parents *should* be more keenly observant of behaviors such as John's. Clearly this was a family of means, and they - unlike the vast majority of Americans - could afford psychotherapy or medical observation of their son. But sessions cost anywhere from $100-$300/hr and aren't covered by most insurance, IF you're lucky enough to have insurance in this country. But that's also part of the film's point and perspective: that of upper-middle class bourgeoise detachment from the real worries and experiences of life.Sorry to get bogged down in that. On with the review...I'm glad I didn't have to shell out the dough for a theater experience (including drinks, popcorn, parking, etc.) to see this film. In fact I'm not even sure what format its theatrical release happens to be ("art house", major chain, small release, etc.) but I can tell you that it belongs in "art house" theaters. It's just too oblique for many viewers.Overall, I appreciated it and found "John and the Hole" thought-provoking and scary at the same time. It wasn't intended to be "realistic" in terms of real world potentialities, actions or outcomes. It was a vague dive into the mentality of modern juveniles and what exactly defines "adulthood." For that reason, and that I wasn't ever tempted to get up or turn it off, I give it 6 Stars. Just know you're not signing up for a typical movie viewing experience and keep your expectations low. On the other hand, if you're a fan of "art house" cinema, you'll probably find many aspects of this film enjoyable as I did.As for the ending, since so many seem to be completely unable to free themselves from their own frame of reference (see: the same people who reflexively give Haneke movies terrible reviews because they don't take the time to digest them in the context of contemporary American cinema), I feel compelled to defend it here. This wasn't supposed to be a realistic outcome; it was intended to be absurd, as was the rest of the film. That it's hidden behind a veil of upper middle class normalcy, excellent film-making and a languid, sometimes boring story arc is exactly the point of the exercise. It's also demonstrated in the parallel story that attempts to frame the ridiculousness of the main plot, at least from the point of view of an adult with a well-formed intellect and in-check id. In that sense it's a fantasy of adolescence in which "adulthood" consists only of going through a few boring and repetitive motions every day with no real moral , ethical or well-defined desired outcome - and - in the modern bourgeoise existence, little to no consequence to the outcome of those motions."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11307724/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," An ambitiously original psychological thriller ","Visual artist Pasquale Sisto steps behind the camera for his first feature along with an exceptional cast. The compact team playing the wealthy family facing a unique crisis consists of Charlie Shotwell, Michael C Hall, Jennifer Ehle, and Taissa Farmiga.With a stoic glare, John (Charlie Shotwell ) attends tennis lessons, practices piano, and has one friend mainly existing only online. He's completely disconnected spending the majority of his life alone. One day while out exploring with his drone he stumbles upon an underground bunker.Later that night, John drugs his family and transports their sleeping bodies into the deep bunker where they're unable to escape. With his newfound freedom the 13 year old takes his father's car out for a joyride and checks their back account. After noticing a balance just shy of a million dollars, he purchases a bigger TV for himself. Before inviting his only friend over, John continues tennis and piano lessons while beginning to role play being an adult.With a screenplay by Oscar winner Nicols Giacobone themes of isolation, skewering upper class, and the toxic effects of individualism are fully realized. In particular money is constantly displayed as a central theme of adult relationships. A subplot with the one of my favorite underused actors Georgia Lyman is intentionally confusing but important nonetheless.Sisto and Director of Photography Paul Ozgur shoot in a tight 4:3 aspect ratio. Through the use of long lenses they frame the large house and surrounding woods in a surveilled perspective that feels claustrophobic. While the vision and story are original, I kept thinking of Michael Haneke's "Cache" and "Funny Games". Both of those films involve bourgeois couples in disturbing situations while the films maintain a clinical evaluation of history and society. Just like his stories "John and the Hole" is reminder that the past never stays buried."

Try to forget this false note, because the rest in pretty good. Something reminds me Peter Collinson's OPEN SEASON. In this 1974 movie the human hunters realize that the man who tracks them down is no one else than their long time neighbor, only at the end. Here, you have nearly the same scheme. I guess that's a kind of tribute to Collinson's feature. Or a coincidence."

If that's not entertaining when you watch a mystery/thriller than what is? I like the element of surprise, an end you don't see coming, that's what it's all about if you're into this genre. The cinematography was good, the acting as well, and even if the story contains some stupid decisions from the main characters you can't deny the twists were great and unpredictable.

There's further news to celebrate shortly after when she announces her pregnancy, although tensions appear to have surfaced in their relationship. To smooth over the cracks, they take a trip away together to the icy plains of Sweden, but encounter some hostility on the way by some people who appear aggrieved by their mixed race partnership, and before long find themselves stalked by an unseen enemy. But the real reason behind it emerges from a dark secret from their past they thought was behind them.The use of the 'real time' formula, condensing events in a thriller to a compact, half hour timeframe to create the effect of actually being caught up in events as they're going on, is an effective method that can work multiple times, with successful results. Director Alain Dorborg gives it a spin again with this Swedish effort. European cinema has a tendency to pull it off much more elegantly than Hollywood's bolshy style, but sadly I can think of better examples from there than what's on offer here.The real time element aside, Dorborg's film borrows heavily from many other films before it, such as Dead Calm, Open Water, Southern Comfort, Breakdown and films of that like, and although it manages to create an atmosphere and style all of its own, their influence is always there in the background. It touches on deeper societal issues, like people's attitudes and reactions to mixed race partnerships, which adds a little more depth to things, but it's rounded off with a surprise twist ending that offers little in the way of foreshadowing, and leaves the viewer a little short changed, despite its heavy impact.Its a mixed bag of results, really, admirable for what it gets right, but its flaws make their presence felt. ***"

","Red Dot is an international Swedish film written and directed by Alain Darborg, in his second full length feature film, with only a handful of shorts and TV episodes under his belt. His directing was on point, with excellent use of the landscape and sets.The story we've seen before, and up until the last 20 mins or so, I was getting a little frustrated and bored that this film wasn't going anywhere. Then all of a sudden the film comes up with some nice twists and turns, and that made it different from the typical survival films. Also up until that point, the pacing felt slow, so the normally decent 86 min runtime felt longer. I would've liked the last 20 minutes extended more into the latter part of the story. There were a few plot and technical issues, and some questionable (no spoiler) "why wouldn't they pick it up" moments, but overall, the story was very fluid and cohesive. The ending will certainly shake things up for the viewer.The cinematography was excellent, as was the score. There are a few "wtf" gore moments, but without those, the film may have felt stale. Casting and performances were actually really good as well. For an international low-budget non-Hollywood-ish-blockbuster type film, it's certainly deserving of my 7/10. All those wannabe critics with their 1's and 2's need to give their heads a shake, and learn how to review a film properly, and realize there's a scale from 1-10, not 1 or 10.

They should click on my username to see more of my 1000+ reviews, and read up on how to properly rate a film in my bio.

A young couple takes a skiing trip, in hopes to rekindle there love for each other, but things start to take a dangerous turn, has it becomes a fight for survival, has there being hunted by an unknown sniper. The suspenceful moments are pretty good, the acting is also good. Not everything is what it seems has the film goes on, you'll be real shocked when you learn the reason why the couple is being hunted. A pretty good thriller, if you are in the mood for a good thriller then give Red Dot a look."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11307814/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","1"," Steaming pile of dog poo ","Wholly unoriginal and predictable. The screenwriters should be ashamed of how terribly lazy they put this together. I have seen some fantastic Swedish films in my life. But holy cow, is this bad even for a undergrad freshman writer. The writers did not add a plot twist because that requires creative planning that leave clues in the first half of the story that would be referenced in the second half during the reveal. But not so fast here , because the writers lazily don't even bother with that. Instead, they make up an entirely different scenario, record short clips of scenes with the three actors that never happen in the main story. That's not how is suppose to work in writing. If it worked that way, anyone with the capability of holding a pen to paper would be a genus 2nd coming of William Shakespeare.But go watch the film. When you feel you wasted an evening on this d_g s__t, just remember the dismissive reviewers who gave it a 10 and told you to ignore everyone else who tried to give you a heads-up FYI and encouraged you to watch it."

It may seem a little fresh at the beginning, but sadly it becomes so formulaic, it's annoying. Second, the plot only gets worse and worse, no more logic, common sense, there are things that happen on screen in order to keep the movie going towards a comedic place. And last but not least, the final act is just so....overused. It was difficult to get through it really.There are some good things to Red Dot, I liked the surroundings, the cold, the wind, but this is about it. Some nature eye candy and nothing more.All in all it is very hard to talk too much about it without spoiling the movie, I will give it an extra point for the fact that it didn't rely on gore or torture porn. It was refreshing seeing otherwise.Red Dot is not one that I would recommend. Nothing really great here, nothing new and nothing interesting overall.Cheers!"

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11307814/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Thrilling But Not Quite There ",""I thought we'd escape a while, spend some time together."I thought I'd throw this one on while staying up for the new WandaVision episode the other night. The trailer for Red Dot showed up a couple times and it did look intriguing. When Nadja becomes pregnant, she and her husband make an attempt to rekindle their relationship by traveling to the north of Sweden for a hiking trip but soon their romantic trip turns into a nightmare. What started as more of a casual watch turned into something totally different. At first, I thought it was fine. Some actions felt a little too forced to have consequences. Anyway, I still had something to watch. Once the red dot comes on screen we're taken from a level 1 to a 10. I mean the intensity became almost overbearing. The movie's second act is absolutely thrilling. Sure, we've seen stuff like this in the past, but it handles it very well. It genuinely made me think about who might be hunting them down. We're given a scenario that has consequences and based off that we're assumed to believe that is the cause of this all. Obviously since the intensity is risen so much, we know there's more to the story. This thrill of a ride gives as two good performances.Every mystery, thriller, and horror movie must land the ending. If not, that affects the movie experience. The second act began to slow down and avert my attention from the story. In the third act, it goes for a big twist. For me, it got too convoluted. The twist the chose had to setup a whole new thing that we didn't know about which lost focused on most everything. It got me thinking that some of this should've been discussed in the first act. After all, it was sort of bland in the beginning. Once it got past the twist, it went back to full out. I liked what it was trying to say, but it couldn't find the right way to do it. What it lacks in story, it certainly makes up for the thrills. Technically speaking, the cinematography, score, and editing help make it interesting for the audience. I can't say I didn't like Red Dot, but it definitely needed some work. For what it is, it's halfway there."

On their way, they stop at a gas station and meet some annoying Swedish rednecks who smell of trouble. On their way out of the gas station, the young couple accidentally hit the front fender of the Swedish redneck's truck.I immediately thought that these guys would mean trouble later on but the movie gives as a huge twist near the end.

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11314148/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," An Ullu App Product mistakenly dumped on Hotstar. Shiddat deserves slaughtering, not normally but Shiddat se.. ","Shiddat (2021) : Movie Review -Shiddat gave negative Vibes from the trailer only so i wasn't really expecting it to be even an average affair. Well, I was expecting a below average film or a headache but not this MESS. The film is such a mess created by mixing multiple storylines of different different movies that it doesn't hold anything for its own identity. To be specific and sarcastic at the same time to describe it, i would say DDLJ + Love Aaj Kal + Jagame Thadiram + Laila Majnu + Argo = Shiddat. I hope, i have made it much clear now.Shiddat is about a passion of love and even its title refers the same but unfortunately it's more curved towards sexual appeal, immature love statements made by undisciplined youth and weak bond held between relationship. Mohit Raina plays Gautam who is in love with Ira played by Diana Penty and they get married. In wedding reception speech he talks about passionate love and a gatecrasher named Jaggi (Sunny Kaushal) finds it touching. Jaggi meets a gorgeous girl Kartika (Radhika Madan) and both have an intimate affair. Things looked quite funny till here then we get to know that Kartika is already engaged with someone and moving to London for the wedding. Jaggi confronts Kartika about this and she calls it a platonic affair and asks him to wait 3 months and to come to London if he really loves him.The story is told with the reference of DDLJ but the only difference here is that the true love feeling is missing. As expected Jaggi gets involved in an illegal immigration scam where he meets his saviour Gautam, who, now is separated from Ira. The Fiasco gets even more messy as we get involved into multiple storylines at the same time. What happens in the climax? Let's not reveal it here as i don't want to give away spoilers. Who knows you might like it.Performances of Sunny Kaushal and Mohit Raina are good. Sunny is definitely a promising young talent and this is the second time i am saying this after Forgotten Army. Diana Penty is decent whereas Radhika seems up and down after a while. Dialogues are senseless, cheap and too vulgar sometimes. Even forwarded adults jokes on whatsapp or immature teenagers' conversations are more funnier than this. The writing is definitely problematic as it tries to glamourise immortal love sagas from old days with modern definitions of love. It fails flat, completely annoying and unbearable. And it takes so long to end it, i mean one can get bored like hell. Kunal Deshmukh as director fails to leave an impact but thankfully his framework doesn't go to B Grade level as we saw in recent crap movies. Overall, another bad film from Bollywood and another wrong choice by Hotstar. Skip it.. Shiddat se..RATING - 4/10*"

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11314148/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Passionate Love Story ","Review By Kamal KIt's love at first sight for Jaggi (Sunny Kaushal) when he sees Kartika (Radhika Madan) coming out of the swimming pool. But sparks don't fly instantly, as an elaborate 'nafrat pyaar ki pehli seedi hai' kinda process follows, with Jaggi trying every trick in the book to woo the girl. There's some fun to be had here, as director Kunal Deshmukh transports us to the 90's brand of cinema that's played out in the modern setting.As a passionate love story, 'Shiddat' is driven purely from the perspective of its male protagonist Jaggi, whose manic obsession is given enough time to build. The entire first half is light and breezy with campus romance, flirting and a lot of naach gaana, basically everything but academics. What works here is the unpredictability factor, as you wonder what will become of this improbable love story.There aren't many characters in 'Shiddat',' which is refreshing, but their individual arcs could have been more sharply defined. There is little conviction in Mohit Raina and Diana Penty's story that seems to exist merely to aid the central storyline, which is fine, but it doesn't feel organic. Sunny Kaushal has the hardest time playing a bouncy lover-boy with serious boundary issues and while the actor gives it his best to make it convincing, his character graph starts becoming too hard to believe. Radhika Madan struggles to portray Kartika's inner conflict effectively on screen, mostly, resorting to fumbling to convey her anxiety. Mohit Raina is well cast as Gautam, the upright Indian immigration lawyer in a foreign land. Diana Penty looks gorgeous as the independent young Ira, but her character could have been developed more effectively. For a love story, 'Shiddat' has above average music (Sachin-Jigar) that grows on you and is effectively used to enhance the narrative. With rich cinematography (by Amalendu Chaudhary), the film shows visual finesse.The major problem with 'Shiddat' is that it's an exciting idea on paper that tends to drag in execution, especially in the second half. The story is highly unrealistic at times and preposterous too, but what keeps it going is the sense of volatility and suspense. However, it's true that in today's world of realistic cinema, we often don't get to see completely mad, raw and defiant love stories. This one goes there with Shiddat, but doesn't leave you deeply moved."

"," Shiddat, On DisneyPlus Hotstar, Is Old School And Not In A Good Way ","Radhika Madan and Sunny Kaushal are eminently watchable actors. Both combine a natural ease with inherent charm. Neither come with that specific designed-to-the gills polish that too many Bollywood newbies substitute for talent. Instead, both have an endearing relatability and most importantly, both can act.None of which is enough to save Shiddat, a bewilderingly logic-free film about a man obsessed with a woman. Shiddat means passion. It is what Jaggi, a center forward for the Punjab Hockey Team, feels for Kartika, a national-level swimmer. They meet at a sporting event - he and his friends go to the pool to letch at the female swimmers who they refer to as jalparis in nikke nikke kapde. Jaggi has his friend take Kartika's photo without her permission. He then posts it. She responds by marching into the boys' locker room and photographing them in various stages of undress. Jaggi, who is in the shower, has no issue with this and poses for her naked. When she sees the water trickling down his chiseled abs, she pauses. Eventually of course her anger melts and romance blooms.Read the full review on Film Companion."

","A movie of a love relationship between kartika and Jaggi where it's been portrayed that jaggi tries to pass various national borders in order to meet his love of life. But the story seems very much non practical and unreasonable. It's missing lots of facts bases. It's shown in the movie about jaggi who had a hook up with kartika played by Radhika and then he falls in love with her. At the same time, kartika behaves practical and just in order to get out of the situation she tells him to come to London and then she won't get married to someone else. And thats where the story begins of chasing her down. Mohit Raina and Diana's love relationship is shown as a support of the story and Mohit tries to be a god father of Jaggi to help him meet his dream girl. It's a cute love story with some illogical script writing. One time watch.

There is also a message coming across in the movie that love can exist in a long distance relationship and it may be missing in a loveless marriage.So we have a crazy, obsessed lover boy Sunny Kaushal who is besotted with pretty lady Radhika Madan and he stalks her all the time. He is all passion (Shiddat), full of energy and refusing to take "No" from the girl. Despite knowing that Radhika is getting married in London, he entreats her to cancel this marriage and wait for him. Like many of the illegal immigrants who take to sea/ land/ air routes to get into the land of opportunities, Sunny also does likewise, but gets caught by the law. But not to be deterred, he continues to make desperate efforts.Director Kunal Deshmukh has a difficult script in his hands but he converts it into a watchable film for Indian audiences. Could he have reduced the film by 30 minutes and made it better? Yes, undoubtedly. It sags at places.Sunny Kaushal has a complex role to perform which gives him a chance to showcase different shades of the character and he does it well.

So, here are the positives and negatives:Acting-acting is top notch. Mohit raina has done a wonderful job. He is such a naturalist. Sunny kaushal was equally good. He has shown in this film that he has an aura about him to be the lead. But my word is radhika madan so stellar. He is cute, beautiful, and extremely talented. Another female lead who can carry a film on her shoulders. Superbly impressed. The supporting cast including diana penty is good.Music and bgm-bgm is decent. But the main highlight is the music. Beautiful music is what it is. Be it 'barbadiyaan', 'shiddat' or 'chitta' all r beautifully composed and sung. A romantic movie deserves beautiful music and shiddat has got that.Writing-the first half writing is problematic. Stalking is a problem. It was and it is. Jaggi literally stalks her to the swimming pool even clicks a photo having her in his background without permission. But the second half is really beautiful. The conversations, the relationship problems are really good.Chemistry-there r two chemistries specifically. One between jaggi and kartika. Its beautiful. Both of them jel so good. The second one is between jaggi and gautam. A brother type realtionship where the latter really takes care of the former. Very nice to see that.Philosophy-the philosophy of love is fleshed out nicely. Jaggj,-kartika and jaggi -gautam hv numerous conversations regarding the love philosophy. There r certain references to soni mahiwal as well. It was really good to see.Climax-i was literally shocked by the climax. I never thought that this would happen. But at the end all matters is the shiddat, the passion which both jaggi and kartika had for each other.Shiddat is a film u really need to watch. Its a really good film. I rate it 8 out of 10."

This movie degrades the position of sportspersons, as well as film creators. Above all I have now started judging Radhika madan for doing such an immature movie, Rest of the cast is non mentionable.

Radhika Madan also looked fresh and talented. Mohit Raina looked subdued but carried his character well.

The movie wasn't bad but it wasn't great either. It's a different kind of "romance" movie; with the way the story was written, the direction, and it's production, which is the main reason why it seemed refreshing and unpredictable and wasn't bad.However, the acting was hit or miss in scenes. Sometimes you could relate to the character as to why they were feeling of behaving a certain way. But other times, you couldn't and it was mostly due to overacting. And that's why this movie wasn't great.And there were technical issues throughout the movie that broke the flow of the movie and made it feel quite unrealistic (swimmer not doing proper CPR; the boy falling from the top floor and can still walk, etc.)"

After watching the trailer i thought that 'Kids of the Night' is going to be the last one (definitely a so-bad-it's-good type of movie) but well, I was wrong.Everything started going downhill from the beginning - the cast was horrible. One of the sisters was supposed to be a student who had just graduated 11th grade, but it was extremely hard to believe since the actress who played her looked like she's in her thirties. Overall most of the actors looked and probably were way older than their characters, which just made it really cringy and weird to watch.On the other hand, there were some great actors who saved this whole catastrophe and made it somehow watchable. Peeter Oja and Argo Aadli for example were amazing and effortlessly funny as always, also Piret Krumm positively surprised me.There was absolutely no plot in 'Kids of the Night' - the movie just kept and kept going without anything remarkable happening. It was just a bunch of boring cringeworthy nonsense. I was really hoping that it's at least funny, but no. It was easy to tell that they tried to make it funny but it just turned out awkward and forced.So overall 'lapsed' was just a waste time and money."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11318086/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," A broken balance ","SumarioEste drama (que algunos califican como thriller) sobre la visita de un primo que perturba la vida de dos hermanas y su ta quizs ponga sus cartas sobre la mesa demasiado pronto, resintiendo en parte el crescendo dramtico de la pelcula. No obstante, logra algunos buenos picos de tensin y un realista tratamiento de la sexualidad y el deseo adolescentes.ReviewJuana and Mara, two orphaned teenage sisters aged 17 and 14, respectively (Malena Filmus and Lola Abraldes), live with their aunt Ins (Umbra Colombo, star of the recent Azul el mar) on a farm dedicated to beekeeping, producing and marketing honey. The arrival of Lucio, the sisters' cousin (Franco Rizzaro), alters the delicate balance in which the three of them lived together.The arrival of an "intruder" to an isolated and closed family system and the interactions that he produces with its members could be considered as a literary and cinematographic subgenre. The approach to the behavior of people in situations of rural isolation is also a topic, as if it arouses atavisms and violence that remain repressed in the urban environments of origin.One thinks of illustrious antecedents such as Borges's La intrusa (and its film adaptations) or Pasolini's Theorem. They arise for me among the immediate references of this film The Sleepwalkers, by Paula Hernndez, where the irruption of a cousin also triggers chaos, although in a more complex family environment. And the backdrop of the bees casually refers to The Cloud, the remarkable French film that combines family drama with horror.Perhaps as in one of those references, but in a feminine key, the inevitable triangle of the sisters with the cousin soon reveals an unexpected vertex, whose development also coincides with an affective crisis of her aunt, which makes her more absent as a family authority, in a subplot whose function would seem to be to justify that absence.The three adolescents refer to their sexuality (and in part they exercise it) spontaneously and without euphemisms (one of the successes of the film), in a story that stages the coming of age of one of the sisters.The problem with Lucas Turturro's feature debut is that he puts his cards on the table perhaps too soon; somehow, the director seems to prefer that we know that the road to disaster is served and that we live that journey as possible and see if it is inevitable from the balance of the forces unleashed. But he fails a bit (partly for that reason) in his dramatic crescendo, which he intends to enrich with certain revelations. However, the outcome looks between dry and precipitous and with some point not sufficiently clarified. This does not mean that there are some peaks of tension achieved, with good performances from the leading quartet."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11332500/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Better than other Mexican movies. ","A Mexican dramatic comedy. It is about two influencer who have known each other since high school and collide over the gruesome life they have in the past. Quality. Entertaining Ludwika Paleta and Regina Blandn make a spectacular dumbbell, they seduce with their performances, especially Ludwika. A well-thought-out story, albeit with some loose ends. The immaturity of modern virtual life exposed. Living by appearances. Of how important the followers of social networks are and of pretending what we are not, of always being us. Of how much we stop living reality to pretend something virtual. From the excessive use of social networks. Of what sometimes friendships tend to occur with the people we least believe and of the damage we can do to others. How little or how much we can value friendship. It roughly shows how immature human beings are to deal with the things that happen to us. Better than crazy about change and justified if it is. A movie for a pleasant Sunday."

I know that when you start watching a movie like this, you have to keep your expectations low, I was not expecting to watch an art house picture of a film that would change my life. Still, as a viewer, you expect at least a minimum of quality. I am sure there were thousands of decent options of movies to be made, with good actors, instead, we have one more lousy film that will just waste the time of the viewer. Avoid!!"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11332500/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," A rather decent movie in a sea of garbage ","As a Mexican who loves Mexican cinema, it has been disappointing to see the current state of mainstream Mexican cinema in the last 10 years. Good movies either don't get released to the mainstream or all we get are lazy and predictable comedies that often make good amount of money. Don't get me wrong, this movie still suffers from many of the problems almost all Mexican comedies have suffered from recent years: 2-dimensional characters, predictable jokes, and a dull writing in general.However, because of the extremely low bar, I would also argue that films does better than many of its predecessors like Cindy La Regia or Lady Rancho. First, unlike many other many other Mexican comedies, this film actually ridicules "Whitexican" culture. For those who don't know, "Whitexican", refers to those Mexican people that are usually rich and white who reject Mexican culture, overly westernize themselves, and usually only associating themselves with European or American culture. The film actually encourages the audience to embrace their Mexican identities like when the protagonist talks with Mexican slang such as "chido" because I'm a sole believer that Mexican Spanish slang is one of the best languages that can be put to film as seen with movies like Y Tu Mam Tambin, Amores Perros, and anything Luis Estrada ever made. Moreover, this film doesn't over rely on sex jokes, cheap slapstick comedy, or the overuse of curse words, instead, most of the jokes have some originality to them while some of them are a little awkward but still passable. I think all the main actors bring a lot of charismatic energy to the screen that make the rather mediocre main characters more fun to watch, specially Regina Blandn.On the other hand, even though that characters didn't have much depth to them, the writers did avoid using the usual stereotypes that can be seen in many other Mexican comedies. For instance, when I thought that Loreto Peralta's character was going to be the classic whiny rich girl stereotype, I was pleasantly surprised by the extra level of self awareness that her character brings to the film.In addition, the soundtrack is great and the editing also not bad as it really makes the first act seem a lot more interesting than it actually is on paper. Finally, even though the moral of the story is delivered like it was written by a 3rd grader, it's still a good moral: social media can corrode us and makes us forget about who we truly are and who we truly want to be.Overall, this film left with a good taste in my mouth and I think that's already doing better than many Mexican comedies. Is this the best comedy Mexico has to offer? No, of course not. I believe that even in recent years, many indie Mexican comedies have done a way better job than this. But...if we are talking about mainstream Mexican comedy, I think this a step in the right direction."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11333938/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," A Cracker of a Movie. ","There were only two things I knew about this movie, John Rhys-Davis and, the movie was a comedy. I didn't see any trailers so, didn't know what to expect. What a treat was instore.At 63, I thought I'd seen it all; the same applies to my 88 year old mother, boy were we wrong. When parts of the movie are missed because of laughing so loud and for so long, you know everyone involved have a winner on their hands.I didn't know any of the other actors yet, they played their parts as if having 10 or more movies/acting years under their collective belts. It wasn't a big production however, the resultant movie didn't need it. It would have actually taken away from the experience.This is deadpan comedy so, it won't suit everyone, comedy is subjective to the viewer. Give it a shot, the most you'll lose is a few minutes, and it will only be because the style of comedy doesn't suit personally.I'll have to get the DVD or download, to fill in the gaps, that's how well I enjoyed it."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11333938/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," BEST 20 MIN. IN A BATHROOM SCENE! ","Quirky, romance-themed comedy about love and the role Cupid plays in it. Cupid is Archie, played by John Rhys Davies, as a curmudgeon matchmaker, who's tired of the role he plays in love and will do anything to succeed. Great scene in the bathroom that could have been stretched out for the whole movie. Many laughs at the banter going on between the characters about Dave's love situation. If you are looking for something different, this is a go."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11333938/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," A Nice Valentine's Comedy ","Before I watched Bad Cupid (2021) I had already watched some scenes, as I promoted the movie in the last couple of weeks... Well, these scenes were like a good dj vu, as I laughed once again watching them. Actually, I laughed in many moments. The screenplay is full of nice jokes - I loved the scientific fiction one in the beginning - and well thought out dialogues, like the conversation between Dave and the lady in the bagel shop - I laughed a bunch. In this path, I highlight the interactions between Dave and his cousin, they were great due to the writing and, essentialy, an incredible chemistry between Shane Nepveu and Briana Marin.I confess that before watching Bad Cupid I was afraid John Rhys-Davies would get all my attention and I wouldn't get into the adventure that much but it didn't happen. I enjoyed once again his performance, his commitment with the character and the text, translated into a very charismatic and true Archie, as real as a fantastic being (a Cupid) can be but also, embraced Dave's story and connected with Shane, the other actors and their respective characters. The casting is great and did a wonderful job. Besides, Briana helped a lot with keeping the comedy throughout the movie, she is fantastic!I liked the plot, the mix of fantasy and reality and I definitely didn't see the end coming like the crew stated that would happen in their promotional texts.The pace is enjoyable. The only moment it dragged a little was in the bathroom scene. In a short movie it seemed too long and even more when compared to the other scenes. I really liked the connection between them, the editing. The idea of adding animations to indicate a change in time was brilliant.About technical features, I loved the choice of sets in a snowy and small Buffalo rather than a sunny and crowded place as usual in rom-coms. I also enjoyed the soundtrack and scores.To end this review, Bad Cupid fits perfectly Valentine's Day. It's worth watching and entertained me and my mom, who doesn't speak English yet understood the story (before my explanations) and liked it too."

I enjoyed the acting, the humoristic situations, the funny dialogues, the 'freshness' of the latino actress, the originality of the script. There's one long scene in a plain toilet of some bar that's over 15-20minutes long. It must have been a feat to keep this scene interesting. Nice!"
