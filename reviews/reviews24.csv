Like Harada's previous historical features Sekigahara and the Emperor in August, Baragaki is -packed- with references that casual viewers may find hard to pick. The movie does not pause, things move quite fast, the dumbing down is limited, the background and explanations about the balance of power at the time are left to a minimum (besides a few scenes that are very obvious exposition dialogues). The viewer feels thrown right in the 1860s. The spectacle, even without the references in mind, is enjoyable enough, with a couple well shot swordfights and battles here and there to keep the non-history buffs interested in a flick filled with political talks about the power balance between various factions, treason, and treachery.The movie is not for everyone. Readers of the novel will find that some characters seem close to their descriptions in the book (Okita Soji, specifically, seemed to jump from the pages) and the numerous aficionados of the Shinsengumi will have a lot to discuss..."

Tropes like farmer issues, corporate honchos, one-against-many set pieces, and intro songs add nothing new from an artistic standpoint. But is it wrong to expect at least decent craft and racy storytelling from these films? Sulthan is a masala flick that does one thing right: it gives more than sufficient screen-time to Sulthan's goons (whom he considers family), even giving one or two (like Lal's character) some layering. Apart from this aspect, Sulthan just gets too loud, soapy, (needlessly) violent, and ultimately generic. The emotional turn in the climax can be predicted from a mile away. The antagonists are so poorly written (and performed), making it a tad too obvious that they aren't legit threats to Sulthan. The numerous song & dance routines, the bland fight choreography, the terrible body-shaming humour (Yogi Babu is at the receiving end of it again!), and a weirdly sketched romance between Sulthan and Rukmani (a not-so-effective Rashmika) are bummers."

"," Bakkiyaraj Kannan's Sulthan: Karthi And Rashmika Mandanna Star In A Generic 'Mass Movie' That Could Have Been So Much More ","The first half-hour of Bakkiyaraj Kannan's Sulthan - starring Karthi and Rashmika Mandanna - is pretty promising. (Let's ignore the mandatory hero-intro song!) It's like a mashup of Thevar Magan and the Mahabharata. From the latter, we get a bloodthirsty Kaurava-like clan that does all the rowdyism and goondaism in Chennai. Napoleon plays the Duryodhana equivalent, the leader - and Karthi (i.e., Sulthan) is the Kamal Haasan-equivalent from Thevar Magan. He does a posh job in a posh city and when he returns, he is disgusted by the bloodlust that's such a part of his family. The mythical element runs right through: from Sathyan Sooryan's shadow-rich cinematography to Sulthan's birth, amidst rain and bloodshed. And around the thirty-minute mark, we get the "knot": what Sulthan has to do, what his mission is. It's perfectly placed."

That's the biggest draw back I felt or else it could have been 7 to 8 rating movie.They actually dragged the first half putting pointless scenarios which was disconnected. And second part more feels childish or probably trying to bring the comic element but failing to do so.The second half is more for the hero's antics to impress heroine and how he can save his gang. That is like making criminals scapegoat to one's own fantasy and needs, while doing caring for them.Villains against the hero you basically don't have much characterization rather than just menacing aggressive image. And there is less of an empathy built for those 100 gangs he is standing up for at the beginning. Even actress didn't had good character arc other than stiff image all the time and at the end sorting it out.Its got a good overall performance in acting but story in second half is really hurts the movie. Ending is, Just Ok , because you expect what's going to happen!There is a bodyguard in the movie who got an amazing height and build. The movie is as such, got good potential but doesn't make any sense why he is there at times. Lost chance but for Karthi fans definitely it's a mass entertainer. Go watch it in your near theaters."

Karthi's screen presence is awfully low. He's suffering to dance. Rashmika struggles to speak Tamil and her dubbing artist isn't of much help. The director tries hard to not focus on her face while she speaks.They've tried a little KGF here and there and what has been a result of it, is nothing but an unlimited dose of cringe. The dialogues are better at some points and worse at the others. The color tone, set to the film, seems periodical, but unfortunately, the film takes place in 2016! There's no morning or evening in the film, only plain yellow. Awful lot of mistakes filled film.The songs are good, but not unique. The lyrics are unique, but cheesy.

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11503178/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," An action thriller India can be really proud of. ","When I first heard of Wild Dog, I was excited to see Telugu cinema attempt another action thriller of this kind, but was worried it might take the route similar to other Indian action thrillers which somehow limited their appeal to domestic audiences only by adding songs, comedy and romance tracks. This is one front where Wild Dog vastly improves on. No comedy, no romance, no unnecessary melodrama or songs (no, not even at the very end), but only pure action and suspense. While the story and presentation might not be very groundbreaking especially if you've seen a lot of similar undercover operation stories, the execution is arresting and makes Wild Dog a racy watch.It's great to see Nagarjuna in a different kind of action role, one that involves both brain and brawn, but with zero shades of his "mass" hero charisma as we have previously seen. He is totally apt for this character and there is not a single moment where he seems inconsistent. Saiyami Kher is stunning, and her character is pretty well written. Atul Kulkarni is impressive as usual. The actors who play the team members are also effectively used, and the actor playing the villain does a similarly fantastic job.Wild Dog's biggest plus point has to be its taut narrative. Almost no scene can be edited out without affecting the story, which is quite surprising given how most Telugu action movies have something you can always easily discard without harming the plot. The action sequences are very good, grounded and fairly realistic. The final one, especially, relies on the background of the situation and arising tension due to which it keeps you on the edge of your seat. It's also good to see the CGI work deftly handled; a lot of similar Indian action thrillers I've seen in the past have left me disappointed with their unfinished CGI work but this film manages to get that aspect right as well.Thaman might not have been given a scope to provide us with songs, but his background score is stupendous and remains with you even as the credits roll. While having seen a lot of similar Indian (not Telugu alone) films, such as Action (2019, Tamil), Chanakya (2019, Telugu) and even web-series such as Bard of Blood (also 2019) creates an occasional sense of dj vu, the fact that Wild Dog is inspired by a true story, is devoid of "masala" and is just focused entirely on the story means I am ready to overlook any flaws it has. It's finally the action thriller even international audiences can enjoy without worrying about unnecessarily popping out songs and dances, and something whole of India can be proud of. Yes, the sense of familiarity can be a flaw off-putting for those who've seen a lot of this genre, but to even see Indian filmmakers trying to create something like this without packaging too many things at the same time, is both impressive, relieving and worth encouragement from us viewers. Go, stream it on Netflix!"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11503178/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Based on a true event ","The storyline of this movie look like is too real and just amazing. Acting is also superb. Overall very good movie."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11503178/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," If you like this GENRE you'll LOVE it too. ","Wild Dog is not new in terms of story, you may have seen this story in many films like Baby, Phantom, also in Family Man. This film also falls under the same genre.No over the top scenes are there, it fully focused on it's story. Screenplay is very fast and engaging specially in the 2nd half. That's why you'll not get bored while watching.Some scenes shines very well specially one FOLLOWING scene is there, that is executed exceptionally.Ashishor Solomon in his debut feature has done a brilliant job. The lead character is not shown in a heroic way. They've tried to show us everything in a very real way. We all know it's a patriotic film but patriotism is not shown by pointing out our eyes, that's another positive thing of this film. It's a very well researched film, so I think you should watch Wild Dog for it's DETAILING.Available on Netflix. MandalBros."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11503178/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Nice rivetting action film ","#sanjuzzreviewsBased on actual incidents, this film tells the story of our unsung heroes who, keep their anonymity under wraps, while still defending our country selflessly.Wild Dog is about how our NIA bravehearts carried out a daring covert operation to nab Yasin Bhatkal from Nepal.It starts off with the German Bakery blasts in Pune ( all names changed in the film) and how a team of NIA agents lead by Nagarjuna try to locate the perpetrators of this heinous terrorist activity.After a couple of near misses where the target manages to give them a slip, they finally land up in Nepal based on a tipoff. How they manage to nab him and get him back to India forms the crux of the plot.This is Nagarjuna's film all the way. At his age Nagarjuna looks extremely fit to play the part of the protagonist & carries the entire weight of the film on his shoulders. Saiyami Kher & Atul Kulkarni play their part decently.Slick editing, engaging storyline and rivetting action scenes make it a decent watch.Similar to Akshay Kumar's Baby, but a little low on the tense adrenaline rush moment's that kept us on the edge of our seats.Adios"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11503178/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt"," An annoyingly slow moving film ","Granted Nagarajuna hasn't had a good film in a while. But, why does he tend to choose roles of either maverick policemen, maverick investigators or maverick soldiers? What is it about a job that grants a gun and a team that makes Nagarjuna happy? Is he wanting to return to action? If so, why just this avenue? There are so many stories he can choose from. He's Nagarjuna! The problem with Wild Dog is that it's ineffective from the word 'go'. The writing is lazy and reminded me of an early 90s made-for-TV film starring Peter Weller (I think).Coming back to Wild Dog. The acting is lazy while the action feels uninspired. The CGI is so 90s while the BGM seems to have been taken straight from first-person shooter games. There is not a single character that sticks in your mind.When I was watching this film, I was reminded of Payanam, a superbly crafted thriller surrounding a plane hijacking. Nagarjuna plays an NSG in that film and his role in Wild Dog is no different from that, except for the fact that Payanam had far better writing. Wild Dog just isn't wild anymore. I don't think it's even a dog."

For starters try "Wild West Country" with hara bhara kabab or Paneer Manchurian or Threaded Paneer or simple Pakodas fryed to crispy golden brown, gulp it down with Pepsi or Aam panna or lemonade."

The setting of this film is authentic, the locations are gritty, and the actors do a good job fitting into their roles. Thrilling at times, and a little boring in parts, the movie failed for me in justifying its runtime. It's also a little dumb for its ambition for telling a complex story. Also, the blaring music every minute is pretty headache inducing. But anyway, it gets the job done and Nagarjuna looks handsome as ever. Thumbs up."

The film is less engaging because of its story. Without any story the film extends the movie and that to at the end almost like half an hour is wasted for showing how the team is crossing the border and that part is very less engaging as it is very much predictable. As an action thriller with this kind of story must deal with a lot of action scenes, but they did not show much action scenes. While watching this movie personally I never came into a seat edge experience like 'Uri : the surgical strike' or 'Raid Redemption'. The film could have been better be more interesting plot and with more action scenes. That's it for this film. One time watchable, can try if your bored. Available on Netflix."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11503178/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," Disappointing and not impactful ","Again the overused story in cinema has been used again..ok-ish screenplay..some scenes were overperfomed and clichd..nagarjuna has done good....same dialogues in almost every movie can be heard here..some scenes were illogical too.Pls skip it..you have already heard this story."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11503178/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," Decent Thriller and comeback from Nagarjuna!! ","Despite the 2 hr duration, the film is bit slow but it has definitely a good content. No nonsense and no deviations in the plot. Some similarities with Uri & Baby films. Climax is very engaging and amazing action sequences. Overall a decent comeback from Nag after Devadas. We are not good with numbers. Given the low budget involved and apart from Nag, the rest all cast is almost new, so remuneration costs will also be less, and having the pre Netfix deal in hand, we think Wild Dog would end up as a profitable venture."

","Looking at the star cast, I was hopeful for some entertainment but alas... this one turned out to be a major disappointment.I could barely pull through this one for 40 mins. Phew!!!Nagarjuna's and Atul Kulkarni's talents are wasted.And so is my time...Alas!"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11503178/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","1"," People need to understand that media is not always right!!!! ","What a waste of talent! Instead of this go for Special OPS.I respect India and I respect their unbiased media but when movies like Wild Dog (2021) are made based on the biased views that lead the movie or series, that where they just make it about the money rather than facts and entertainment.The Special OPS series deserves its praise and stands out for its marvelous reputation. I am from Pakistan and I loved the fact that they never directly blamed my country for anything. But rather showed that the country has nothing to do with the terrorists but rather the terror attacks are led by an independent group."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11503178/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Engaging Manhunt! 6/10 ","Check out my other reviews! I give reviews for all new Telugu movies!!!Special Note to the cinematography. Cinematographer Shaneil Deo has done quite a great a job for its budget. It shows his experience that he has also done a lot of other successful thriller movies such as Adivi Sesh's Goodachari. The scenes where Nagarjuna is enquiring people and talking, is matched to a Hollywood level thriller. One can say Shaneil Deo has took the film to the next level.Wild Dog is a manhunt story of catching a criminal through inquiries and action. It is very routine for a investigative story and it might remind you of Akshay Kumar's Baby. Unlike Baby, Wild dog does not have have too many tension building scenes that will thrill you. Although it is plain, the screenplay is very clean cut. This movie would not be possible without Nagarjuna. The director must thank him for giving him the opportunity to direct a non-mass movie with a star like Nagarjuna.In Depth Analysis:First 30 minutes: This part is an ok start to the movie. It shows Nagarjuna as a former CIA agent nicknamed Wild Dog. We feel as if this part is too plain. There is no constant curiosity established killing us to see the whole movie. One thing I observed from the movie is that the director tries to establish almost everything with just dialogues. This is very weird since movies are all about SHOWING not TELLING. By only telling, the we don't completely get the feeling of the full intensity established. Luckily for the movie, the rest of it is about to be 10 times better.Rest of the movie: The rest of the movie is pretty good. It starts out with Nagarjuna doing inquires on finding out who the villian is. The inquires initially start out slow but pick up the pace rapidly making us very involved. Starting from when "Mission Wild Dog" starts, the movie takes a step above. We get the feeling of a thriller that we wanted the whole time. The thing that was lacking at first will finally come. Even though it is very good audience that watches a lot of movies won't find anything new.Overall the movie is a routine investigative thriller that is lacking at first but as the story progresses and as the movie picks up pace it will thrill you for sure!Check out my other reviews! I give reviews for all new Telugu movies!!!Scale to Compare:9.0/10 Mahanati, 8.0/10 Kshanam, 7.0/10 Goodachari, 6.0/10 Wild Dog, 5.0/10 Saaho, 4.0/10 Agnyathavasi."

Its an edge of the seat flick while watching at big screens. Each and every conflict portions of this film will make your spine chilled. And the fights of this film is bloody brilliant. And Thaman's background score just killed it. A super bgm by Thaman after Krack (2021) movie. And Sayyami Kher and Atul Kulkarni did a fantastic performance. Dia Mirza did quite justice to the role she has been assigned, for a short while. Unlike Godzilla Vs Kong, this is also a must watch big screen flicks mate. Don't miss this opportunity."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11505680/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," "B" Grade Vampire Spaghetti Western ","I saw "Death Rider in the House of Vampires"-just the name itself was intriguing-starring Devon Sawa-Escape Plan:The Extractors, Final Destination; Julian Sands-The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, Warlock; Kim Director-Split, Book of Shadows:Blair Witch 2 and Glenn Danzig-he is the founder of the rock group Danzig and this is his first movie to act in.This movie is written, produced & directed by Glenn Danzig, who also makes his acting debut in it, too-if you don't count the music videos he's done. This is his second film to direct, with 'Verotika' being his first. This movie is sort of like a 'B' grade-and I say that generously-vampire spaghetti western. The acting is bad, the camera shots end abruptly, some things are overly exaggerated, but the girls are nice to look at. The movie opens with Devon-Death Rider-riding with a girl tagging along, tied to a horse, and she seems to have lost her shirt somewhere. I must say that she is healthy, though. Devon is headed for a place called sanctuary and admission to the sanctuary is a virgin, so that explains the girl that Devon has with him. Julian is the head vampire of the sanctuary/business that has a bar that they use to lure in dinner guests-kind of like in 'From Dusk Til Dawn'. Kim is the head social director that keeps the girls in line and Glenn plays a frequent patron. There are a few cameos; Eli Roth, Sean 'X_Pac' Waltman and Danny Trejo. This movie is not for everyone but if you like 'B' grade movies-I do-you might enjoy it.It wasn't rated but I'm giving it an "R" for bloody gore, violence, language and nudity and it has a running time of 1 hour & 32 minutes.Like I said, it's not for everyone but I liked it and would buy it on DVD."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11505680/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," With characters named Bela Latigo, you know not to take it seriously? ","Finally, Cinema is able to show us what a 70s grindhouse vampire/western might have looked like. From the start is looks like the movie is using, " purposeful incompetence ." Danzig is going after the look and feel of a cheezy, sleazy, grind house horror flick. He reproduces the imperfections down to the smallest detail. If you're able to recognize that early on you might enjoy the movie more."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11505680/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," Grindhouse B movie fun ","Given the incomprehensible mess that was his first film Verotika, Death Rider In The House of Vampires actually was fun to watch. Yes, there were plenty of technical flaws; lighting, fade outs, zooms, and it was too quiet. But I am cutting Danzig some slack. He isn't schooled in film and you can never tell if he is serious or not. Personally, I like B movies, I like Danzig so I found enjoyment in this, but if you don't know who Danzig is you may well find this garbage. The opening credits alone were a weird yet captivating sight. As for Tasha Reign, the topless girl in the beginning of the film, she's an adult film actress and again, this is a Danzig film. If you're familiar with Danzig we can't be surprised at this. As Joe Bob Briggs is wont to say boobs, blood and beasts are what makes B movies, and in this day and age of uptight political correctness I found this throwback element fun. Julian Sands was good and brought credibility to the film, Devon Sawa was good too. Eli Roth brought energy and he commanded the scenes he was in. It was even fun to see Danzig in the film. Again, it is what it is. It was an improvement from Verotika. There was an actual story here and for a Danzig film I enjoyed it."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11505680/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","2"," The B movie of this generation ","Movies like this don't seem to come around too often, at least I don't see them.Definitely a B movie reminiscent of the 70's, includes an over use of blood and an abundance of gorgeous women, some missing their shirts. If you're in to B movies, this is the movie for you... I suppose some people would drop it in the category "So bad it's good", but just like "The Room" I don't really agree with that - it's just bad.It does have a few good things about it -Besides the girls being great to look at, they're actually not the worst with their acting. Their accents and slang from the wild west were pretty decent, not gonna win an oscar or anything but, decent. Also, Julian Sands (The Count) seems out of place here since he actually plays the part really well, the best acting of the movie by far.The story and setting is also fun and as far as I know pretty original, although the plot is VERY basic with dialogue to match.Also one small thing I really liked was watching them shoot their pistols. It looked pretty realistic (as in, not perfect).Honestly, the whole film could be elevated to a praiseworthy B-movie that almost shouldn't be classified as a B-movie if it fixed 2 things:1) Editing -The shots hang on way too long. I'm not sure if it's for "artistic" value or what, but way too many times does it zoom in on a character and then fade out over an uncomfortable amount of time, sometimes the zoom will even have a clear stop and then an ever-so-slight zoom again (which made me laugh).The couple of fight scenes could improve by leaps and bounds too.2) The sound mixing -WOW the film could be SO much better if this was done right. The movie is QUIET except for dialogue.The score is barely heard and when it is it's very low, and the bar scenes especially suffer from this.You can tell no one is making a sound in the scene and you can only hear the faintest whisper of background chatter added in. You need glasses clanking and people talking over each other. It's seriously very bizarre that the sound levels for background noises (extremely low) and effects (abnormally high) are what they are, but dialogue is normal. Actually, a lot could be elevated by the sound mix being fixed, even the acting.I had to rate it a 2 because even though I appreciated the original plot and enjoyed the film more than "The Room" (which I also rated a 2), the technical issues are just too glaring to overcome."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11505680/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","1"," How this movie has a 6 out of 10 I do not know ","Might be the worst movie I've ever seen. The first 20 minutes can be skipped without missing anything.there are no redeeming qualities in this movie. The acting is bad, the dialogue is bad, the sound editing is awful. I have no idea how they got Eli Roth and Dany Trejo into this lousy excuse of a movie."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11505680/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","1"," There wasn't enough alcohol to make this movie bearable. ","Do you love Westerns?

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11505680/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","1"," From Dusk Til Yawn ","There's nothing to enjoy here. It feels like Glenn just ran into a bunch of has-beens and decided to shoot a movie in the desert that weekend. He raided the local Spirit Halloween, grabbed some black lights, crapped out an outline, grabbed a camera, and made the magic happen.I want to say that "I can't recommend" this movie, but I honestly recommend that you find it for free somewhere. I'm not suggesting any avenues with which to do so, but don't pay money to see this. It's worth watching just so you can say you've seen the worst movie of the past 25 years. I don't know, when did Rollergator come out?Glenn Danzig did provide, unintentionally, a very positive message from this turd: ANYBODY, literally ANYBODY, can direct a movie.Do you think you have a movie idea, but are afraid it will be bad? Stop. Go watch this movie and realize that you have a better gift for filmmaking that Glenn Danzig. You might not have the same means, but you absolutely have more talent.Get a Kickstarter going; Backerkit; GoFundMe. Do whatever you have to do to get your movie made. I guarantee it will be better than this."

I probably could have made something similar with my cell phone....lol. No. Just kidding. Is this movie supposed to be a comedy or a spoof? The plot was so shallow. The sound also seemed poor. Maybe that was because there was no background music? The silence between the the dialogue of the actors just seemed so noticeable to me. I had to struggle not to turn it off halfway through it."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11508438/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," Nostalgic Buddy Film ONE FOR THE ROAD Nails It ","One for the Road is full of nostalgia as multiple genres come together including romance, buddy film, as well as sex-positive melodrama. The film had a wonderful soundtrack with some Cat Stevens music along with several mainstream hits, a strong production design, and a lovely mise-en-scene with exquisite cinematography and a touch of colorization. One For the Road follows a young Thai man, who is dying from cancer and has decided to make his final amends by delivering a parting gift to those closest to him on the earthly plane.One For The Road is very visual, very visceral, and one I was sad to see it end after 136 minutes. But end it did and as the credits began to roll, there it was - a title revealing "Produced by Wong Kar Wai" - "... a filmmaker who specializes in making the evanescent tangible, in capturing fleeting emotions in a style that is always poetic, often ravishing and, despite his films' surface-level dreaminess, unerringly precise." I'm a huge fan of Mr. Wong's work so all I could do in that moment was sit and smile. What a wonderful gift. (Wong and Director Baz Poonpiriya worked together on One For The Road for three years.)Director Baz Poonpiriya, a strong storyteller who has come into his own, had previously helmed Bad Genius the 2017 Thai box-office smashing and the record-breaking winner of twelve categories at the 27th Suphannahong National Film Awards (the Thai Oscars), before embarking on One For The Road with Wong. If you're a fan of Wong, this is a film you don't want to miss. And, if you're a fan of Thai film (Apichatpong Weerasethakul's 2010 Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives turned me on to Thai film), it's a must-see! Lastly, if you simply enjoy exquisitely told films, I highly recommend you see Baz Poonpiriya's One For The Road!"

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11525644/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," Soderbergh and big stars ","It's 1954 Detroit. Curt Goynes (Don Cheadle), Ronald Russo (Benicio Del Toro), and Charley (Kieran Culkin) are killers hired for an easy three hour job. They are to babysit a woman and her kids while her husband Matt Wertz (David Harbour) is forced to retrieve a document.Director Steven Soderbergh gives me a monotone feel with this movie and it really grinds me down. The music is all smoky slow jazz or no music at all. Everyone is talking in a monotone. I actually really love the first thirty minutes with this caliber of big stars doing a gangster movie but Soderbergh's deliberate visual moves and tone really saps away the intensity.There is also something about the ultimate premise which is very annoying. It comes late in the movie and Soderbergh wants to tell us all about it in the closing text. It finally occurs to me that this is a high concept premise from somebody who had this idea after smoking some weed and listening to a paranoid conspiracy theory. It's the last straw for me."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11525644/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," No Sudden Move ","Steven Soderbergh has turned his back on big budget movies. He now wants to make something more personal, idiosyncratic and still attract a starry cast.No Sudden Move has crooks crossing each other to the Nth degree. It also takes potshots at the automobile industry and their attitude to environmentalism.Set in Detroit in 1955. Curt Goynes (Don Cheadle) is a hood fresh out of prison and offered an easy job. Big money for just a few hours work by a shifty man called Jones (Brendan Fraser.)Curt and two other men. Ronald (Benicio del Toro) and Charley (Kieran Culkin) need to burst into the house of Matt Wertz (David Harbour.) They will then watch over his family as Matt is taken to his office where he must retrieve an important document from his boss's safe.The easy job goes south very quickly. Both Curt and Ronald though find a way to stay ahead and make money out of it. It is just a case of who to trust as everyone has something to hide or an angle.Matt for example is having an affair with his boss's secretary. Curt has upset a lot of major people who want revenge against him. Ronald is having an affair with a gangster's wife. Nothing is what it seems.By the end you just know no one is going to end up with what they are after. It becomes the film's weakness as it gets too convoluted as more characters are introduced. Although one character who mentions he cannot stop making money turns out to be absolutely correct. He ends up with more money even though he was the one being blackmailed.Soderbergh has gone for a lo fi approach. Some scenes look slightly off with its fisheye lens. One thing is for sure Brendan Fraser looks even more porkier because of it."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11525644/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," Sometimes things get sloppy ","The film uses (PLOT SPOILER) the suppression of the catalytic converter by the auto industry as a back story. In Detroit 1954, three men are to "babysit" a family while dad breaks into his boss's safe to get documents, documents that have been removed.The plot is rather jerky in how it moves taking enjoyment out of the feature. It s always nice to see Ray Liotta get beat up. Matt Damon in an uncredited role explains the workings of the world.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11525644/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," "You're pushing more than numbers now, big guy." ","I was a little dismayed when the first dozen or so reviews I read here on IMDb were negative with one and two star ratings, but felt better when I pulled up the ones who liked it. I mean, what's not to like? The cast is first rate and the story line is filled with double and triple crosses that keep the viewer guessing about who the real bad, bad guys are. My guess once again, is that those with short attention spans give up after the first fifteen minutes and decide it's too difficult to follow. Not only is the cast great, but they suit their roles perfectly in a gangster flick that has elements of a heist movie, with the grand prize oddly enough, a mock up of a catalytic converter that would revolutionize the auto industry but for it's threat to the profitability of the era's vehicles. The title of the film is appropriate, save for the fact that even the most well thought out plans by the lower level gangsters turn to naught. Don Cheadle and Benicio del Toro do the heavy lifting to carry the story forward with Jon Hamm and Julia Fox in surprising turns with their characters. And if I've never seen Brendan Fraser play the role of a heavy before, he does it here in more ways than one."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11525644/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," I bet most people didn't know the story of the catalytic converter ","I sure didn't. Not that I'm surprised. When have corporations cared about the public good over profits?But anyway, Steven Soderbergh continues to prove himself an outstanding director with "No Sudden Move". Throughout much of the movie, you could cut the tension with a knife.The cast includes Don Cheadle, Benicio Del Toro, David Harbour, Jon Hamm, Brendan Fraser, Ray Liotta and Matt Damon (in other words, Paul Rusesabagina, Che Guevara, Chief Hopper, Don Draper, Encino Man, Henry Hill and Will Hunting)."

","No Sudden Move is a convoluted mess of a film and not compelling.Some quality actors here that I love, but given roles that don't suit and certainly not together. Fraser and Duke in particular, woeful. Damon's minor role to the contrary."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11525644/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," Good actors but a very messy story. ","The thing with Steven Soderbergh is that you're not sure what you're going to get. Sometimes it's very good ( like The Knick, The Report, or Traffic) but on a rare occasion it can also be pretty mediocre or even really bad (like Schizopolis). No Sudden Move has a very good cast. All actors that know what they're doing so that wasn't the problem. The problem was the story. It's a complete mess, with so many twists and turns that nobody with a sane mind can understand anything about the plot. I don't know what Soderbergh was thinking. It's all much too complicated to be a good movie. It's all shot well, all acted well, but if the plot doesn't make much sense it loses all credibility. Too bad because Benicio Del Toro and Don Cheadle did a very good job, even with a plot that they probably didn't understand themselves. Maybe you need to watch the movie two or three times to understand everything but that seems too much of a hassle to me. I'll just wait for a better movie from Soderbergh."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11525644/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Stellar cast and director going nowhere ","This is a heist movie. For any heist movie, you're better off just re-watching "One Crew over the Crewcoo's Morty". The genre is formulaic by design, often involves a cast of very well known people and movies in it should be performance pieces. I mean, no one cares about the loot or what happens in the end, they just want to be entertained by the loops and twists of the story and the way actors make you care about their characters. And on that metric, No Sudden Move is average at best.Right now I am struggling to mention anything that might be worth mentioning and getting nothing. It's not like people acted badly, but their characters were completely uninteresting and the story went nowhere. Even if it was "inspired" from the story of the catalytic converter and the collusion of all big car manufacturers to keep it off the market, which is true, the rest was complete fiction. And the plot? Just people double and triple crossing each other. No action, no real stakes, no inspiring end. Just Soderbergh being nostalgic over the times when the Ocean's N movies were bringing him a lot of money.Bottom line: I can't recommend it yet I can't say it was a bad movie. It was just... uninteresting."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11525644/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," pretty good but LONG.. ","Some pretty big names... Don Cheadle, del Toro, Matt Damon, Ray Liotta, Jon Hamm. Director Soderbergh had worked with del Toro on Traffic, which is also where Soder won his oscar. I'm not familiar with Craig Grant, (Jimmy), but apparently he passed away in March of diabetes, even before this film was released. In the story, a group of guys has been hired to get a document at dad's office. But first, they stop at his family's house to hold them hostage. It's filmed in very dark light, so we miss a lot of what's going on. Very confusing. Things go massively wrong, of course, and now we watch the fall out. It's a period piece.. .the cars are from the 1950s or 1960s. This goes kind of like a Coen brothers. Dead bodies pile up. But there was an original plan that went very bad. Hamm is Finney the cop, trying to sort out what really happened at the family's house. About halfway through, we find out what they are all really after. And now and then they share a few more details. It's good, but it's overly complicated. Kind of goes on extra long. Written by Ed Solomon."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11525644/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Rear-View Mirror ","I was going to pan "No Sudden Move," not for its contrived con or heist plotting--this being the umpteenth or whatever caper flick by Steven Soderbergh, but for its contrived stylistic choices. Upon reflection, however, and while I still think it doesn't look very good, I appreciate the felicitous symmetry of narrative and style here. Besides Soderbergh seeing other heist flicks such as, say, "Widows" (2018), "Triple Frontier" (2019), "Da 5 Bloods" (2020), and, perhaps, thinking he, too, should make his heists historically and socially conscious--what with the 1954 setting here and addressing issues of race, urban renewal and car monopolies polluting--it's a modern eye looking back at a period piece. It's distinctly shot with a modern eye, too, as Soderbergh has taken to using a phone camera. The extreme wide-angle lenses, as well, don't just resemble a mislocated Chicago Bean, or Cloud Gate, obscuring the period details of the picture, or offering the paradox of a narrative full of conniving crooks, doubles crosses and switcheroos while photographically there are few angles being played; it's the convex nature of automobile rearview mirrors, thus echoing the story set in America's car capital, or at least what used to be such. I'm not sure what the title, "No Sudden Move," has to do with it, but at least all of the above may be argued to have a purpose.It also works for how these con/heist plots usually work, where information is withheld as we look forward and only begin to make sense in the end, if even then, as we look back and consider that objects may've appeared differently than where they actually were. Sure, the cast is stellar as usual, some of the talk-heavy set pieces are quite enjoyable in themselves, and there's some fun merely in watching all the pieces being moved--and transparently so for our entertainment, but oddly enough I especially admire how well the things I otherwise find garish--the phone camera fish-eye lenses and trying to make one of the most frivolous genres into social-problem dramas--work cohesively well in this case."

Its also a mobster crime story from the heartland u.s., with corruption and wargames like hide and seek, with some extended version of extortion at a human and not to grotesque violence level, that everyone may look at but made in a way thats very easy to loose attention to, but very well mended by the props and decoration departments that has made this like a back to the future experience to watch on the screen.The cast is fat on experienced actors, several hundred years of experience that is, and i must say that i had expected even more from them and mr soderbergh too. The easy switches and flips comes like a jesters joker, and the plotspeed are durably slow at moments, just like this review. So no more than a 6 stars from the grumpy old man, its well crafted by the whole production crew, but the thrilling thriller do lack some bait.

It had a mysterious and really interesting plot through the whole duration of the movie and the interpretations of the cast helped on that. The direction which was made by Steven Soderbergh was very good and he created a mysterious atmosphere in his movie while his main characters did their best in order to present the plot. Regarding the interpretations of the cast, Don Cheadle who played as Curt Goynes and Benicio Del Toro who played as Ronald Russo were absolutely outstanding and they both made the difference. All in all, I have to say that "No Sudden Move" is a huge surprise and I recommend you to watch it because I am sure you will enjoy it."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11525644/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," Great cast ensemble but boring script and film making it a waste ","2 out of 5 stars.No Sudden Move is a bad crime thriller film. That packs a big star power cast. The plot is forgettable and boring. The script is dull. The shoot outs is dull. And direction is tedious."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11525644/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," A mid-tier crime film ","Continuing on his return from what must surely go down as one of the shortest retirements in Hollywood history, Oscar winning director Steven Soderbergh is back to the crime genre his known so well throughout his career with the likes of the Oceans trilogy, Traffic and Logan Lucky with his new star-studded vehicle No Sudden Move, a direct to HBO Max feature that is easy to watch without ever becoming the riveting outing it thinks itself to be.Without question better than Soderbergh's previous efforts such as the diabolical Unsane and the barely noted streaming efforts such as High Flying Bird, The Laundromat and Let Them All Talk, Move is a quick moving affair that is shot in a bizarre fish eye like manner thanks to extra long lenses (a distracting way too have filmed this talk heavy affair) as we follow low end rent a criminals Curt Goynes and Ronald Russo (Done Cheadle and Benicio Del Toro) as they navigate a complicated job that goes south very quickly in Detroit of the 1950's.Not bothering with much in the way of set-up or exposition as we get introduced to Goynes and Russo accepting a job off Brendan Fraser's organiser Doug Jones, Move gets stuck into things without a fuss or worry but the travails of these two shady figures isn't always engaging enough to hold our interest, even if a late act play about what's really going on and what lays at the heart of the job at hand makes things far more interesting in the grand scheme of things, making one wish Soderbergh had allowed this too play out a little earlier to help overcome the films hump in its middle act after a solid home hold-up start.As is usually the case with a Soderbergh film in this genre, the films dialogue and delivery from a name brand cast ensures this small-scale film feels larger and more prestigious than it perhaps ought to feel like and having been long term servants of Soderbergh projects, Cheadle and Del Toro are as solid as ever as two rather generic central figures with lot of joy to be had in the supporting turns from the likes of Fraser, Ray Liotta, David Harbour and a surprise cameo from someone that may not in fact be such a surprise on second thought.Capturing the time and place of 1950's Detroit well and ensuring things keep moving even when not a whole lot is happening, Move is a polished middle of the road effort from Soderbergh but one still wonders what the whole point of his return from retirement is if his films continue to be of this generic nature, even if the technical aspects of them feel as though they're an excuse for a creative to try and find the next best thing.Final Say -Not always thrilling, No Sudden Move isn't able to match Soderbergh's best efforts in the crime cannon of films but its able cast and neat last act still make it worth a look.3 bottles of wine out of 5."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11525644/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt"," Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote. "," A big NO to the Dollar Tree fish-eye lens attachment ","What was Soderbergh thinking? What possible benefit could fish-eye lens offer besides being annoying?This is certainly one of Soderbergh's worst films. How did he miss fixing some of the many flaws in the scenes and dialogue from the convoluted and boring screenplay written by Solomon? It felt like some scenes were edited by a Ninja blender... dialogue that was either all over the place or insignificant - and unrealistic.It struggled identifying itself as a gangster flick, a gentrification movie, whistleblowing collusion within the automobile industry, or a heist caper. It stays stale and predictable throughout the entire 115 min slowly paced and dragged out runtime.If this wasn't for the star-studded cast - who performed very well, I'd say it was a failed B-grade film put together by an amateur writer and director. If you had told me this was directed by the Ocean's franchise director and written by the Men in Black and Now You See me writer, I'd call you a liar. If you told me it was written and directed the Teletubbies filmmakers, I'd believe you. What a waste of such a great cast. It's a very generous 5/10 from me."

Cheadle rules, Duke towers, Fraser was SORELY missed, & Damon's one scene is a standout. His infuriating speech about "the order of things" raises the white supremacy subtext up to text at just the right moment, reminding us that big business is just government-sanctioned organized crime."

I must admit that I often didnt exactly understand the plot myself, but I still DID ENJOY it! As some other reviewers already mentioned, this movie can become even better after a second watch (when I will better understand the entire plot :)Any bad? I guess this movie is best suited for the art house movie fans of more subtle portraits instead of the older "Ocean's Eleven" fans, because they might get easily bored for the lack of action and straight forward jokes..., although there is humor to be found in the bizarre and hilarious plot turns.The good: there are many things good about this movie! Terrific acting performances for one, a terrific direction and a terrific intelligent plot. And I mean really terrific, because anyone who has seen (and I have seen) ALL of Steven Soderbergh's movies, he or she knows that this director is a master at portraying a suspenseful, enticing ganster plot. Soderbergh did it again!The (convoluted, but superb) story: everybody is conning everybody. 2 small time gangsters (Benicio Del Torro and Don Cheadle) think (THINK) they have hit the jackpot after having stolen a very valuable document that the powers that be are after, but things arent what they seem to be.... :)"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11525644/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Okay, but just okay, 1950s crime drama ","As "No Sudden Move" (2021 release; 115 min.) opens, we are in "Detroit, 1954" and we are introduced.to Curt, who is hired for an unspecified "babysitting" job for lots of dough ($2K upfront, and another $3K afterwards). In a parallel storyline, we are introduced to Ronald. He and his girl seem like they are up to no good, and Ronald is also hired to be part of that "babysitting" job. At this point we are less than 10 min. Into the movie. Who is hiring Curt and Ronald? What exactly dos this "babysitting" job entail?Couple of comments: this is the latest film from producer-director-photographer-editor Steven Soderbergh. Here he highly stylish 1950s crime drama, in which it becomes quickly impossible to keep track as to who is double-crossing whom, then triple-crossing for good measure. The first hour is a bit tedious but things pick up in the second half. Don Cheadle (as Curt) and Benito del Torro (as Ronald) are fine in the lead roles. Keep an eye out for small parts by Ray Liotta and, most importantly, Matt Damon. The jazzy score is by David Holmes. Bottom line: this is an okay, but just okay, 1959s crime drama that is high on style (from the opening credits on) but low on pulling you in as an emotionally invested viewer. (In the movie's last scene, we learn that the vents actually happened, leading eventually to a mandatory federal reform of some practices b the auto industry.)"No Sudden Move" was delayed by the coronavirus (of course!). It finally premiered at last month's Tribeca Film Festival, and then 2 weeks later released on HBO Max. If you are in the mood of a stylish 1950s crime drama, or simply a fan of Steven Soderbergh's work, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11525644/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," No Sudden Move ","3 for hire criminals are paid to babysit a family whilst the father collects a document. It all goes badly wrong and they are obliged to work together to extricate themselves from the mess and possibly make some money while doing so.Fun, if rather complicated comedy (with a small c) thriller set in the fifties, this is enjoyably tense in places and you're drawn into the plot keen to know what's around the next corner and indeed what is the next twist. Del Toro is the more fun of the main pair with Cheadle the more serious but more clued in. Not a sensation, but a nice sense of the period and overall worth catching.Whatever Soderbergh thought he was doing with his anamorphic lens trick - it doesn't add anything."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11525644/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," Stylistic, but overwritten, complex and messy ","A group of criminals are brought together under strange circumstances and are given the relatively simple task of babysitting a family while one of the family members steals something from his employer's safe. However, as events progress mistrust begins to develop between the criminals when they become convinced that someone is setting them up...No Sudden Move oozes coolness, is stylistic, well-made and comes complete with top-drawer acting from pretty much everyone on-board and yet upon reflection I still saw it as being something of a failure.Where most of the problems lie with this film come from the writing; there are just so many characters and so many double-crosses that, at times, it becomes very difficult to follow what is going on. Some characters have so little screen time and so little dialogue that it's also difficult to see how and where they fit into the story and how far up the ladder they are so to speak. It's this messy approach to the narrative that left the film to be fairly uninvolving to me (despite being a technically well-made film).The cast do their best, but can do nothing to overcome an overly talkative and complex narrative which sadly does result in quite a dull film more often than not. Incidentally, what has happened to Brendan Fraser? I'm genuinely shocked how much weight he has put on.No Sudden Move is a film that I admire rather than love and the end result is a film that feels a little too ambitious for its own good. The sad thing is that I felt that there was an interesting story buried beneath all the clutter in this film, but I just didn't find it here."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11536262/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," A brilliant story of Digital Money Scam wasted by B Grade Storytelling ","Mosagallu (2021) : Brief Review -A brilliant story of Digital Money Scam wasted by B Grade Storytelling. Mosagallu is prime story for any cinema industry across the world but unfortunately it was selected by Telugu Cinema for the sake of vandalism. That typical thinking of making a mainstream entertainer has spoiled a potential classy piece of narrative. You know these money scams stories are interesting, almost all kind of audience wants to watch them despite the fact that it is slightly offbeat and away from commercial entertainers. Such films usually fall in thriller genre, some of them even goes for a drama. But all of this never go for a commercial potboiler, they keep intense and stylish features alive. Mosagallu failed to understand this basic rule of filmmaking. It has those B grade scenes you see any typical South masala film, it has the same vision of the director and all the actors performed with the same unintentional nature. The film is about fraternal twins, Arjun and Anu, who have been raised by their honest Father in poverty. Their hunger to make huge money leads them to a wrong path and they build the biggest IT scam country has ever seen. Like i said before, it's a great story, i mean really good. I just feel sad that it wasn't used properly by the director. Jeffrey Gee Chin makes an average mass film which does not suit its classy script at all. His lame vision to look at things and to create those situation pulls a potential classic much much lower. Even lower than a decent level. Vishnu Manchu and Kajal Aggarwal looks good on screen but their performances doesn't look anywhere close to good. It's just like dragging typical masala elements into atypical storyline that causes the destruction of intelligent storytelling. Overall, a strictly average film and much much lower and poorer than its original potential.RATING - 5/10*By - #samthebestest."

I really had a positive vibe with the start of the film and thought that finally, we've got one of the Telugu directors to save the Telugu film industry and the introduction was so strong and promising but as the film progressed, that belief went down so quickly in a spiral and there was no single scene that could lift the movie up, I wonder how could someone destroy such a good plot and make it feel so terrible for watching. Except for Rajamouli and few others, I don't think there's going to be anyone in this industry who's going to lift it up. Even sandalwood films are being made so good nowadays and Mollywood is rising like anything but this Tollywood is still not even got the stuff to even stand up, it's a big shame."

But in this movie, the so called 'poor' Minchu-rian got deal from his creepy boss in a five star night club and voila !! Next day, they have an office with fat and bearded sidekicks. Each and every character is so full of freaking attitude. Creepy boss is verbally abusing Kajal and Minchu-ran, Kajal is abusing boss and his brother, that beardo is abusing pushing and yelling at staff !! What the hell was happening ?What more can be ridiculous, the director made IRS look like a ordinary government office with atleast one stupid Indian talking in native language among Americans. Instead of investigating the complaints, the IRS is directly calling Sunil Shetty to find out the culprit whereas technically they should call Indian Embassy first.Americans are well educated people . They know agencies like IRS, banks etc never call on phone and ask for details. Even in India, IT department and bank continuously warn us about such things.
