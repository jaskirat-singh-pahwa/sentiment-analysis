"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11541538/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Pleasing and humorous film ","I selected Innumuthal on Zee5 (orig. Malayalam w/Eng. Subs) just by chance as it said Comedy.The film begins and ends with fabulous visuals of a grassland shola mountain range (Vagamon ??) with great music. In fact most of the songs in this movie were quite good.The main character Abhi (Siju Wilson) is not a particularly religious person, but like almost every Indian he routinely says a short peremptory prayer in front of his God. The narrative revolves around Abhi's search for his 'missing' Krishna, as in a tacky plastic idol of Lord Krishna which one day mysteriously disappears leaving only the plastic flute and plastic cow behind. Abhi is a taxi driver staying in rented rooms. He is always in debt, to his landlady, the local meals kada, his friends, to everyone. Nice typical Malayalam film 'dig' to show Abhi ordering erachi fry in the meals shop :-))) And of course Abhi manages to have money for the favourite passtime of guess what ???? Boozing .. especially with his neighbour Eltho ( humorously played by Gokulan).The film progresses in a lackadaisical and at times boring manner in the first one third. Eventually in great despair and at his wits end to get money to repay his debts and avoid being thrown out by the landlady, a weird looking person purporting to be the real Lord Krishna (brilliantly enacted by Sooraj Pops) suddenly appears before Abhi.The story really begins from here, with ample humour, poignant moments, some life lessons and realistic glimpses of human nature. This peculiar Krishna is full of quirky home truths, demolishing many myths (love the typical Mallu film digs), speaks more like a rapper and is a cause of much nuisance for Abhi. Abhi eventually believes that this joker person is the real Lord Krishna who promises him a good ending to his problems if he does as he is told, no matter how irksome the tasks may be.In short, Abhi sets out to do the various tasks set for him by Lord Krishna. The final task is to drop an elderly disabled blind man (Uday Chandra) to the railway station to catch his train home to rural Madhya Pradesh. Abhi leaves the old man in the train compartment which is chock a block full. He feels guilty leaving a helpless blind person on his own like that and ends up accompanying the old man in a series of transit journeys until they reach his village only to discover that the old man's wife and daughter have declared him dead, sold the property and moved on to greener pastures. Another Mallu film 'dig' here is guess who??? .. the current PM's poster in the village !!!Nice Anbe Sivam style touch in the remaining narrative .Innumuthal is quite a pleasing movie. I would have rated it an 8 and it would have been a much better film had the extraneous portions in the beginning been considerably shortened or dispensed with."

It's done in such a manner that it succeeds in keeping the viewers invested in the story and the characters all throughout the run time.The comic timing between the actors are really good. Gokulan stands out as the best comic performer in this one. But that is not to say others did bad. They too were quite good. In fact there is no actor in this movie who did his/her part in a sub par way. All of them did their roles neatly.The movie doesn't try to be something bigger than it actually is, which is good. At the same time, the marketing for this one was practically non existent, which may not be something good. I doubt if the general public are even aware about the release of this movie.If you want a light hearted entertainer which won't bore you, please do watch this."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11543916/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," A better-than-expected first attempt in Malayalam cinema! [+58%] ","This turned out to be better than expected. When the makers claim that this is a techno-horror thriller, they substantiate that statement with a reasonably engaging plot, solid visual effects (for a mid-budget flick), and a riveting central performance by Manju Warrier. The length of the film (with several stretched out scenes and largely unexplored characters) is a drawback. Packaged at 100 minutes, this could have been just as effective and crisper at the same time. That aside, the film does have a few surprises up its sleeve. Manju's character Thejaswini is not showcased as a damsel in distress, instead, as someone who's ready to fight back. The writers also do not waste time building a romantic relationship between Thejaswini and Antony (an okay Sunny Wayne), her business partner. Even though the film begins with Thoreau's quote: "Men have become tools of their tools", it never gets preachy around how we have basically succumbed to our smartphones. Alencier's supporting act is also worth a mention."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11543916/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," An attempted horror thriller with bit of horror but none of the thrills! ","The eagerly-anticipated first-of-its-kind 'techno' horror thriller in Malayalam, 'Chathur Mukham' premiered on Zee 5 today.The film follows the story of Thejaswini (Manju Warrier) a cell-phone addict and aspiring entrepreneur as she encounters a strange phone that appears to be haunted with a vengeful spirit. Try as she might, she cannot get rid of it and is forced to embark on a perilous journey to investigate its antecedents.Despite an interesting premise and good production quality, Chathur Mukham falters due to sub-par acting, especially from Sunny Wayne and a laughable antagonist. The jump scares are few and far between and the suspense elements are simply not nearly engaging enough.The film is criminally overlong at 2 hours and 18 minutes and tests your patience by exploring several tangential sub-plots that have no impact on the core storyline.Another film that tried to balance both the horror and thriller genres, Chathur Mukham achieves some of the horror but none of the thrills.Manju Warrier is however, a delight as the leading lady and it is her superlative performance, alongside the innovativeness of the core idea that makes the movie moderately.An interesting concept that could have been executed so much better!Not recommended!"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11543916/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Superb Techno Horror content ","First of all, do not fall for negative reviews. Most of them are paid to write stuff.The movie is not boring. The concept is really good, one of its kind in India at least. Its about a girl who is addicted to social media and ends up buying a mysterious phone which turns her life upside down. In this movie, there is not much emphasis on exorcism but on science which is one of the reasons what makes this so unique. The concept of physics and electromagnetic waves and its impact on containing the negative energy. We cannot deny that negative energy does exist, which most people term as supernatural encounters or ghosts. If you have no belief in those, then this movie may disappoint you.From an acting standpoint, Manju Warrier does a fantastic job. She has the kind of innocence and realism which makes you empathize with her character when she realizes that her days are numbered.Compared to Cold Case, this movie stands out in terms of concept and execution."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11543916/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," A warning for the overuse of mobiles! ","A fresh and noteworthy attempt at a techno-horror flick, it turns out to be a frightening Chathur Mukham for those who indulge in obsessive overuse of mobile phones. While it features ample tense moments and an engrossing plot laden with convincing technical solutions to combat supernatural happenings in the flick, the fourth face perhaps gets slightly soiled because of a few unrealistic scenes and loud filler performances.Spoilers alert:-A techno-horror flick, Chathur Mukham is perhaps the first of its kind in Malayalam cinema. Encompassing quite a few tense moments, it keeps us engaged with apt background scores and convincing visual effects. With a smoothly progressing storyline, I liked how the script tried to technically supress the supernatural happenings.The ills of overusing mobile phones have been brought out well, amidst the events of the flick. The character of Manju Warrier has been portrayed effectively as a mobile phone addict, while getting constantly taunted by her friends and family for her overindulgence. It was a nice touch to show how Liza affected her physically in locations like her hands, which are supposedly the distressed spots because of an excess use of mobiles.If you ignore a few loud filler characters like Basheer and a few unrealistic scenes like a fallen mobile tower not being attended by the nearby people or authorities even after considerable time of the event, it turns out to be a different and engaging watch."

Couldn't take it much seriously.They could've come up with some more clever death scenes.Dialogues felt artificial in many places. Some scenes were completely filler ones.This reminded me of some ok ok movies like 'Countdown', 'Truth or Dare' etc from Hollywood.Manju Warrier was a miscast. She doesn't look like a late 20s or an early 30s woman.Acting was ok. But there was nothing great for anyone to do in this."

So, congratulations to the writers, directors and producer for thinking out of the box, but that's not everything, the movie is trash, it is extremely void of value.The plot is about a woman who faces horrifying events after buying a smartphone.No remarkable acting from anybody who were seen on the screen.The cinematography looked amateurish at many times. The lighting and color grading were focused on making the frames look good instead of creating a mood.The directors didn't do anything apart from pacing the film well.The writing was pretty good too and it was pretty watchable and viewer will feel engaged.All these are in the first and second acts.Now when it comes to the third act, whatever there is - extremely horrible. The screenplay consisted of a lot of unconvincing elements. The direction was so poor, the good pacing which was there previously was lost, what's shown on the scenes are so tense but the viewer will have to watch so passively and pretentiously without feeling any emotions. Another major element in those scenes were visual effects, and it would have been much better if the VFX work was given to some animation students.The movie is Watchable - except the final act, but still, watch it at your own risk."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11543916/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," A promising attempt trapped under cliches. ","Chathur Mukham is slated as a novel attempt in Malayalam Cinema to conceive a genre 'Techno Horror'. Personally, I'm not inclined towards this genre, primarily the difficulty seen in the makers to convince such plots. I strongly remember the early 2000 Star Plus series 'Vidyut' played by Yashpal Sharma wherein the makers failed miserably to convince a ghost terrorizing/communicating via electricity.Coming back to Chathur Mukham, the only aspect that I adore about this film is that the makers were able to build a convincing plot. Having said that, the makers were not able to capitalize on it and they fell into a trap of cliches, illogical reasoning, and a lazy build-up till the climax.Spoilers Ahead - The film starts with a mediocre tone, introducing the characters in the usual setup, and we have a special opening scene for the main protagonist, not sure whether this was really needed in the setup.Even though the start was mediocre, the first half tries to steam up the plot and kept me hooked, and this was the best part wherein I was sold to the plot hands down, even though I was well aware of the drawbacks that the plot was riding on.From the second half onwards, the plot reveals and from then on the movie takes a downward journey. This led to a set of illogical fallacies to justify the phenomenon, like the 21 days mystery, the 3.14 morning time, the scar marks, it does not add up to a graceful closure when we are done with this film.The narration had a tough time building up the mood throughout the film, the characters especially the lead characters were found in different emotional graphs at critical junctures in the plot, there were many intercuts introduced between key scenes negating the overall eerie feel, leading to a larger discomfort.Though the plot was convincing to me, it looked unconvincing to the characters dealing with it, this could be probably due to an improper cast, apart from Manju Warrier the key cast behaved very differently, especially Sunny Wayne, the character and the performance was a total let down.Of course, the climax had to introduce the scientific reasoning aspect, there were some nice scary moments during the climax. The climax somehow dramatically resolves the conflict scientifically, the supernatural phenomenon still hangs on leaving scope for a sequel, this treatment still is a norm in the horror genre especially, even I have tried it in my attempts :)Chathur Mukham - Try your luck!"

"Kin Dread" has an intriguing story line that combines solid acting, great production value, a polished, cinematic look that separates it most most of its indie film competition. The lead actor was especially good, and he reminded me of a young Anthony Perkins. This is a movie that needs to be paid attention to, as the director Adrian Leon asks his audience to do some of the heavier lifting in connecting plot points, which is indicative that Mr. Leon trusts his viewers. The set-up in the first act set the stage well for the rest of the film, and although act two sags a bit, the film closes with a couple of unexpected revelations. However, the film makers had a definite look and vibe in mind when making this movie, and in my view attained their goal of a very good-looking movie.

Adrian Leon accomplishes a lot on what appears to be a limited budget but his imagination and inventiveness is evident from the jump. I love the audio / sound engineer element of the plot, which evoked such classics as "The Conversation" and "Blow-Out", with a little "Rear Window" thrown in there to boot. Following the protagonist Winters, the shy shut-in, who spends most of the film speaking to an Alexa-type device, could have been a slog if it was put into less capable hands, but Ethan David Smart shines in the lead role. I will admit that were times I found myself a bit lost in the various layers, the film really coalesces in the final twenty minutes. Leon manages to stick the landing, delving into full on horror, with a character reveal I never saw coming. Check out this twisty little gem today."

","Due to the abysmal state of Hollywood cinema of recent times, I've been watching a lot of indie films - a sea change, if you will. But this hasn't been without a tidal wave of problems either. You know what I'm talking about. After reading the synopsis for Kin Dread, I thought maybe I was in for a Blow Out clone, but I like Blow Out, so in I go. That being said, it's pretty clear from the beginning that Kin Dread treads its own path in the uncrowded sound designer thriller genre. Erring on the brooding arty introspective side, Kin Dread actually looks and sounds surprisingly decent. Another pleasant surprise is that the leading player exudes a cinematic magnetism that's rare on the indie scene.

All three aspects are well incorporated into scenes that may very well leave you as they did me... feeling like I've been in similar scenes in my own life experience. You may know it as well... that feeling you can only get at dusk in the desert, or in the middle of an awkward moment with another person where neither of you can immediately find the right words to redirect an unspoken, yet obvious misinterpretation.The majority of the actors in Kin Dread turned in performances that made their characters believable, especially those of Winters (Ethan Smart), Alan (Patrick Cupo) , and Jane (Elinor Gunn). These actors didn't just have to "feel" the script, they had to communicate it, and they did it well.Kin Dread is an Indie thriller worthy of your undivided attention."

","Originally a Japanese comedy film released as 'Key of Life' in 2012. Then it was remade in 2016 by the Korean film industry as, 'Luck Key' and now 5 years later, forward to 2021, its China's turn to remake it as, 'End Game'. I am at odds to understand why it was deemed worthwhile to warrant three releases by three different nations? The story is not that impressive and the script lacks a comedic touch altogether but, I believe that is because this is a black comedy drama that would be served best as a purely live Theatre stage performance. It would have much more freedom to express both verbal and visual comedic expression. As a film its to restricted and hampered by less flexible rulings!I love Andy Lau as an actor (I have done since I first saw him in film some 20 plus years ago) and he puts in a good, but subdued hands tied, performance. His costars are perfectly in balance with their roles but it just doesn't kick-start into top gear at all. In fact I found myself so bored with the first 15-20 minutes of the film that I almost stopped play (and I have never done that with an Andy Lau film...ever!). However it suddenly started to up the pace which helped keep my continued viewing but, it still had a lackluster flow to it...not a rubbishy film but rather a dragging its heels meander! Its a bit much when the star factors of a film turn out to be lighting, cinematography, camera work and editing.Not the best film of the year and so I would hope we won't see another Asian country remaking it but, it could be worse I suppose...you could have some Hollywood idiot decide to give it a go, Oh HELL NO! Because we all know what happens when Hollywood tries to remake Asian films in a Western way, don't we?!"

As expected, he was my favorite aspect about this motion picture as the trouper steals the spotlight whenever he is onscreen. His true identity is then swapped with onlooker Chen Xiaomeng (portrayed by Xiao Yang) who balances off Lau's performance. Bringing his own charm to the table as a depressed and failed theater actor who seizes this newfound opportunity of adopting the life and wealth of Quan, unbeknownst as to how the former built his foundation.Endgame is the second remake of the 2012 Japanese film Key of Life. Despite the blatant similarities, I was still entertained with this adaptation as I was invested in how these two men would haste to their second chance at a fresh start at life. This not only lead to solid comedic-timing but compelling character arcs. Especially when Quan is devoted towards building himself from the ground up with the aid of his newfound companion, Li Xiang (portrayed by Wan Qian) who was a worthy another addition to the cast, bringing emotional levity to the lives of their characters.And these two men eventually come to the notion that this unnatural "occurrence" may have been a blessing in disguise once they begin to discover the hidden meaning that was absent in their former lives.Last but not least, the cinematography by Cao Ying was a visual treat that I benefitted from this whole experience.Follow me on Instagram: @joshuarenealvarez @theflowerhuman."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11576330/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","3"," Too slow paced and uneventful... ","Just because a movie has an interesting title doesn't mean that the movie itself will be interesting. And that was the case with the 2021 horror movie "Diavlo" (aka "The Devil's Child").I was fortunate enough to stumble upon this horror movie from writer and director David Bohorquez by random luck, and with it being a new horror movie that I hadn't already seen, of course I opted to take the time to sit down and watch it, even without knowing what the movie was about.And while I managed to endure the entire ordeal to the end, then "Diavlo" just offered very little entertainment to me, and it was very difficult to get submerged into the rather mundane and boring storyline as it was just so unfathomably slow paced. Actually, the storyline was lacking interesting elements to it, so it was a struggle to get through this 2021 horror movie.Visually then there were definitely some interesting aspects to "Diavlo", but it wasn't never anything that managed to more than just poke at the embers. A shame really, because the movie would have benefitted tremendously if it had more contents visually and story-wise.The acting in "Diavlo" were adequate, but the actors and actresses were rather hindered by an inferior script and a bland character gallery. So they were fighting a somewhat uphill battle.For a horror movie then "Diavlo" was just not outstanding or memorable, and it was a movie that came and went without as much as a groan or a bite. And this movie will slowly fade into the mists of oblivion and never come back out for a second viewing.My rating of "Diavlo" lands on a generous three out of ten stars."

","By a novise in the craftmanship called filmaking , then this is a wonderful clash of many different generics, but most of all its a holocene horror flick and a psychological thriller, that goes wild in the house in the woods and squanders into some syntax errors here and there, but sentimentalism is all blown away, the triggerpoints of adrenaline rush are like a hipster on times square, the musical score is a great part of the script and vice versa, the filmography dilligent and vaudevillish like, and the use of light and dark are on the artistical high plains.Though the story aint large on word, its complexity of the spiritual level is monstrous, we are talking about the devil and the devils daughter here after all, and the casting crew has found some fresh brunette for the lead role, a brunette that the grumpy old man wants to see more from, her voluptousness is just staggering and 10 wild horses couldnt have held him back if 50 years younger. The worst part of all , she knows how to act...it seems to me that the production crew is basicly colombian, though all spoken words are in the english language, and no typical south american aka latinos were present in the castline, weird if you ask me. But all in all its a dreamy horror fairytail that you will enjoy while watching, what comes afterwards, do tingle your analytical fantasy. Cause its a film without a clear answer, but all the questions are brilliantly made and presented. So go for it, its a visually well made film, and therefore a recommend."

What also caught my attention is significant rating drop in past two days which means that audience in Pula has their standards high up.There are two things to point out in the beginning which came from observing remarks of other people watching this movie. First one is that there are plenty of references that might be really difficult to understand to the viewers from countries other than Croatia and its neighbors. Second one, presence of Branko Uvodic attracted some of the older audience probably thinking it would be some easy going music show. Well, it's not. And they didn't hide their displeasure on violence and swear words.Plot is rather straightforward and faithfully follows one of The Warriors. There are many references there for other movies that influenced the director and there's an outstanding amount of details packed in every scene. Acting is extraordinary, given the fact that many of actors are still "green". As music is a center piece of the movie, it is well adapted into it, combining tamburica arrangements with hard rock in a subtle manner that really blends into the movie.Croatian movies have been dominated for a long time with dull dramas which have almost identical motifs, seeing such movie was one refreshing experience.

For the first 30 minutes of movie I still thought something will happen and this "comedy" will start to be funny. Suddenly not and with time passing it was just getting more boring and after an hour or so I was counting time left to the end. I can't criticise actors or recording. I just think that script/main plot was very poor and it was impossible to get more from it. I can't recommend but if you like Croatian movies, you might try it out."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11580854/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Sarpatta Parambarai promises too much in the first half just to become a BIG BORE in the second half. Same old Story survived by New regional conflicts. ","Sarpatta Parambarai (2021) : Movie Review -Pa. Ranjith's filmography doesn't offer anything extraordinary so expecting a sort of watchable flick from him shall be considered fine. However, Sarapatta suddenly started looking something better and overwhelming after the trailer so obviously people began to expect more from the same director who hasn't delivered a quality product yet. The movie does not surpass that unauthorised hype created by the trailer, but like I said, that typical Ranjith film, it fulfills that. You know, every sports drama has four stages- First Struggle and Training, Second Success and third is downfall and fourth is comeback. Sarapatta uses the same formula in same old manners with additional regional conflicts of honour and politics.Set during the 1980s, the film revolves around a clash between two clans namely Idiyappa Parambarai and Sarpatta Parambarai in North Chennai, which also showcases the boxing culture in the locality and also the politics being involved in it. There is nothing in the film which you haven't seen before in any classic or good sports drama. Although, the film actually looks sensational in the first half with terrific storytelling, it lacks the same effects in the second half. There is literally nothing in the story in the second half that can keep you hooked or interest you except for the boxing match scenes and that too comes with same old cliches. Remember Bollywood Movie 'Apne' (2007)? Just exclude family drama from it and you are almost here.The film is entirely carried by Arya but every actor in the film has given equally great performance. It is just a matter of screen space. Arya might be the frontier but Dushara Vijayan, Pasupathy, Kalaiyarasan, Santhosh Prathap, Anupama Kumar and Sanchana Natarajan are no less in their particular spaces. The music is highly engaging and tappy for the situations and thankfully none of them adds anything in the predictable boredom. And lyrics should be given equal credit for that.Sarapatta has one or two unexpected turnaround in the midway but that just goes without solid follow up. Ranjith could have had it trimmed, actually, that's one of the biggest reason why film is a big bore. Almost three hours for same old cliches, fair? Certainly not. 20 minutes were easily removable. Even few boxing sequences are shot childishly or better say are edited in such manners. It's 2021, not 1991 to make such noticeable blunders, especially when the main context the film depends on it. Overall, Sarapatta Parambarai is surely watchable for good performances and cliched story of an underdog blended with regional conflicts but just don't expect anything outstanding.RATING - 6/10*"

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11580854/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Pa.Ranjith is back with a winner! [+74%] ","Pa. Ranjith's latest film ticks almost everything you expect from the man: there's racy action (in the form of impressively staged boxing bouts), social commentary on the issues of the '70s North Madras working class and their warring communities, well-etched lead characters, and frames filled hordes of people. Arya slips into the role of Kabilan (a labourer-turned-boxer) with ease, his physique the perfect add-on. While he's red-hot in the action sequences, his performance is found slightly wanting in the ultra-emotional ones. There's solid reason why Ranjith stages the film in the '70s: characters (and even entire communities) are affected by the happenings of the times.Solid supporting acts form the backbone of the film. Be it Pasupathy (as Coach Rangan), Shabeer Kallarakkal (as Dancing Rose, with an intriguing demeanour), John Kokken (as Vembuli, Kabilan's unbeaten nemesis), John Vijay (as the Anglo-Indian Daddy, his mixed dialect adding to the fun), and Dushara Vijayan (as Mariyamma, Kabilan's wife who struggles to keep him in check). Cinematography by Murali G often gives you the spectatorial perspective - that feeling of sitting amid packed, cheering crowds. While the 2h 53m run-time may look worrying, not a single scene is unengaging. Even Kabilan's gangster turn is portrayed in the form of a long montage using frequent jump-cuts. In another film, it would have required an entire hour.The biggest difference-maker here is that the coach character isn't the typical one you'd see in regular sports films. He's philosophical in his approach, but also tactical. The dynamic between coach and pupil is wonderfully picturized. The plot and its intricacies are mostly on-point, except for a few random attack scenes that come off as lazy. Kalaiyarasan's character (coach Rangan's son) is a bit too conflicting and his transitions (from cunning to considerate) in the film feel more abrupt than organic. In Sarpatta Parambarai, Ranjith makes an effort to let us know how boxing became the favourite sport of North Madras and eventually, a determinant of the protagonists' lives. SaNa's pulsating musical score adds zing, especially to the action scenes."

However, for Sarpatta and Idiyappa clans, it was more than the boxing - it was the pride of making clan win in the ring.Directed by Pa Ranjith (Kabali and Kaala), the very first scene of Sarpatta Parambarai when the factory workers leave everything the moment alarm triggers announcing the beginning of the boxing event shows the culture and the mania that has gripped the people of Madras for the challenging sports. We are immediately introduced to the character of Kabilan who is passionate about boxing but never get the chance to prove himself. As the coach of Sarpatta gets the challenge from the rival clan after the defeat, he choses Kabilan who work tirelessly to bring down the undefeated champion Vembuli. Like other boxing flicks, Sarpatta Parambarai also shows how the once popular Kabilan gets shadowed under wrath of revengeful act, alcoholism and petty crime. Despite all odds, he makes a comeback and does it best with the a crucial boxing climax scene. I also loved the fight scene between Dancing Rose (Shabeer Kallarakkal) and Kabilan which is brilliantly choreographed that you want to keep watching it again and again.Sarpatta Parambarai does suffer from duration which is close to 2 hours 53 minutes that does not favor the momentum it builds up initially. Also, the screenplay suffers with a predictable climax, though saved by a good punch in the end. However, the beautiful art direction by T Ramalingam and astonishing camera work by Murali G. Transforms you the world of Madras during the 70's era along with superb background score by Santhosh Narayanan.Sarpatta Parambarai is enhanced with a very good characters performances. Arya as Kabilan steals the show and performs the role as it was tailor-made for him. Ditto for Pasupathu who plays Kabilan's coach, Dushara Vijayan as Mariamma and John Vijay as Daddy who brings value to the boxing drama.Overall, Sarpatta Parambarai is probably one of the best sports drama ever to come out in Indian Cinema which gives a knockout performance. Excellent 3.5/5.The boxing drama is produced by Neelam Productions and K9 studios and is currently streaming on Amazon prime."

Story was understandable and most curtural differences weren't that disruptive.That being said, from a technical standpoint this movie does not perform. Most camerawork is fine, but editing looked rough. ADR was pretty noticable throughout the whole movie, and acting was passable but mostly sub par. Also, for a 3 hour movie this film has a lot of pacing issues. We get to see 3 different training montages for example, wich is just too much. And most of the story felt jarring and not streamlined at all.So all in all, it was felt like some fresh air, but from a cinematic standpoint not really a good movie.5/10: fun for once, but nah."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11580854/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," An unexpected one from the director ","A unexpected one from the director. One could never imagine how a director like Ranjith could make a film like this although he hasn't left his signature of making it in the suburbs.The film stands strong on the boxing arena by taking us back to 1980s and it does make us feel like living there for bits and pieces with so many environment, mannersims & stylings that the film portrays. The clash b/w 2 clans were shown very well in the broad light and was very evident throughout the film but the film for most part travels with multi layered characters and doesn't show well establishment of any of its characters which makes it the huge flaw just like other films of the director.More than the climax fight, it was the match b/w Arya & Rose which stood out very well and after the climax, the director's unusual way of showing everything in a positive light did stand out as well.There are so many flaws just like the director's other films has and main one being: not giving a finish to any of the characters, leaving us feeling like having watching something incomplete or half baked."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11580854/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Well made sports political period drama ","In 1970's tamilnadu, there were two boxing clans- Sarpattai and idiyappa. Sarpattai clan is struggling in boxing as the boxers are all getting beaten up by idiyappa's star boxer vembuli(john kokken). Kabilan(arya) from Sarpattai clan is very much interested in boxing but his mother is against it because his father was a boxer and turned into a goon getting killed by his enemies. That's why her mother fears his son going his father's path.Sarpattai coach rangan(pasupathy) challenges vembuli for a match and if Sarpattai loses then rangan will quit teaching boxing. Rangan's son vetriselvan wants to contest but rangan rejects him as he is reckless and doesn't have the skill to fight vembuli. So he chooses another student raman to fight vembuli. Raman feels uncomfortable training with rangan so he hires another coach for the match which upsets, and at this moment kabilan rises for rangan and challenges Raman for sparring. Kabilan knocks raman down and later idiyappa clan's dancing rose to fight vembuli. Raman's uncle thaniga offers help to vembuli in the match if he is unable to beat kabilan. Vembuli initially refuses, but during match when he was getting beaten up by kabilan, he gives a sign to thaniga for help who creates a ruckus during the match and stabs kabilan at back. Rangan gets arrested as he is active in dmk govt which collapses during emergency.After rangan is jailed, kabilan injures thaniga and is imprisoned temporarily. After getting released, he and vetriselvan starts arrack business, where kabilan turns into a drunkard and goon like his father. One day when Kabilan is attacked by some goons in front of his wife and child, kabilan decides to change his ways. After rangan gets released, kabilan returns to him for boxing but rangan disowns him as he went wayward. Despite rangan abandoning him, kabilan decides to fight vembuli. Vembuli also agrees as audience humilated him that he lost that match against kabilan. Kabilan's mother sends him to former boxer beedi rayappan for training. Rest of the film is whether kabilan beats vembuli or not.Sarpattai parambarai is not just about boxing but more than that. It has subtle political stand, and sets the 1970s Madras during emergency period well. Most of the characters are also interesting. I liked john vijay's daddy, pasupathy's rangan and dancing rose characters. Vetriselvan is also a complex character. The heroine resembles bhumi pednekar in some angles. All actors performed well.The drawbacks i felt was that it has various clichs of a boxing film like how an inexperienced kabilan beats down trained boxers. Another drawback I felt was regarding arya's appearance. His character is from slums but he his fair and glowing skin and well dressed costumes don't make you believe him as a slumboy. Also, in the unfit portions its clearly visible that he used prosthetic for a potbelly. His ripped physique is awesome.On the whole Sarpattai parambarai is long but well made sports political period drama. After the disappointing kabali and kaala, pa ranjith is back in form."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11580854/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," A great sports movie ","The plot was actually great and it shows how our Indian movies should be . Lead performed his role nicely. There were some fine twists and I never got bored while watching this movie. This movie will be having a scenario of 1970's and Madras boxing competitions. Rest you'll get to know when you'll watch this movie. Ending was fine too."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11580854/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," World class cinema ","There are two new movies on boxing that are streaming on Prime and it is inevitable that both would be compared with each other. I have one suggestion to the cast and crew of Toofan, that they should hang up their gloves, once and for all.Sarpatta is a length film, clocking at 170 minutes. To me, it seemed like two different movies.The first one that lasts till intermission is 90 minutes long and is mind-blowing. It is humbling to see such world class cinema come out from India. These 90 minutes for me rank amongst the best cinema on boxing, of all time and stand their ground against all time classics such as Raging Bull, Rocky and Million Dollar Baby. They are populated by unforgettable characters, moored by their societal roots. There is an element of caste consciousness and strong over current of discrimination. The boxing scenes are shot brilliantly. As I wrote earlier, this is too notch and can be compared with any boxing film of any time.The second half was a let down for me. It ticked all the suspected boxes, which was a let down and ended predictably. It seemed like the effort of lazy writing.The director, Pa Ranjith, gives a masterclass of sense and time. It is the screenplay of the first half, which has so many unforgettable scenes and interactions between real world characters that is the hero. But it's banality in the second half also makes it the unintended villain.Still this is very highly recommended. It might be India's entry to the Oscars and if that happens, it would be worthy of that laurel."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11580854/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Period Sports Drama!! ","After a long time, it seems Pa. Ranjith got his mojo back. The screenplay and character introduction and motives are well established like 'Madras'. However, though the narration progresses like a 'one-on-one battle between hero and arch rival', there is a brilliant shift of character in the 2nd half. The climax ends like a typical sports drama, and special mention to 'Dancing Rose' and boxing choreography. You will like it if you have liked previous Pa. Ranjith movies."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11580854/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Director Ranjit, Take a bow, Sir !! ","What a comeback, it's been for director Pa. Ranjit, after a great start to his career with films like Attakathi and Madras and losing his way while collaborating with a big star for two lacklustre movies. Ranjit fires on all cylinders, and against all odds to deliver something that has never been delivered to Tamil cinema audiences, a perfect sports drama. Sarpatta Parambarai doesn't have a parallel in the history of Tamil cinema, where the directors usually stick their guns to, age old proven formula laced movies or dud mass entertainers , they very rarely stick out to experiment anything with a substance. Sarpatta Parambarai, delivers not only the substance, but along with it a sting too. The movie not only focuses on the Madras boxing scene in the late 1970s, it also highlights the politics, rivalry, relationships, infrastructure and things at stake during those times. Using Indira Gandhi's emergency as a backdrop within the story is a classic touch indeed.Cinematography is terrific, highly detailed 4K visuals presented in 1:1.85:1 ratio is just perfect for home audiences. Screenplay is fantastically written with so many vibrant characters. I don't think I have seen a Tamil movie with so many characters that are colourful and equally important after Kamal Hassan's Virumandi. Production design just is top class for a Tamil movie, costumes and makeup are highly convincing and excel throughout the movie. Editing is again, fantastic, as the editor doesn't let the pace and intensity drop for a major portion of the movie that has a runtime of a whopping 174 minutes. Santosh Narayan's Background score is apt and doesn't not overshadow Ranjit's hard work. Watch out for the song when the end credits roll.It has been a long time in Tamil cinema where the whole cast has collectively delivered strong acting performances to match Sarpatta Parambarai's quality. The stand out performers in the supporting roles are led by, John Viyay as Kevin/Daddy, Kalaiarasan as Vetriselvan and Pashupathy as Rangan Vaathiyaar. The Rival boxers John Kokken as Vembuli, Santosh Pratap as Raman and Sabeer K as dancing rose too play their parts convincingly. Arya is definitely a much improved actor since Mahamuni, and his acting performance and bodily transformation adds a lot of positives to his career. Even Dushara as wife and Anupama Kumar as the mother have delivered wonderful performances.Overall, Sarpatta Parambarai has a lot of things to work in its favour, be it the Treatment, Quality, characters, acting performances and a wonderful storyline that will make this movie a cult classic. Sarpatta Parambarai will not only end up just as a much loved film, it will carve a place of its own in the history of Tamil cinema and be remembered for a very long time. The movie is Highly Recommended for audiences all over the world, yes it's bit lengthy on the runtime but rest assured the story is packed with lots of vibrant characters and fireworks to keep the movie interesting for, almost its entire duration, I wish it was a 15 minutes shorter. But I am sure that Sarpatta Parambarai will definitely walk into the the hall of fame of Tamil cinema, maybe Indian cinema. It's a shame that movie couldn't make it to cinemas due to the pandemic. Thanks to Amazon prime for delivering it home. 8.0 stars out of 10 for a movie that replicates fifteen rounds of boxing in its storyline & filmmaking. Two Thumbs Up."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11580854/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," Hard worked sports drama ","RATED 10/10 Language: Tamil Source: Amazon Prime RECOMMENDEDSuperb sports drama with very hard work in all aspects. Especially the hero and other artists, art, BGM and direction...There is no single dull moment (except songs) and sincere making with very good entertainment value.As usual Ranjith mixed the sports with the voice of suppressed but this time its not out of the context... Must watch."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11580854/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Best boxing film since Irudhi Suttru! ","Sarpatta Parambarai is all that Toofan aspired to be and so much more. A well rounded, rustic yet impactful sports drama, it hits all the right notes in a compelling narration, accentuated by a superb lead performance from Arya.The movie tells the story of Kabilan, a blue collar laborer who is also a boxing aficionado and an ardent fan of the legendary coach Rangan (Pasupathy). Despite his mother's misgivings, Kabilian eventually takes up gloves himself and how the sport offers him a path to findinng purpose and redemption forms the rest of the story.Pa Ranjith delivers his career-best work after Madras (2014), sketching a painstakingly detailed canvas of 1980s Madras, filled with the caste and class politics of the time.Every supporting character is well written and perfectly cast. Anupama Kumar as the strict mother, Dushara Vijay as the ever-suffering wife and John Vijay as the trusty advisor steal the show in several sequences.The best thing about Arya is that he understands his limitations as an actor and uses his physique to overcome the same. The boxing sequences are expertly shot and Farhan Akthar and Bollywood should learn from Sarpatta as to how to capture the essence of pugilistic arts.Ultimately, Sarpatta effectively buys you into the storyline of an aimless youngster and how he finds himself only to get derailed on his journey and how he claws his way back.Pa Ranjith shows us that the classic tale of the underdog, when told right and with heart, can still capture hearts everywhere.Recommended!"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11580854/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Great first half, was a drag beyond that. ","The downside of doing a boxing movie is there have been several movies before, so what story can you come up with that's new? The first half of this 3hr movie makes you feel like this would be different, but things go downhill after 1.5 hrs, after which, it ends up becoming any other generic boxing movie.The acting was really good by the cast overall, my pick of the lot was John Vijay (Remember Son of Gun from Oram Po?) Great set-design for a period drama, decent music and boxing choreography.This had the potential to be so much more, but I don't think the film lived up to its potential. Too long, too much going on. Toofan was a let down, so was this, but maybe that's just me.If you like a ripped Arya, some good acting + a fast paced first half and don't mind if the 2nd half lets you down, check it out."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11580854/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," A remarkable sports drama entertainer. ","Sarpatta Parambarai is a truly striking sports drama that punches above its weight. Besides being a raw and brutal sports drama, this is an intimidating tale of a man's true search for identity, his adversities, his seek for mother's validation, and his own redemption. The Boxing Clan rivalry in Madras in the 1980s is beautifully captured. Courtesy of Arya's unswerving performance, Santosh Narayanan's outstanding score, and PA Ranjith's masterful direction this 3-hour long film doesn't lose its grip and keeps you engaged till the end. A remarkable sports drama entertainer."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11580854/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," Pa. Ranjith's Sarpatta Parambarai is one of the well-made sports drama-packed up with excellent performances and a strong technical crew ","Tamil cinema has produced a couple of sports films in the past few decades. It's questionable whether these films did justice to the actual sport because most of our films are stick with the usual commercial formula which overshadows the use of the sport in the film. In fact, it only becomes a subplot like in M. Kumaran Son of Mahalakshmi and Ghilli. Pa. Ranjith's recent release Sarpatta Parambarai breaks all the stereotypical interpretations of sports in films and stands as a very unique sports drama ever made in Tamil cinema. Sarpatta Parambarai is all about boxing. Starting from its visually pleasing setup, the film is set in the 1970s. Pa. Ranjith doesn't use any conventional elements to make it a period film. He uses the characters to identify the period which proves his brilliant filmmaking skills. The biggest strength of Sarpatta Parambarai is the characters. None of the characters are perfect. They have all their own weaknesses and strengths which makes them relatable and connective with the audience. Each and every one of the cast has performed their role to the extent where they are irreplaceable by any other actors. They have all a scope to perform as well as to contribute to the main protagonist, Kabilan's journey. Arya's performance as Kabilan is very intense and realistic. He has portrayed the role with the heart and soul. He has dedicated himself to the film which can be seen through his physical transformation. This is by far one of the most defining characters that he had played ever since Naan Kadavul and Madrasapattinam. I can't speak about a particular scene to justify his exceptional performance because he has shouldered the whole film with his acting prowess. Another performance that blew my mind was the one of Pasupathy. There's no doubt to say that Pasupathy is the heart and soul of Sarpatta Parambarai. He plays his character with so much emotion, dignity, and love. The scenes that he appears in remain fresh because of his presence on screen and his performance. He is undoubtedly one of the best-supporting actors in Tamil cinema. On the other side, we have a unique performance from Dushara Vijayan who plays her role with such ease. She convinces us that she is the perfect match for the role with her beautiful performance. We have other prominent supporting actors like John Vijay, Kalaiyarasan, John Kokken, and Shabeer Kallarakkal who shined in their roles respectively. A special mention for Shabeer Kallarakkal's Dancing Rose character will definitely win your heart. Besides the extraordinary performances from the cast, we have a very strong technical team who made sure that Sarpatta Parambarai stays true to its genre and backdrop. From the cinematography to the editing, Sarpatta Parambarai shines in its own way. Santhosh Narayanan's background score gives life to the film. The emotional and cherishable moments are soulfully connected by his intense background score. Kudos to Neeye Olli and Vambula Thumbula. This sports drama envisions the pride of boxing and the honor of playing for the happiness of the people. Sarpatta Parambarai has a predictable story but it's the presentation that makes it overwhelming. Pa. Ranjith is known for presenting his films in a way that it connects with the audience. The emotions dealt with by the characters and their personal conflicts make us relate to them. The realism that Pa. Ranjith incorporates in this sports drama is the major element that brings to the world of Sarpatta. Unlike the usual sports films that we have seen in Tamil cinema, Sarpatta Parambarai is in a very different flavor because it deals deeply with a character's journey. There are no unnecessary subplots nor songs to slow down the pace of the film. It's actually true that the film is long and slow but after the climax, it's a worth watching experience. After making two films in a row with Rajinikanth, Pa. Ranjith seems to have worked in a film where he doesn't have the need to make it fit a star's image for the commercial viability. His previous films Madras and Kaala dealt with strong political ideologies and caste issues. In Kabali, he spoke boldly about the low-class people's life and their struggles to grow bigger in society. In contrast to these films, he presented only a few political traits this film to bring the feel of the 70s. For example, he used the pictures of notable political leaders of Tamil Nadu to connect the audience with the period of the film. This filmmaking style is unique compared to the other period films that we have seen so far. Pa. Ranjith proves once again that he is a filmmaker who has a vision and a goal to achieve. Through Sarpatta Parambarai, Pa. Ranjith presents the value of relationships: husband and wife, mother and son & teacher and student. He valorizes boxing by giving the sport value. It's not just a sport but an emotion. Overall, Pa. Ranjith's Sarpatta Parambarai is one of the well-made sports drama-packed up with excellent performances and a strong technical crew."

It is not easy to build such a script to catch the audience. But director of this gilm did it nicely.Art directon and make up of artists bring back us to era of 70's and it feels tome that i sit on the front row seat in village boxing circle.Good effort overall."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11580854/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," Spectacular !! ","Pa Ranjith may have had strong politics in all his movies but recent ones were boring, uninspiring and plain emotionless. This is the return of Pa Ranjith who made "Madras".'Sarpatta Parambarai' is not just another sports drama. This has everything needed for a classic film. An underdog who struggled all his life, a coach who believed in him, haters within his clan and the antagonists.Arya does shine in this film as Kabilan, the protagonist who is looked down upon by the society thanks to his caste ( shown symbolically with dialogues and Ambedkar's poster) and his mother's hatred towards boxing that killed his father. As usual, there is a fitness montage and a fat to fit transformation.Pasupathi is at his best in a role that he brilliantly portrayed as Rangan vadyar (coach Rangan). His body language and acting prowess is the main pillar of the film despite Arya being the main protagonist. At times even we join Kabilan's path in finding out what impresses him and what his reactions are. This is the actor we loved in films like Virumandi.Though the main rivalry between Sarpatta and Idiyappa clan, the ultimate fight of Kabilan vs Vembuli being the major plot target, one man that stays in the mind is 'Dancing Rose' the boxer who flies like the wind, flips inside the ring like a capoeira fighter and stands as a true sportsman even criticized his own men for cheating. Shabeer was made to play Rose. This deserves a standalone film.Overall Sarpatta Parambarai is a bit lengthy yet extremely entertaining with proper character depth and strong story."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11580854/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Interesting, but seems like a lost opportunity ","This is definitely a good watchable movie, but feels like it under delivered given the world building and characters the director had at his disposal. The writing and character development is all over the place. Like protagonists who have been staunchly believing in something change their beliefs without any undue reason or logic just cos the story demands it. Arya is great as a boxer and looks the part, but his acting skills when it comes to emotional scenes are found wanting. The rival boxer is just not up to the mark. The best character was dancing rose and that was the best fight in the movie. Definitely watchable, but seems like a missed opportunity to make something even larger and impactful."

It's a teamwork and everybody has given their level best, in particular performances of Arya, Kalaiyarasan, John Kokken and Pasupathy, but standout performer of the entire movie is Shabeer Kallarakkal as Dancing Rose. His mannerisms, reactions and dance steps in the boxing ring still lingering in my eyes, way to go Shabeer and wish you all the very best! Acting of GM Sundar and Vettai Muthukumar is also too good. It's really hard to make period movies like this, thanks to art director Ramalingam for his excellent work and he has brought age old Chennai in front of us. Background music of Santhosh Narayanan is also too good! In the second half there were lots of liquor drinking and violent scenes, could have been better avoided, it slows down the pace of the movie as well, that's the only reason for giving 8 stars, otherwise would have given perfect 10! Wish director Ranjith keeps trying something new like this, as he is very good at it! "

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11581174/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," A monumental achievement for Dhanush, Selvaraj and Tamil Cinema to blend a Superior Social Classic with A Grade Mass Appeal. ","Karnan (2021) : Brief Review -A monumental achievement for Dhanush, Selvaraj and Tamil Cinema to blend a Superior Social Classic with A Grade Mass Appeal. What Asuran Missed, Karnan has got it alright. That aggresive climax which was missing in Dhanush's Asuran has been found here in Karnan. This is how you make a Cult Film with Massy elements. A chunk of Smart Movie Buffs and Art Lovers always complaint about B grade action in South films and their illogical entertainers, i happened to be one of them too. But there are some films which have that cinematic sense which we look for and stars like Dhanush are one of those countable stars who understand this. With Karnan, Dhanush porves his intelligent choice of scripts again and director Mari Selvaraj gets his second consecutive Classic after Pariyerum Perumal. Comparatively, Karnan is better than Pariyerum Perumal. If you have seen that film then you know how big this compliment is for Karnan. Karnan, a fearless village youth, must fight for the rights of the conservative people of his village, due to the torture given by a police officer. It's a soul-stirring fight against the entire system of those suppressed people who have been overlooked by the upper caste people and government for years. Dhanush acts like he's one of those villager who have endiree this torture for years. The supporting cast is fantastic. Screenplay, Dialogues, Cinematography everything hits the high bar. Even the action scenes have A Grade execution which is rare for South films. Selvaraj has done such a great job that i can't tell in words. I would be laughing on the standard of all prestigious awards if this man doesn't get Best Director Award. Yes he is that GREAT! Karnan deserves your watch like you owed it to them and it's like you'll be doing favour for yourself. Hats off to Team Karnan.RATING - 8.5/10*By - #samthebestest."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11581174/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," A powerfully moving film - applause to Mari, Dhanush, Lal, and the entire cast/crew! [+84%] ","Mari Selvaraj makes a bold, powerful statement on caste-based oppression with Karnan - the titular role being played to spectacular effect by Dhanush. If Pariyerum Perumal (Mari's debut flick) can be considered a more subdued attempt, Karnan goes all out in its craft, visual allegories, and (political) messaging. In Karnan, Mari's writing actually gets better. He doesn't shy away from showcasing the dark nature of the plot and the subsequent gut-wrenching violence in all its glory. Even with a host of characters surrounding Karnan, each of them manages to leave a solid mark performance-wise.Yeman, played by a superbly effective Lal, is Karnan's pacifist grandpa who stands against the troubles faced by his fellow villagers but also worries about Karnan's well-being. The village leader refuses to remove the scarf wrapped around his head when a vicious police officer (played by Nataraja Subramanian) demands him to - a move that is seen as servile by upper castes. Karnan's sister is both proud and worried about her brother's revolutionary deeds. Draupadi (Rajisha) loves Karnan to the core, and also stands by him during difficult times. Vadamalaiyan (Yogi Babu) is cynical at first but realizes Karnan's stance was right all along. These are notable names. Mari also conceives impactful scenes with textured supporting characters such as the pregnant woman and her revolting son, the young woman whose higher education dreams are suppressed, the boy who nurtures a horse, and so many more.Karnan's sister, whom we see at the beginning of the film struggling for her life with no one to help, is a constant metaphorical presence within the film. She assumes the appearance of the village deity, symbolizing oppression and ensuing insurrection. Uttradheenga Yeppov is so brilliantly composed (by Santhosh Narayanan and rendered by Dhee) and choreographed in the film, placed at just the right juncture. A recurring visual is that of feet - of different kinds - dusty, wrinkled, battered, bruised, and tied with a rope (the donkey's). The pre-interval sequence sets a chain of violent events in motion. It induced goosebumps and got a long hoot out of me. There's only so much one can bear before they fight back, right?A sense of everyday slowness pervades the film's first half. The writer-director wants to build strong emotional connections amongst the villagers; indirectly between viewers and his characters. The romance isn't the film's core - it often takes a backseat to Karnan's bigger issues, and that (organically) feels like the right call. Mari also uses the village landscape to create resonating imagery - the drylands, the ponds, the thorny shrubs, and what-not. Santhosh Narayanan's background score takes the film to greater, near-mythical heights. That's not to say that Karnan is sans flaws. They're forgivable given the film's intentions and (remarkable) storytelling."

All the characters are well written and have a definite impact. This is one rare movie that explores the other side of vandalism. Though there were countless "hero uplifting the oppressed" movies since the 80s, this movie is miles apart as it is the one rare movie that focused more on the society than the hero. Unbelievable and an impact movie yet again from Maari Selvaraj. I think animal montages will become the signature style of Maari Selvaraj like voice over for Gautam Menon. Must watch!!"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11581174/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," An WONDERFUL Experience. ","Karnan is a story of a youth who can't tolerate any injustice. This story has been shown in many films but what differs Karnan from other films is it's superb execution by Mari Selvaraj. From the opening song of the movie you'll start to feel goosebumps. The film is too long because it started slowly in the 1st half but it became a gripping tale in the 2nd half and then you can't move your eyes from the screen.You'll find many Mahabharat references here but fully opposite way. The animals are used for visual storytelling. The music & specially the BGM is superb. Not just Dhanush but the entire cast did a commendable job. Finally, I can't say Karnan a masterpiece but I'm sure you'll have a wonderful experience.Available on Amazon Prime Video. MandalBros."

Dhanush is too much for this script, new/unkown face could have give more impact on audience, like "Pariyerum Perumal" Its not big action/revenge drama... its the cascading of simple events to the big realisation.... the script also moves around small events and emotions of small village...."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11581174/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Packs a punch! ","#MovieReview #Karnan #Dhanush #Tamil #SpoilerFree #AmazonPrimeWhen the maker of the incredible Pariyerum Perumal combines with Dhanush, a 2-time National Award winner for Best Actor, the audience is well within their rights to expect a masterclass.And the team delivers, to an extent. Dhanush stars as a youngster fighting against systemic discrimination and injustice doled out to his village by authorities as well as a well-to-do neighboring village.In another harrowing and disturbing case study of how a community can be kept oppressed for generations, Mari Selvaraj takes his narrative forward brilliantly, using even the animals on screen to drive home his politics.Despite an intriguing set-up and eye-catching visuals combined with earnest performances from Dhanush, Lal and Yogi Babu, there is a middle portion that was too slow for my taste.The director also failed to leverage Rajisha Vijayan as a performer, giving the Kerala State Award winner for Best actress very little screen time and inconsequential lines.With a run time of 2.5 hours, Karnan will test your patience. But the climax, with an effective culmination of events is well worth it.Recommended."

"," Karnan Movie Review: Mari Selvaraj's Second Film Is A Chilling Wail Against Inaction ","It's difficult to recall many scenes in Dhanush-starrer Karnan that are not punctuated with shots of animals, birds or insects. Even in scenes that depict simple, everyday life in Tirunelveli's Podiyankulam, we find a shot of a fluttering moth, squealing pigs or crawling worms. At first, these 'reaction shots' take a little getting used to. Either in direct conflict or in complete harmony, these non-human 'actors' have a way of pulling us away or thrusting us deeper into Karnan.

This movie neither entertaining nor believable. Which village in India has people fighting with the system for just a bus stop and that too winning in the end. In reality they will completely dissapear from the country. Like the entire country in South too goons are getting tickets for election and not a single actor like Bollywood has guts to raise voice against injustice happening in the country with few in exception. Atleast if they are making such comedy they should cast a healthy hero so we can falsely assume it's justified in reel life. Look at the hero he poor guy look so malnourished he is fit to portray the real suffering farmer of the country. It's sad people still enjoy such stupid trash .

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11581174/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," It's ok movie but lacks sociological and psychological understanding ruining the story ","There is mass element to most Tamil cinema and strong opinionated view towards castesm. They ruined the whole real incident which could have been a genuine story in itself but mixed it up with symbolism muddled it all up and claimed it's good. What it end up feeling is a cooked up story telling out of a real incident.Before adding these issues, there is quote by Gandhi, "Eye for an eye makes the world blind".Now should people be silent in in the situation of oppression. No.. But should a past vengeance grudge or social situation be constantly reminded or used as a means to sell movies and keep the visceral idea of "hatred' bread in the society? Definitely not.You see there is a story arc as well as character arc. In this movie there is only a little bit of any character arc and largely forced character and story arc down to the audience. It doesn't truly makes the villain role any good neither the hero role too. Because of mass nature of the film the hero's character arc gets overshadowed, hidden and villains character development gets so strongly opinionated, muddled and one tone nature and at one time pointless.There is huge lack of psychological, sociological understanding of both character and society which kind of downplays this movie. It's like saying, these people are bad these people are good, and that's it. You aren't given reason like why the hero or villain is so and so and audience intelligence are only feed with already set up idea pushing a thought process sort of blindsided by mass appeal to the movie.For example I gave quote of Gandhi. And Gandhi advocated for nonviolence back in the Brit times, now in today's time should we all say let our soldiers approach nonviolence technique for dealing an attacking enemy? No it's tough. Point being, there is a phase and there are certain nature of human revolution and way of people life style, thinking and so on. It can't be used a means to constantly put people in false perspective or even say one solution for all approach to project an understanding to the viewers.The reason why it heavily missed lack of sociological and psychological understanding is because it comes up with these preconceived notions so strong and it doesn't help to tell a compelling story with the same theme. It loses that opportunity.Though certainly few symbolism are good, but at one point it becomes so obvious and outpouring in each frame just for the feeling of good nature. Be it the small girl wearing the goddess mask or donkey. It's overdone and right in your face which isn't truly good film making. There is no subtle elements to the film or subtext and too easy theme projection because of already views of who, what and how they are.There are so many things which picks up very good and than it's just ends up pointless. Like be it a sport game or love story or childbirth into a conflict. Everything had a great potential, reasoning to help the story to move forward to the final ahaa moment, but it seems so given up midway or false setup.Till half way it had some form of expectation but than it just becomes pointless and boring. Cinematography, BGM, acting for most bits are all good but story didn't had intelligence or true empathetic nature to justify one's transformation. It had a chance to score 7 or even 8, but for fans surely they love each of their favorite hero's acting and performance and it kind of blinds them because fanaticism is as such. It ruins one's mind. But it's upto to people to really get mature now and not take things just for the sake of entertainment but truly as a truth and exploring knowledge too."

Story and screenplay was top notch. Dhanush's lifetime performance. Mari Selvaraj proved once again he is the director who makes a cult. Just go watch it."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11581174/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Karnan is a very strong social issue-based film ","Dhanush & Mari Selvaraj unites for the first time in Karnan. Their previous works Asuran and Pariyerum Perumal were both impactful for their bold and strong content and the way that it has been delivered to the audience. With Karnan, they both step ahead by sincerely pulling off a deeply sensitive social issue on-screen. Well, Mari Selvaraj proves once again that he is a visual storyteller. He uses the brilliant village backdrop, costumes, natural lightings & characters to blend his vision in a well-constructed real world (Karnan's world). Karnan is realism. The film is really hard-hitting and each and every frame would be real. The beauty of the film lies in the visually pleasing cinematography. Mari Selvaraj tells his story with beautiful shots. The angles capture the emotion of each and every character. I would salute Mari Selvaraj for taking up such a serious social issue presenting it in a well-written film. Karnan's major strength is the writing, especially of the characters. Every character has a purpose and a scope to perform. After a remarkable performance in Asuran, Dhanush comes back, even more, stronger than Karnan, an angry young man who is in search of justice for his people. His performance can be easily categorized as one of his best. His intensity in his actions, his braveness in his attitude, and his pain in his eyes reflect the reality of an angry young man. Dhanush's performance is pure and intense especially in the climax which made the film outstanding and even more emotional. Lal's performance needs a standing ovation. I was mindblown by his natural and realistic performance which was the heart and the soul of the film. The rest of the casts including Yogi Babu were exceptionally great. They played a major part in building the so-called Karnan's world. Another major pillar of Karnan is Santhosh Narayanan. His songs are impactful and his background score is pulsating. In fact, his musical score helps the film to be more relatable to the audience. It makes us feel and emote for the characters in the film. Overall, Karnan is a very strong social issue-based film."

Acting of Dhanush, Lakshmi Priya Chandramouli & GM Kumar was too good, also felt like Rajisha Vijayan did bot suit this character, as that character needed lots of nativity.

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11581174/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," Absolutely Brilliant!! ","National Film Award winning actor Dhanush has a special reputation for immersing himself in acting. The same thing in Karnan movie. It is as if no one liked the character of Karna except Dhanush. The warmth of youth and the sense of rebellion were enough to make him bow down. In fact, not only Dhanush but the whole village has done a great job in this movie.The story of this movie based on true events is divided into two parts. In the first part, the director highlights the problems of the village. Even the culture and tradition of the village has come to the fore. Everyone in the village of Pudiyankulam worships the helmet deity. And they believe in all strange practices. For example, one should not mourn or weep over one's death, but should dance and rejoice. Songs and dances try to forget sorrow.And the second episode tells the story of the protest. The story of saving the dignity of the village. How the whole village became the enemy of the administration - all the stories are shown. So, the second episode was very exciting and thrilling. The beginning seemed a bit slow compared to that. The producers took a little longer to spread the net of the story. But can't be bothered.Since this is the story of a very remote area. As well as the story of people believing in a slightly different ritual, so there were many scenes that are not commonly seen. The fighting scenes were provocative on the one hand and frightening on the other. The sound in the follicles has been so good that not the ears; Rather it comes to the heart. The background scoring was also quite good.But I like cinematography the most. Especially symbolic shots. It's very impressive. There are some exaggerated ideas in the story but by omitting them one can be immediately immersed in the story of the film. In a word, the violence and panic shown by the producer without using blood in the fight scene is remarkable. I like it a lot."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11586384/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Brutal and wonderful ","Masking Threshold is one of the stranger films I've seen in some time, almost a YouTube video filled with non-stop zoom-in screens and talking from a person we never see, an IT person (physically played by Johannes Grenzfurthner with spoken performance by Ethan Haslam) who has been dealing with non-stop ringing in his ears for three years. Somehow, someway, he has to make the sound stop. And the theories he comes up with will not only change his view of the world but perhaps even destroy nearly everyone in his world.The film that unspools is the journal of this man, starting as the meticulous work of an investigator who goes mad as the sound keeps assaulting him with medical science claiming there's no cure and any scientists he shares his theories with branding him a lunatic. So he plays into exactly what science believes and gradually goes insane, the screws coming out as we watch along, going through each experience with him before some moments happen that are difficult to face. His fingers smashing an ant starts his detachment and within minutes, he's moved up to slugs, birds and more. Yes, it's just how they claim a serial killer starts to feel no emotion for small animals, but the journey into fringe belief - while doing all your research via the internet and social media - provides a reflection into how Pizzagate - referenced in the film - and Q-Anon can take over the brains of even the most rational of human beings.Beyond the sounds of silence driving the protagonist to find a cure, he's already isolated by being a geek and queer. That means that he has plenty of time to transform his bathtub into a green hell, to order all manner of gadgets, to slowly losing his home to his growing theories.The description of this film claims that it's a chamber play, a scientific dissertation and an unboxing video, but it's also like watching a time-lapse of something - or somewhere or someone - going through the stages of rot.Artist, filmmaker, writer, actor, curator, theatre director, performer and lecturer - Johannes Grenzfurthner is a force of nature. His films Traceroute and Glossary of Broken Dreams were documentaries that have led to this pseudo reality that can only have one violent ending. This may be the most unnerving film that I watched at Fantastic Fest, but it may also be the one that sticks in my head for the longest."

It is fierce, outspoken, harsh, unapologetic.It is clearly a narrative genre film, but it is also highly experimental and not off-putting. The visuals are stunning, and the sound design is divine. Watch it if you dare."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11586384/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," A multilayered macro look at insanity ","MASKING THRESHOLD is a multilayered macro look at insanity itself. A Lovecraftian true maddening turn at obsession to the point of no longer being able to see logic. A Film that truly makes you feel like your are losing your mind by way of masterful audio alone. #FantasticFest."

","A nerd struggles with the world and his own sanity.Clearly a narrative genre film, but also highly experimental and engaging. Stunning cinematography for an indie film, and the sound is divine (or hellish?) Lovecraftian terror done right."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11586384/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Brilliant dive into madness ","Saw this harrowing gem on the virtual platform of Fantastic Fest 2021. Insanity!As far as I interpret this daring indie film, it's a new take on the Lovecraftian diary. A person slowly goes insane, documenting it in a video log, and you can witness his plunge into the abyss of his mind for a solid ninety minutes. Not sure this is already a spoiler, but the entire film is set in one room, and director Grenzfurthner pulls it off like the madman he is.Amazing sound design. AMAZING."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11589366/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Highly enjoyable if slightly flawed supernatural effort ","After a horrific accident in town, a sheriff's attempt to solve the crime turns up empty when several other similar cases also require her attention, eventually leading to the discovery of a malicious native spirit unleashed by a corrupt environmental group and must put a team of locals together to stop it.This one was pretty enjoyable and had some likable aspects. One of the better features here is the setup involving the various storylines in play throughout here. The initial crime and the resulting aftermath leads to a solid investigation setup involving her attempts to cut through the tribal red-tape involving the environmental company in the area and the lack of evidence at the scene which prevents a full closing of the case. As more accidents start occurring and more clues turn up that point to a supernatural entity that the locals are aware of and have a legendary connection to, the connections made here are quite fun and make for an enjoyable storyline. As well, there's a lot to like about the secondary setup that ties the origins of the creature not just into their folklore but gives a lot to like about the motivation for their rampage. The use of Native building and land rights and being screwed out of unfair deals that have finally brought a curse to their community is an exceptionally interesting take and carries some likable storylines. The manner of bringing it out as the method for the creatures' rampage as well as the final method to stop the creature gives this some incredibly creative aspects that are utilized throughout here which are quite nicely explored here. The last positive here is the films' assortment of stalking scenes. Featuring the ingenious setup of working with other senses beyond sight as the creatures' perceived to be invisible, the inclusion of rotten smells and lack of evidence around a corporeal being at each of the scenes is rather chilling which handles the scenes rather nicely. Featuring some nice gore in the scenes as well with the spirit shown to be ripping people open, scratching up the body viciously, or tearing organs out of the body while they're still alive and there's no visual evidence of anything happening at the scene, this features a lot to like about it and holds up the film overall. There are some issues to be had with this one. Among its few flaws is that setting up its complex and involving storylines can make for some rather sluggish pacing at times. The first half here, running concurrently with the investigation of the strange incidents around town, is a slew of scenes involving the life in the town and the citizens that are enjoyable enough but keep the attacks off-screen so it takes a while before anything really happens. This carries on with several other scenes serving no purpose other than to pad out the running time with their inclusion of the day-to-day lives during the search, hampering this just enough to drag the film down.Rated Unrated/R: Graphic Violence and Graphic Language."
