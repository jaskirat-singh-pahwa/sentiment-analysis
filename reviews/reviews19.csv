"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11253090/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","1"," Congratulations Siva and team, you managed to make the Worst Rajnikanth Movie Ever ","This might be somewhat ominous, but I really hope Rajnikanth makes at least one more movie. Because if unfortunately he were to pass away with 'this' being his last film, man what an unfortunately horrible closing it would be.I'll be honest... As someone who very religiously loves the medium of cinema, Siva is a director for whom I have ZERO respect. This is a guy who makes movies horrible enough to set the country back by at least a decade... and that is an opinion I very strongly hold. Siva is the epitome of what's wrong with the Indian cinema industry and why it is (in its mainstream) arguably one of the worst from around the world.I went into this movie (First Day First Show of course) expecting it to be bad. But man, was I in for a shock when I realized that it could not just be bad, but painfully worse than what I had gone in expecting. I don't think I have ever watched a Rajnikanth movie and had the thought of it being the worst Rajnikanth movie ever until today. Not just once, but so many times during the movie, I was trying to compare it with other horrible Rajnikanth movies like Baabaa, Lingaa and Darbar and 2.0.... Nope, this was almost objectively worse in every regard.Everything about the movie was horrible. Sadly enough, that includes Rajni himself. What happened to the dude that he had to entertain this garbage in what is an iconic acting career. Rajnikanth has never been an exceptional actor, but he usually does enough to not let his flaws show. But this movie, just somehow manages to make Rajnikanth look like an absolute joke, and even worse, make Nayanthara and Prakashraj, who are arguably better thespians, look pathetic. I don't care so much for Keerthi Suresh, because prior experiences with her movies have led me to believe that she's just bad at this.The story is beyond parody, the screenplay is over-the-top, the dialogues were painful, the action is lame, the VFX is laughable, the music was intrusive and tasteless and the sentiments (the worst offender of them all) were cringe.Annaatthe is a movie that one should be embarrased to be associated with. This is the type of brain rot that needs to be purged in its entirety from Indian Cinema if it is ever to be taken seriously in the world stage. Unfortunately I don't see it happening very soon, because I'm pretty sure that in a day or two, this review will be drowning amidst a plethora of 10- star reviews from die hard Rajni fans who only care about seeing their beloved superstar's ageing face in bucket-loads of makeup. If you really love Rajnikanth, then it should pain you to see the man taken for a joke. And even though it is unlikely, I hope this movie bombs so hard that Siva just disappears into thin air like the talentless hack he is.I know I'm being extremely condescending in this rant, but that's okay. Because if you're going to defend this movie in any way, then you deserve to be looked down upon. If you love cinema like I do, you should be offended at how horrible this movie is. If you love Rajnikanth, then you also should be equally offended at how horrible this movie is. If you have any respect for quality in storytelling, you should be offended at how horrible this movie is. There is no excuse in 2021 to make a movie as outdated and dumb as this.Shame on everybody involved."

Makes me wonder if the concept of sibling love is too unrealistic that even in reel it doesn't seem convincing.Some parts were entertaining but many others just did not fit well ..so many characters come and go that you almost forget who and why they were there in the first place.The issues the sister character faces in this movie are very realistic and logical but the only way to deal with them apparently is letting your affectionate brother intervene ( note : if u don't have a sibling...u will be stuck with your problems forever)Bottom line : Get a brother before you fall in trouble ..

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11260832/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Bell Bottom is a retrieval for Akshay Kumar and Ranjit Tewari both, for their previous individual blunders. ","Bell Bottom (2021) : Movie Review -Housefull 4 and Laxmii were certainly not the films which should have followed the goodwill of Mission Mangal and Good Newwz respectively. So, Akshay needed a good content film that would bring him back the same status again as a content provider and i am not talking about box office success. Similarly, Ranjit Tewari on the other had a lukewarm debut with Lucknow Central so he was also in need of a good project. Bell Bottom, which is inspired from true events and uses the cinematic liberty for the commercialized vision of cinema, provides that much needed good film to both the people mentioned above. Akshay has already worked in a Spy-escape drama directed by Neeraj Pandey 'Baby' so if we talk about comparisons, then yes, Bell Bottom is nowhere close to it. The director's vision and skills have made a big difference but yes Bell Bottom has its own fun, own thrills, own entertainment and drags too. Technically, it is better than Airlift too but it is just that it arrived 5 years late so lacks that 'somthing new' feel.Bell Bottom is set in 80s and covers the story India's first ever Covet Operation done by RAW. Akshay Kumar plays the titular role which is also his code-name and he's damn personally involved in the operation than as a RAW professional. The entire storyline is very well written. It has slow begining with normal stuff like family drama and love story and then it starts turning red hot with hijack and decision-making scenes. If we can forgive that slow beginning then i guess you would not even realise when the time is passed. It has enough twists in store to surprise you in pre-climax portion and many whistle worthy patriotic scenes too. Sadly, it fails to pack the same intelligent punch in that action-packed climax. It's not about VFX or the visual appeal but it's just that it is not well executed.Acting wise, Akshay Kumar looks fine. He fumbles in the start, in those past days story scenes with the accent and all but as a RAW officer he certainly improves himself. Vaani Kapoor looks beautiful and maybe that's the only reason why she was there. Lara Dutta is unrecognisable in the film but i don't see why is it a big deal? I mean, What is important? To look unrecognisable or to look recognisable to the character you are playing? I choose the latter and so she is strictly average, others might have went crazy for the former one, let them be. Supporting cast is fantastic in their limited screen space which includes Adil Hussain and Huma Qureshi in important roles. Bell Bottom should have been a songless film actually but the filmmaking here was more curved towards commerce than content. Like i said, Baby was Neeraj Pandey's Class, if he was to direct Bell Bottom then he would have made it better than what it is.Technical aspects of the film have made it overwhelming. The cinematography may not be experimental in any sense but it surely captures good frames in traditional manners. The background score is the best part. That theme tone is spine-chilling. That post interval scene when Akshay walks towards the plane and the score goes on loud and camera clicks that Bharat Sarkar logo (Indian Flag) in close view.. Yes, that's where we are supposed to scream. Talking about the direction, it is surely an improvement for Tewari from his previous flick. Though, he misses few things such as cinematic nuances, characteristics, time notes and correct use of cinematic liberty. But i would like to praise him for his twisting and thrilling vision which has made Bell Bottom very interesting. Overall, a Good One and despite hard-core commercial vision, Bell Bottom still finds enough cinematic values that should be noticed.RATING - 6.5/10*"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11260832/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Great Evening's Entertainment ","BellbottomDespite the absurd title that anchor's this movie firmly in the 80's, it was a well placed tense thriller.Akshay Kumar played the central role flitting between obsequious lapdog and macho-Indian-Bond, he was very convincing, what was less convincing was the "ferret-like" moustache that was clipped within an inch of its life that made me smile when he tried to act through it.Whilst a serious subject the movie had some humour, spot the matching male romper suit during the beach scene, or the absurd fight sequence with the Dubai double agent etc.We just had the one tune and it was shorter that usual but I'm giving this a firm 6 outta 10 for delivering exactly what was on the can!"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11260832/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," Worth a watch if you love this genre. ","Bell Bottom is, in short, a gripping action thriller. While the film takes time to cut to the chase, it really holds your attention by the time you realize what you paid for is coming next. It's not flawless, though. The first half is slow and pretty much stretched just to deliver a big bang at the interval, which is a flaw found in most Indian films. The main hijacking sequence ended up a bit unintentionally funny, making me worry if the rest might end up the same way. Further, some romantic songs added to the same question as well as the film's slowness. However, the action was cool and the suspense was breathtaking. The second half clearly outdid the first, cleverly using the Die Hard scenario in an entertaining way. Performance wise it was superb and some of the dialogue was memorable. All in all, a watchable action thriller if you love the genre. It was really good to watch another big scale blockbuster movie from Bollywood. Watching it, however, on Prime Video or at cinemas: that choice is yours."

Airport, scenes like wedding arrangements, conference room have been constructed well.Direction: Average, You don't feel like patiently watching the movie.Acting (& music): Average. Where acting gains a little music loses a little.Final Verdict: Akshay chose a movie which did no good. The movie appears blurred in its final half hour."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11260832/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Retro spy thriller worth a watch ","Bellbottom review :After a limited theatrical release, Bellbottom premiered on Amazon Prime earlier this week. The Akshay Kumar helmed espionage thriller manages to keep you hooked throughout its two hours plus of runtime with hardly any dull moment. If you discount the below par VFX in the climax, of course!!Actually, VFX or other technicalities are excusable if you have a good story to tell. Fortunately, Bellbottom has that. Said to be inspired from true events, the plot revolves around hijacking of an Air India plane by Pakistani intelligence and India's covert operation headed by a super agent known only by his code name : Bell Bottom.The film is fast paced and laced with right amount of humour and emotions. Even the songs dont appear out of place. As aforementioned, the technical aspects could've been much better, particularly that sandstorm recreation at Dubai airport.Undoubtedly, Bellbottom belongs to Akshay Kumar who pitches in yet another brilliant performance. He looks totally fit and agile to play the agent on a perilious duty. Adil Hussain deserves a mention for impressing us even in a small role. His puppy ke "pitaji" wala quote will have you in splits!! Lara Dutta is unrecognizable playing the former PM Indira Gandhi to perfection. Vaani Kapoor leaves a mighty impression as Akshay's wife cum support factor. She not only looks hot and sexy as ever but also conjures an amazing chemistry with the Khiladi Kumar. Here's a pair which should be explored more..Regards, Sumeet Nadkarni."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11260832/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Akshay Kumar yet again takes the mantle and leads from the front ","Bell Bottom is another feasible addition to the emergent list of Indian Spy movies. Through closer inspection, you might find notable parallels with the likes of Baby or Airlift; but let me put it like this, It's under no circumstances attains the stature of those two earlier endeavors nor does it ever aspires to.Although that doesn't necessarily imply it's anything bad per se! Numerous elements had gone in line with the plan and others didn't. As simple as that! For instance; the production value, in general, looks stunning and gives rise to that extra layer of authenticity here. The cinematography is all right, but I do have some reservations about the Score. For which I had a feeling that it became a bit repetitious after a certain amount of time.Speaking of Performances; it's the usual. Akshay Kumar has always been terrific in such roles, and he yet again takes the mantle and leads from the front. Among the supporting cast, one name stood out to me the most. It's Zain Khan Durrani (Who played the role of Doddy, the commander of the hijackers). A gifted individual who needs further opportunities to make headway.My biggest complaint however is about the specific structure this narrative tends to pursue. It's prolonged, takes a huge chunk of time to solidify certain characters, and on top of all that; it doesn't comply with the linearity at all times. There are a bunch of continuity errors, a few traditional flaws, and several histrionic moments that needed a bit of downplaying in my opinion."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11260832/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," Has glaring issues that prevent it from being good ","To me, a Bollywood spy film that succeeded in its execution was Baby. Bell Bottom has its moments and tries to reach the heights of that film but doesn't come anywhere near it.Bell Bottom follows Anshul Malhotra, a RAW agent with the codename Bell Bottom, who plans a covert operation to save over 200 hostages on a plane and capture the four hijackers.Akshay Kumar returns to the spy genre with Bell Bottom. It's hard not to compare this film with Kumar's previous ventures like Baby, Special 26 or Airlift. I'm not sure if it was the intention to feel like a Neeraj Pandey film but that's what it felt like to me. An aspect of Bell Bottom which I really didn't care about was the romance angle with Vaani Kapoor. It's something that didn't need to be included and didn't have any relevance to the main story at hand. Vaani Kapoor does a decent job but I wish she had a role that had more purpose. The motivation behind Akshay Kumar wanting to take on the mission was done in a melodramatic way which is sad as this film could've taken on a more grounded approach allowing the events to feel more suspenseful. The VFX is what really worried me and, unfortunately, they were as bad as expected. The climax is where the special effects looked laughably bad and took away from the tension that was meant to be felt. Clearly more time should've been spent on polishing the VFX. There are also a few fight sequences towards the end which looked fake in my opinion. I also noticed a few small details that ruined the film's quality in my eyes. We see a man getting stabbed in the beginning but no blood is shown on the knife, an obvious plastic baby is used rather than an actual one during one scene and you could even see a Just Eat sign in one shot which doesn't make sense considering the film was taking place in the 1980's.The performances were good throughout. Akshay Kumar has done spy films like this in the past and does a good job. I'm amazed at how good the makeup and prosthetics are on Lara Dutta to make her look like Indira Gandhi and she's good in the film as well. Adil Hussain and Huma Qureshi also do a good job. Zain Khan Durrani was great as one of the hijackers and Denzil Smith feels like a wasted opportunity as he's not given much to do. One of the better parts of this film is the background score. Composed by Daniel B. George, the score brings that sense of adrenaline and excitement for a spy thriller like this and manages to work. The pacing is surprisingly fast and prevents the film from become a snoozefest.Bell Bottom has elements that work well but has glaring issues that prevent the film from being as good as it could have been. There are better films like this in the past that I would rather watch, making Bell Bottom a pretty forgettable film."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11260832/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," It's all in a day's work ","When terrorists hijack an Indian Airlines' flight and steer it to Dubai for yet another round of negotiations with the Indian government for more money and the release of some dreaded prisoners, Anshul Malhotra (Akshay Kumar), a RAW agent who has been waiting in the wings with his analysis, must step up and advise how to resolve the crisis. Initially brushed aside, the bureaucrats slowly start realising that he can add value, Anshul is given a codename Bellbottom and the responsibility to head the rescue mission. But he is on a short leash and allowed very limited time to act, else the bureaucracy shall engage in negotiations with the hijackers to secure the release.What follows afterwards is a race against time with a chartered flight to Dubai, engagement with the Dubai government, the local security team and the execution of a plan that the accompanying Indian ministers are cynical about. But Bellbottom has an axe to grind, for he lost his mother in an earlier hijack and he has discovered that the key hijacker is the same this time too - revenge is in order.Bellbottom is short, exciting and focused. Albeit hugely predictable to the climax, the film is quite entertaining an even manages to pack in some comedy in the beginning to keep matters light. Akshay Kumar is fit, fast and furious and does well to execute the role of an intelligence agent with a plan. Lara Dutta is almost unrecognisable as Indira Gandhi in her brief role. Vaani Kapoor is passable. Anil Hussain, Huna Qureshi and Zain Khan Durrani offer adequate support. But Dolly Ahluwalia is absolutely endearing in her maternal role and makes a heavy impression."

There is no continuity of events.The only thing to my complete surprise was Lara Dutta, simply unrecognizable in her role.Akshay kumar, being him, play every role, make money and that's his formula. No offence but such a hard core son of soil don't carry foreign nationality.Vanni Kapoor Hardly in the movie and please next time when showing a working Indian Woman that too in 80's, check your wardrobe carefully, too expensive taste for a middle class family.

Recommended!"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11260832/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," Engaging Thriller From Akshay Kumar, Made For Big Screen !!! ","In the espionage thriller BELL BOTTOM, Akshay Kumar plays a Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) undercover agent who goes by the code name 'Bell Bottom'. After a plane is hijacked and lands in Amritsar, the seventh hijacking incident in five years, Kumar is brought in to save the day. The film centres around his plans of a daring covert operation to rescue 210 hostages and neutralise four hijackers. The fact that his operation is connected to personal tragedy makes it more impactful.Like several other Akshay Kumar's films that are inspired by real incidents, this Ranjit Tiwari directorial is based on the two events that happened in the late 70s and early 80s during Indira Gandhi's time as the Prime Minister of India. It's commendable that the movie was shot during the pandemic across various locations in India and Scotland.Akshay Kumar's smashing entry as Bell Bottom certainly attracts some whistles and cheering as one can't ignore the fact that he looks dapper at the age of 53. He's slim, fit and agile, and sports a sharp Army-man personality. Bell Bottom who is seen playing husband to Vaani Kapoor is a national-level chess player. He has a sharp memory and is fluent in Hindi, English, French and German. Vaani Kapoor as Akshay Kumar's wife is gorgeous on screen and even with a limited screen time, she supports her character well. The film also stars Adil Hussain, Huma Qureshi and Lara Dutta in pivotal roles. Given the kind of buzz that the film had been generating, mostly around Dutta's make-up, we can certainly say that her makeover as former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi is pretty neat. She is hardly recognisable! Huma Qureshi appears to help the Indian team out while they rescue Indian citizens stuck on the hijacked plane.Akshay Kumar is in full form and dependably strong. He uses his star power to the fullest, with gusto. Portraying Indira Gandhi on screen is no mean feat and Dutta looks confident and convincing in the part. Kumar's mother is played by Dolly Ahluwalia and they share some touching as well as funny scenes together.Written by Aseem Arrora and Parveez Shaikh, the film is engaging and manages to hold your attention for all of 123 minutes. However, you will have to hold on to every minute of the action as it unfolds as there is a lot of back and forth in the storyline. The pace of the film remains steady and the narrative and characters don't lose momentum.While you ride along with the story, the incidents that unfold don't really absorb you emotionally. With a film of this genre, you'd expect a lot of goosebump moments, but this isn't the case. Also, the film leaves you with several unanswered questions, such as the hostages' agony and the terrorists' hijacking plans. The climax of the film is a tad underwhelming and winds up abruptly.Overall 'Bell Bottom' lives up to the charm of a Bollywood, big-scale commercial film that deserved to be released on the big screen. And, of course, the fact that this film marks the reopening of theatres after months of shutdown due to the second wave of the pandemic, moviegoers can treat themselves to a grand cinema experience with this one."

I didn't get the point of casting Lara Dutta and transforming her into Indira Gandhi but she does an okay job. Huma Qureshi is fine with what she's given.The movie is well paced and you can tell they've taken writing inspiration from Argo. What makes you roll your eyes out is random songs and romance dropping in between. Specially the first half. There isn't much action, as the marketing team would have you believe which is why Amazon released a second trailer which was more true to the movie. VFX was just about okay, background score was good except the tragedy theme which annoyingly keeps playing whenever his mother shows up.If you go expecting a movie like Baby you'll be heavily disappointed. There's just little too much political drama sprinkled every now and then. The lead villain isn't that scary, he is almost harmless if you take the gun out of his hand. Infact one of the other bad guy is more fun to watch.So in the end this ends up becoming a movie on RAW. That's all there is. It's not a proper homage, neither a true portrayal of their sacrifice and bravery. Just an average thriller that will soon be forgotten."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11260886/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","3"," Warning: Significant Religious Content ","For some reason there is no mention of this that I can see but an accurate review of this movie should mention its really a "Christian Movie" as in even the dialog is peppered with religious references after the first 10 minutes. Characters are referred to "brother" this and "sister" by the minister father who plays a leading role.The lead actress is pretty good and the supporting cast isn't too bad. For me it got so bogged down in the religious aspects that I couldn't finish it. In the end there is no real plot except to "witness" no us non-believers,The high rating was clearly bid up by believers. Compared to other "Hallmark type" movies it is objectively not very good."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11261830/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Quite enjoyable when it works ","Following the death of his daughter, a grief-stricken priest sets out to seek revenge for the person responsible, eventually finding him in the form of an underground criminal kingpin being sought by a multitude of organizations for his work and must dig deeper into his own resolve to escape the situation.There was quite a lot to like with this one. Among the better features found here is the incredibly enjoyable setup that provides quite a fun setup to the later insanity featured here. The initial setup with the easy-going lifestyle of the priest trying not to get into confrontation or violence and then wretched with grief when his daughter is killed and eventually learning to stand up for himself works rather nicely, while the secondary setup of the need to catch up with the drug-deal gone wrong featuring the criminals scouring their own underworld trying to discover who the psychopath is and what he's done with the money. This gives the film quite a unique setup that brings some rather interesting points along the way. As well, the film manages quite a lot to like with the brutal and over-the-top confrontations with the killers coming into play. With the strong opening about the girls being stranded in the van and then finding the attempted saviors getting dispatched gruesomely before the graphic final scene, this one manages quite a lot to like almost immediately in a fast, frenetic sequence. The car chase and resulting accident that sets this one in motion are quite thrilling, and the relentless attacks that come about in the finale where the freed prisoners are let loose bringing upon a ton of frantic, furious sequences together as they attack the group in the underground dungeon and eventually make their way out into the woods which features all sorts of impressive effects-work on the graphic kills throughout here, giving this some likable features. There are some flaws to be had with this one. The main problem is that so much of the film's first half is so generally unappealing as a horror film that it's easy to think this one doesn't even fall into the genre. The opening attack is very misleading to the later scenes as the main setup that gets focused on the search for the figures in the criminal underworld that revolve around the killer that kills his daughter than it is about the deaths being dished out. This plays far more like a crime thriller than a genre effort with the way the scenes play out as the drug deal gone wrong involving the brutal murder of the courier which is not that interesting or features anything remotely close to what's going on later on in the film so it just isn't that good to get started. That early setup highlights the films' other issue in that there's such a pronounced and obvious stylistic change between the first and second half that is awkward and clumsily put together. The sluggish pacing from the non-genre first half gives way to a furious, fast-paced second half that's quite different not just in style but also in presentation. There's so little about what's going on here that feels cohesive and connected to what's come before it as the turn from crime thriller to horror is not that well-defined and comes out of nowhere with how it's played off. The shift in tone is drastic much like the content of the action featured here which all combine together to knock this back a bit.Rated Unrated/R: Extreme Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Nudity, and heavy drug use."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11263022/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," Don't expect too much from this generic exorcism movie... ","Well, as I sat down to watch the 2021 horror mystery "The Seventh Day" I must admit that two thoughts went through my head. The first thought was with a cast that included both Guy Pearce and Stephen Lang then of course I would be in for a good movie. And my second thought were this will probably be yet another dubious exorcism movie.Yet, I still opted to sit down to watch "The Seventh Day" from writer and director Justin P. Lange. And yes, "The Seventh Day" was certainly watchable, but that was about it. It was not an overly great movie, despite of having a nice enough twist to the storyline.Nay, the movie just suffered from being a bit too monotonous. There wasn't enough pacing to the storyline and what did happen throughout the course of the movie just felt somewhat generic and not overly interesting. And that, ultimately, made "The Seventh Day" into a less than mediocre movie experience. Sure, there were aspects of the storyline that proved to have potential, but writer and director Justin P. Lange just didn't fully cash in on these and take full advantage of the material readily at hand."The Seventh Day" felt monotonous and sort of lulled me into a dull sense of stupor, as there wasn't a whole lot of things going on throughout the course of the movie. Yet, I managed to endure this to the very end. But, alas, I wasn't overly impressed or overly entertained by what transpired.The acting performances in the movie were okay. Sure, I had expected more from Guy Pearce, but Stephen Lang was hardly in the movie at all, which actually was a shame.All in all, then "The Seventh Day" is not a movie that enrichen the horror genre, nor is it a particularly outstanding foray into the demonic possession and exorcism subgenres. The things that transpire in this movie is basically something that has been seen and done in other movies, more often than not, also done better in other movies. So this is not a revolutionary movie in any way.My rating of "The Seventh Day" lands on a four out of ten stars, as it was somewhat of a disappointing movie."

Sometimes they do detective things, sometimes we get the horror cliches inserts, there are also weird slasher segments from like Halloween or even Alien. The whole possession thing is also taken by the priests as a daily routine, the attitude was kinda similar to Constantine, but this is a big credit given to the Seventh Day. I also have no idea about the significance of the title in terms of the story. I hoped that this would've been more like thematical, good virtues vs. Evil ones, but no.Don't get me wrong, it's ok to try to move from a basic exorcism story. But in this, the execution is all over the place. It just doesn't hold, the story doesn't feel thought out, they just jump around a lot. What doesn't help is that it is also totally divorced from reality.Yet the biggest problem for me was the protagonist acting. I know he was supposed to be fresh green, but come on, how can you root for an exorcist who gets scared to death by a kid talking funny.The only saving grace in this was Guy Pearce. Also, the title soundtrack was very familiar, I'm 100% sure I've heard it before. Stephen Lang was miscast though, this is not his material.The 'twist' is obvious from the start so it's not really a twist. I mean, how can anyone be surprised by this. And the ending is just copy-pasted sequel bait.Recommendation: just watch 'The Rite' (2011)."

How many times do we need to see a kid strapped to a bed speaking in "demon voice?" How many times do we need to see a priest who is full of doubt? Or the black eyes of the possessed?Guy Pearce is a foul-mouthed priest - world-weary at the sights he's seen. Disheveled, slovenly - but super really great at finding evil and getting the evil out and stuff.He's been assigned a new partner for finding and fighting the evil. The New Fish is fresh out of the Exorcism Academy, where he did great at all his exams and got his certificate. Think buddy cops...grizzled old vet and inexperienced rookie. Problem is, the new guy is a such a wet-blanked. He speaks slow, has zero energy, doesn't know what evil is and is so utterly unengaging as a main character.No real attempt is made to explain anything; our evil fighting duo head to a homeless encampment - why? Because Guy said so...if you're thinking "dang, that's random." You wouldn't be alone. There they meet the soup lady who wanders away they find and some homeless dude, their target. Guy instructs new guy to say a prayer at the confused and angry homeless man...new guy, recalling the PowerPoint class on prayers demons hate, begins to recite the prayer...soon soup lady shows up. Surprise! She's the demon and next thing you know...a tent blows away.It was a fun scene...it didn't make sense, but still.Act 2 and 3 deal with a kid who killed his family. Amusingly, the rookie has the ability to see the past - or time-travel - or talk with ghosts. Who knows. His ability wasn't mentioned prior. I'm okay with suspension of belief...but I have my limits.My breaking point: At one point the rookie calls up a senior priest to tell him he's having serious doubts about being an exorcist. The priest on the other end of the call says some ominous mumbo jumbo like "soon, you'll understand, soon it will all make sense," then he laughs in that evil way you do and hangs up.With that, the rookie miraculously puts it all together and we all arrive at the most ridiculous twist that makes no sense at all.Despite the plot holes, this was close to being watchable. For me, the performance of the rookie was unforgivable. He's supposed to be the hero who saves the day. It would have been better if he slowly pieced together clues that led to the twist...but instead we get this milquetoast mop.I can't recommend this.Cheers."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11263022/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," Very good indeed ","This film was great!It broke the mold of many Exorcism films.Unlike the original Exorcism film of the 70s and the many that imitate it, rather than staying put in a single room the two protagonists move around a good deal.They have Church sanction for their actions.At first, Guy Pearce trains his younger partner.But when he's up to speed, he throws him into the fires.And then things get really weird.No spoilers!!!!Except to say, nothing is as it seems.Terrific film.A must see!"

I've never seen anything else he's done, but he's one of the most boring actors I've seen to date. The story itself was also dreadful. This can replace your Ambien if you have sleeping problems."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11263022/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","3"," Mediocre waste of a good idea ","Not much to praise this movie for, except competent acting from all the cast and a refreshing twist to the whole exorcism thing. But this refreshing idea turns out to be completely wasted in a subpar script that seems to be too afraid to take it further, and instead turns this creative idea into a lame plot twist that anyone can see a mile away.This new take on the exorcism theme could have been used to create a really awesome story and a memorable movie. Not this time."

","4 out of 5 stars.It is a strong emotional journey about a coming of age story when a young teen has a seizure. To only find out he has a tumor. It can be removed in his brain but it will have complications that will take away his hearing. He decides to plan a road trip and make a playlist of sounds along the way. Which he runs into Wendy (Madeline Brewer) which she is also on the run to new york. They both go together. Making memories and recording sounds.The plot is good. Cute and emotional. Keean Johnson and Madeline Brewer did a fantastic job with there characters. The idea of losing hearing is tough. The noises of music. Nature. Voices and so much more taken away can be scary. The movie does not into that teen romance cliche. Which is a good thing. But the chemistry of the two characters is sweet and perfecr when they are on screen.Great cast. Fun direction and music score. The plot is good with an emotional characterization. It is definitely worth checking out."

","The beginning of this has some fun High-Fidelity-lite vibes before sinking into teen melodrama for far too long during the road trip section, co-starring a manic pixie dream girl that's more annoying than appealing. While it ended up being more John Green than Nick Hornsby, the last 20 minutes turned it around, making some brave narrative decisions that give it more credibility than it earned through the middle section."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11268742/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," What You'd Expect ",""Sound is my escape and it is something bigger than myself."Welcome to January Movies! Today we have...a cheesy teen movie about someone who has a few days before a surgery concerning an illness!Marcus, an audio-obsessed high school senior, learns he must undergo brain surgery that will render him deaf, and decides to seize control of his fate by recording the Ultimate Playlist of Noise. The Ultimate Playlist of Noise is something I was told to watch because it was above average. I wouldn't say this is bad, but it's nothing we've seen before. The movie is predictable in setup. The characters' personalities aren't anything new from normal. Marcus made me feel conflicted at times. He plays everything cool but also nerdy at the same time. I felt like it needed to be one or the other dependent on the current situation. As he and Wendy go on this trip, there are some entertaining scenes. It's not overly funny and knows that it's not trying to be hilarious. Towards the end, I will say there's an emotional scene and an effective approach concerning his state of health. There's not much to say about this because it's pretty average. I will say I do have some beef with the factual information of it. Since he has a brain tumor, he's supposed to lose all of his hearing after the surgery. Where it's located wouldn't have caused this to happen, if I'm correct. Also, before the surgery they shave that area of his head but in the next shot it's obvious that they didn't. Then after the surgery they show the bandages on the opposite side. I feel like those last two things should've been easily acknowledged while making it. That just bugged me. Anyway, it's not bad, but I'll probably forget about it by the end of the year."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11268742/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","1"," A waste of time ","The ending isnt good and the movie isnt fun or anything good. I wish I had skipped it."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11268742/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," An effective rollercoaster of emotions. ","The Ultimate Playlist of Noise uses sound design in a really interesting way. What the film achieves with sound is pleasing and visually feel good too. It's one of the most brilliant aspects of the film Keean Johnson gives a strong and believable performance as Marcus and while the plot occasionally slows to a snail's pace, his interest in experiencing the sounds of the world during his "Going away party" for his ears keeps things fresh. There is so much more to life than the small corners of existence we live in and this film paints that reality with both tremendous empathy and a bluntness that lesser writers and directors would avoid. With fine performances from all actors and some beautiful cinematography and sound mixing, "The Ultimate Playlist of Noise" has a lot of good reasons to watch it and a comforting overall message. But with a plot that draws instant comparisons to similar stories that are more memorable like the sound of Metal, it's destined to be forgotten. Anyways, it's a heartwarming choice if you're looking for a new release to get your emotions going."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11268742/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," A PROFOUND REMINDER TO REALLY LISTEN TO WHAT I HEAR ","I was charmed by this story and especially by it's central characters! Marcus' Playlist took me back through my life to remember and really appreciate many of my favorite sounds. The message for me was to pay attention to everything in life as it happens instead of succumbing to distraction. Focus and BE HERE NOW as Ram Dass said. I loved this so much I'll buy the DVD!"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11268742/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Lovely and enjoyable ","The movie portrayed a beautiful journey along with a harsh situation for the main lead to deal. It is not a romantic movie but it would be a lot sweeter with a little romance. Overall 1/2 for story. 1/1 for plot setting. The direction and cinematography is good but something could have been done to make the watchers more involved with the life of the main lead. 1/2. I really enjoyed this movie and give 1.5/2 from myself and 1.5/2 for the actors. They did some good work in this emotional rollercoster movie."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11268742/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","2"," A mess ","This film is a complete waste of time. The plot line doesn't make any sense and the characters are boring. So much is going on, they try to explain everything for no reason. Everything bad happens to the main character and somehow he is extremely dull and you can't connect to him. We've seen this type of movie a hundred times but this is certainly the worst one."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11268742/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Not Bad for a January Release! ","I am sure that I am going to like this film far more than the average viewer as it touches home. I am a musician, and music has played a huge role in my life. I inherently connected to this character before the story began. As the story went on, I found myself laughing at the titular playlist because some of my favorite sounds were on it, and I have literally thought about the emptiness their absence might bring. Had the film left it at that, and really explored the character's fears and reservations about his new life, I think that it would have been more impactful than the conflict that is introduced. I think that there is something in this film that everyone can enjoy!"

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11268742/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Enjoyable movie, but I feel let down ","I really enjoyed this movie. It made me feel laugh, smile, and cry. I really enjoy Marcus, the main character, and I found him quite relatable. I enjoyed watching his journey.My big complaint is.. he just never sees Wendy again? He was falling for her, she sends him back his tape recorder with the message, and that's it? That was great and sweet and all.. but I was really hoping they'd continue being friends and hanging out after his surgery. Heck, I was rooting for them to get together. Maybe I'm too much of a sap.Overall, a good movie with lots of emotions."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11268742/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","2"," The Wrong Type of Noise ","I thought this was going to be a movie about someone making a harsh noise playlist. Not super thrilled with what I got. It's not terrible, but a little Merzbow would go a long way.I am aware that a mainstream movie that heavily features harsh noise would be basically unwatchable to a large swathe of a standard audience, and it's not really feasible to expect something like that. But like, that could be a pretty cool movie, just some pretentious teen building their ultimate noise playlist, and everyone just not getting it, which only reinforces their feeling of isolation, further feeding back into their desire to seek alternative media.Anyway, this movie failed to meet my expectations, which today I'm going to say is their problem, not mine."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11268742/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Great story about things people might go through ","I enjoyed this movie a lot more than I expected. It gives you a glimpse of what some people might go through in their lives. And in this specific story, they cannot control what happens to them. They lose the most important things in their life but they also get to experience life without the original things they love and start to realize there is beauty everywhere in their own ways.There were some parts where I started tearing up a little. There were scenes where it gave me a good laugh. A whole slew of emotions throughout this movie.Though some parts had me drifting off since I was not too immersed into the movie at first."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11268742/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," Amazing heartfelt movie ","I honestly loved every minute of this movie. The lead actor pulls you in with a sincerity and innocence to his character. You feel everything he feels. If I could purchase this movie I would."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11268742/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," It was a good movie ","Some people may say this movie was cliche and like stuff we've seen before but, I think it was actually pretty good. It was a relatable movie and it dealt with lots of emotional moments such as his brother's death/why he died, mental health issues, to always look at the bright side of life and of course when he lost his hearing. Overall I thought it was a good movie."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11268742/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","3"," The choice of actors is a disaster ","Although the subject of the film is attractive and emotional, but the actors of the film play very badly and without feeling."

","Im a grumpy old man, that has been working in a 95% female environment all my life as a nurse, ''boy youre too girlie girlie'' theyve sung for me, even though ive always tried to keep a low profile, and have therefore, i guess, avoided what we all know as feminism, and all that it stands for. But according to this well filmatographicly made stub of motionpicture, i have my doupt to the feminism-topic. Is it really as bad as this in 2021? Is it really necesarry to make such movies today? What will it gain? Who is the core audience to this murderous female campaign, that starts up with a pusnished girl that creeps into a pandoras box( still profoundly in love with pandora) waking up in a fog of war, supposedly 2nd world war, where the main purpose is killing men...!?I shall not elaborate or spoil the fun for the ultras, but i think this movie is 50 jahre spaet gemacht, the war on feminism is merely over, the battle is almost won, and as the counterintelligence says its going to become like a paradise in the years to come, cause theyve invented the new version of the atomic bomb, namely the #metoo threat that hangs over each and every man every hour, minute or second of the day.So i might be a silly grumpy old man that love to break even with everyone and loves to watch quality filmatography, which there are lots of in ''mayday'', and i might as well deaclare the start of a new movement to protect myself from the wave of criticism that will come outta this review, namely #mentoo, cause its not that easy to be a man after all. So my final conclusion is i saw, became bored and fell of and still threading the water..."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11271800/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," Novel, minimalist approach to feminist drama ","The movie opens with Ana (Grace Van Patten), a young waitress being treated quite harshly in several ways, including the most personal. She opens an oven door to discover a Narnia-like portal to another realm. But this one's a grim war zone, in which she joins a few other women living in a bunker, and learns to fight the male armies around them. Her situation is rather vaguely defined. Is she dead? Is she dreaming? Is this a true alternate universe? The tale unfolds with Ana gaining skills and confidence as she bonds with the others. Her journey begins to seem more akin to The Wizard of Oz, with abuse playing the causative role of Dorothy's tornado.We watch the quartet of young kindred spirits employing several tactics for bumping off the males of the surrounding armies and navies, including the eponymous distress signal. We also watch Ana's determination and coping abilities blossom in that barren, post-apocalyptic setting. Eventually, the war begins to seem endless and pointless, spurring her to take the initiative and alter her path.The production is quite minimalist in every respect, from locations to costumes and cast size. Much is achieved via communications with offstage voices in the gloomy, gray exteriors, and even darker interior sets. It's a message film that winds up being anything but subtle, with little joy for its principals along the way, other than a whimsical musical sequence in the latter half.The premise and tone from writer/director Karen Cinnore are relatively unique, which makes this film intriguing. The same can be said for Van Patten's performance as she evolves under duress."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11271800/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","1"," Just so bad ","I despise gratuitous violence and this movie seems like someone really hates men. The idea of a war of women against men could have had an allure, and even satirical possibilities but I didn't like it."

Just when you thought Hollywood couldn't manage to make movies any more political then they already are...they somehow manage to do it! This is not a good film. It's not because of the lesbian love sparks, nor is it the rough and tumble macho females acting strong. No it's pretty much the terrible writing in this film. I can just see how Hollywood execs approved this film project featuring brave independent women hunting men down in a WW2 scenario film penned as a groundbreaking feminist storytelling the likes of which the silver screen has never seen before!This dud of a film will be forgotten fast and dropped immediately into the bargain bin at Walmart the day it's released on DVD. Don't even bother wasting any time on this dumpster fire. 3/10."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11271800/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","3"," Women on the warpath ","Although the first half hour is attractive in the development of the mystery and confusion it causes in the viewer, from the moment that the director has no intention of giving explanations, you must assume this world of female soldiers in constant warfare. As Alice falls into the rabbit hole, Ana is introduced into this world through an oven and then we witness a simplistic and childish game of misandry."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11271800/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," LOST? MeToo ","The acting's great, as is the cinematography (and CGI). There are a lot of good things about this film, it's certainly not misandrist. You'd have to miss the whole point, or at least 70% of the run time to interpret it that way.I want to say Soko did particularly well in this but I think I'm just overhyping her in my head after seeing her utterly incredible performance in The Premise. The whole cast did great here. It's nice to see Juliette Lewis again.But the film IS a slow burn. It takes a long time to feel invested in the plot. Is it worth it? Hard to say. Maybe it would be better as a shorter film, maybe that would ruin the pace of the character development. I have no simple answers. I couldn't do better.The one thing that did rub me the wrong way was the "abuse". To illustrate how bad it was there was a lot rushed in a very short time which made it a unreal (not that bit, all of it) especially the line about how much of a chore it is to look at Grace van Patten's face. That takes more suspension of disbelief than the dance.All in all I didn't enjoy it and slightly resented the sunk-cost-fallacy need to finish watching beyond a certain point. I believe it's a very good film. It's not for me, as an audience, but I can see this being incredibly powerful for people who can relate to Ana. My congratulations to everyone involved, you've made something to be proud of that may well help countless people in ways you'll never get to hear about."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11271800/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," Different ","If you look behind the feminist men killing frenzy there's a beautiful movie. Well acted, good soundtrack, nice and artistically shot. If you are a victim of hollywood standardization however you might not like the plot as it leaves quite some room for your own interpretation which means you have to use your brain and some people are not used to it anymore ;) well done! Took me by surprise as it starts quite slow. You have yo give it some time to settle though."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11271800/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","1"," Just a misandrist fantasy by a 'Karen' ","The film is just about killing innocent men who the protagonists don't even know about. The reason they do it is because they were treated badly who has same genitals.Every evil person has a terrible history, but that doesn't justify why the person should be evil. The main characters simply murders the people who came to save them. The misandrists are portrayed as charismatic and heroic instead of evil. The film just end by the character Ana derails the idea of murdering the men who they don't know about, that's it."

The negative,one-sided view of women made the movie less enjoyable or realistic.I loved that the aunties welcomed Ali and gave him a safe place even though they practically robbed him on his first day in town.I wish they would have shown Ali meeting his extended family of half sisters and step father. It would have been healthier to show blended families from around the world.Good movie, but so much room for improvement. Dear Netflix, English dubbing would have helped too.

I thought this movie would give me a really good chemistry between Ali and the queens (aunties) because the title of this movie is Ali & the Queens. Turns out it's just so so. I can't feel anything. The ending part when Ali gets scholarship is nonsense.2. I thought this would be a great comedy movie with their great actresses who played the Queens, but their role is not highlighted as much as I expected.3. I hope Iqbal, who played as Ali will improve his acting skills. I feel so cringe at some of his scenes. His acting is lack of emotion. You can do better Iqbal, I believe that.4. The last thing that makes me feel annoyed is the cinematography. Their shooting technique doesn't help at all to support the atmosphere in the story sometimes.5.

When I first saw the advertisement, I was intrigued by the overall concept of it. The aunties (ratu-ratu queens) have different personalities and interesting dynamics with eachother and I personally loved them. As an Indonesian, Ali's life back in Indonesia hits home to me and the contrast of it with his home in New York is interesting. I mostly laughed at the straight forward auntie's lines (forgot her name). Despite all this, the movie could've been better if Ali's character was more fleshed out. I'm not sure if the problem was with the writers or the actor at executing Ali's character. If Ali's character had more depth to him, then it would definitely hit the audience's heart more when bad things happen to him."

You won't feel connected with the character because there was not much given for us to understand either of them. And the acting was....my god...terrible! Except for Biyah and Party. The movie also didn't show us what Ali's mother relation to Party. It's like watching a movie with characters that are there just because they are scripted to be there. As an example Ali's mother went to New York to chase her dream just because the script writer wrote her to. We weren't given much background on how and why this dream NEEDS to be chased. Not to mention the forced comedy! Ugh!The adventure feels that was portrayed in the movie description, ZERO! The movie makes it soooooo easy to find a person in NEW YORK!Seriously, a heavily sponsored movie like this should have been produce better.."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11271990/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," Great Potential but not a practical Moral story ","Well I watched the movie on Netflix few days back .I would highlight the cinematographer and the editer has not done a good job of bringing the emotions out of the characters .. camera was so wayward it seemed like captured using a Mobile phone .Even the camera did not pan towards the characters during dramatic scenes.I found it strange how Ali would develop a total disregard for people who took care of him during 15-16 years of his life and develops a bond strong for people he just met.It does not happen Untill Ali is a thankless person.Many movies have such scenes where main character does go the other way but then they r not portrayed to be innocent .Morally not so much to influence younger generations here as it won't stand a chance to sway some kid to leave his loved ones and meet and stay with them forever .Impractical is the best I could say."

I don't find a very satisfying answer through the film."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11271990/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," Great idea poor execution ","This movie has a great premise even though it's pretty similar with the DC movie Shazam, but had some problem.First, i dont really care about Ali character, it obviously underdeveloped from the start, i dont know him as a character unless a boy who love drawing and lost his mother. I dont find the urge to why Ali need to find his mother, despite he lost his mother (physically), i dont see it like he lost the family as a whole.Second, the Queens gang are just annoying to Ali, i dont see it as a family replacement quality, the way Ali come back to the Queens after they ask Ali to come back to his homeland is just weird and make the ending less impactful.Third, the mother motivation throughout the movie was bad, and treated us as a viewer like an idiot, who just approve anything without anything.This movie has a lot of potential, i know what the writer want to tell us but didn't executed well."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11271990/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," Good premise but terrible execution ","I think the premise of the movie is interesting, a son searching for his mother in another country can be a great movie. You can explore their emotion, relationship, cultural difference, and many more. But this movie hasn't explored this potential.I have to compliment them in production design and cinematography, it's a lot better than other Indonesian movies. And I think this movie isn't just using new york as eyes candy like some older Indonesian movie, new york has a part in the plot. And I like the chemistry between the ratu ratu queens even if sometimes it feels exaggerated.The plot is really basic and left a lot of context. The plot feels like a lot is missing, especially the main plot including the mother. Also, the acting couldn't help carry the script, in my opinion, the main character is very wooden, I cant feel the emotion in his acting and can't take him seriously, I like some of the actors' acting like the mother and girlfriend. And some of the plots aren't realistic, like Ali getting a visa to us easily, he got a scholarship in us easily, and many more. But you know it's just a movie :) Overall it isn't a great movie, but it's good enough to watch on Netflix if you don't have anything to watch 5/10."

","With Cine-Excess 2019 being the first film festival I actually attended, (where the late Norman J Warren was a fabulous guest.) I signed up straight away when I discovered a second online version of the festival was being held. Noticing that this had the shortest run-time of the films in the line-up,I got set to pop a pill.View on the film:Going behind the camera for the first time since the short movie What Came After (2016), costume designer/production designer/ writer/director/lead actress Tonya Pinkins is joined by cinematographer John Hudak Jr. In gathering the nine "Progressives" inside a isolated rural house filled with glossy whip-pans that slide between merry exchanges with the pals and iffy CGI jump scares.Cutting to grainy CCTV footage of the friends being secretly recorded, Pinkins unveils distorted glimpses into Folk Horror, before shooting it down for a dire, flatly shot ending clearly based on The Handmaid's Tale TV series.Entering a "red state" on the eve of the election, the screenplay by Pinkins disappointingly fails to give any of the friends major distinctive differences,with attempts at satire landing with a thud as they all agree on everything,and the baddies being given so little room to create an impression, that the twist ending comes off as a badly judged wacky final note,as the red pill turns blue."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11279862/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," Wicker Man meets Get Out! ","Red Pill is the most satisfyingly unnerving and terrifying combination of Blair Witch Project, the original 1970's Wicker Man, and Get Out -- with surprise dashes of Sesame Street and Big Brother thrown in there! A diverse group of artistic and intellectual New Yorkers (all extremely attractive and casually/refreshingly well past the age of 40!) travel upstate together from the city on a mission to canvas for the upcoming presidential election. Things immediately get uncomfortable as conflicts about race and gender threaten this group first from within their thoughts and conversations and then from outside and all around the charming house they have rented in the country. A real horror movie emerges, always with unwavering undertones of the real-life horrors of systemic and inherited racism and privilege yet not too high tone to deliver some serious suspense and gore. All of the performances from the 6 leads are committed and believable, even in the extraordinary situations in which their characters find themselves. This movie is a treat that will poke and challenge you and your ideas about race in the most thrilling way!"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11279862/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," Red Blood in the Soil ","There aren't dead spaces in this film. The viewer is either scared or anticipating feeling scared. The film begins with the illusion of comfort. We see aerial shots of a beautiful Virginia countryside in the fall season. The comfort turns to discomfort as we face death, desperation, and confusion with the characters. I don't want to tell you the story. I want to tell you the significance of this film. I understand that fans of Jordan Peele's "Get Out" will venture to see this film. But keep in mind that this is a flick for horror fans but much more. Red Pill brings in contemporary and historical themes including White women and Black women with issues of betrayal, Trumpism, and Black solidarity, while pushing in glimpses of enslavement of Africans. From 1619, there has been red blood in the Virginia soil from enslaved Africans. How fitting that the film connects horror with realistic fiction."

By the final, terrifying montage, I found myself reflecting on all that I had just seen."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11279862/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," Somewhere you never expected to be ","Tonya Pinkins' horror-film/reality show RED PILL will take you somewhere you never expected to be, but of course you have been there already. And as you watch, something keeps tugging at you, "Don't go there, don't go there!" but it's only a movie, so maybe you can have a few screams and then it's over. Or not.The movie opens with a glimpse of terror that primes you dreadfully, but it then proceeds to be what a comfortable group of friends treat, at first as a socially conscientious vote-canvassing outing into rural Virginia mere days before the 2020 presidential election. They have rented a house that of course becomes the scene of their hideous demise.The unexpected: One of them is... a "red pill," explained by Pinkins' character, Cassandra, thus: "Somebody who infiltrates a group in order to destroy it from within."Foreboding makes itself visible in fits and starts as the tension builds; the viewer knows this cannot end well. Cassandra (a worldly Black woman) leads the group in identifying the fear at every step, but they good-naturedly reassure her to relax; they are safe, jovial friends on a woke mission, after all. "Wherever you go, that's where you are," her friend Rocky (Rubn Blades) advises. But that is the problem!The scariest thing about this movie is also the most familiar, the most normal, mundane, and the most undeniable: for a Black woman, the monster hides in plain sight and even mocks you. And until the first actual murder takes place ("What's HAPPENING?" rings out from one of the trapped cohort) the juxtaposition of ordinary everyday life and inexorable looming unimaginable terror presents the actual atmosphere of the white world that African Americans must navigate in the 21st Century. The barbecue grill is always stored in the barn... right next to the noose.With a rare artistry for horror films, Pinkins has evoked a world where you must laugh as the chains rattle. The movie has its full complement of bone-shaking screams and gasps of agony but as the characters scramble, shriek and cower as they try to evade their grim fate, you can also feel a full-throated resistance to the inevitable monstrosity: yes, this is where we live, and we do live, so long as we can.I always watch movies with the goal of figuring out the ending well before it becomes manifest. I had to give up on that, this time. If you are Black in America, or if you live in and care about America, take a deep breath and watch RED PILL, at least once. (For me, it took more than one viewing.) Although the truth will not set you free, it will appear in big red letters."

The use of cult- like rituals and witch like ceremonies got me...especially the parts using bodily fluids! The subtle hints at WHO might be the infiltrator were not lost on me and this was an interesting abs creative way to display the hurdles black and brown folks still encounter TODAY along with what allyship and friendship can look like - imperfect and flawed and creating harm, despite "good intentions"."

Rich with metaphor, satire, and the merging of history with contemporary issues, Red Pill breaks the mold of horror filmmaking. The multicultural cast of award-winning actors delivers nuanced and scintillating performances. Codified with sociocultural and political references, and teeming with symbolic imagery, Red Pill is a poetic feast. A brilliant and iconic work of art, Red Pill evokes conversation on issues critical to American history. Cutting edge and courageous filmmaking. Fantastical. Intellectual. Sophisticated.

This breakout film was written, directed. and produced by the supremely gifted Pinkins, who stars alongside a talented cast who will have you clutching your seat (when you're not jumping out of it!). The pacing, flow and unrelenting creepiness (terror) keeps you engaged from the very first moment the six friends arrive at their rental house in a small Virginia town.With Red Pill, Pinkins carves out her own niche in the horror genre. This a multi-layered, multi-dimensional thriller that hits all the right horror beats while artfully presenting a political, philosophical and even spiritual meditation on the current racial divide in this country.Pinkins makes the viewer see (and feel) what could happen if today's political climate continues to spiral out of control. Is it possible for the world to become this truly terrifying place, one where white supremacy has totally destroyed people from the inside? What happens when whiteness is weaponized? It is a dark vision of what might be. It'll wake you up.This is not to say this is an overly political film with a didactic message. Not at all. Pinkins takes us on a wholly entertaining, scary-as-hell, emotional ride that leaves you wanting to watch it again, to peel away the layers, and to wonder what will become of Cassandra at the hands of Red Pill.A powerful directorial debut - bold and brave. Go see it. Be prepared to scream!!"

","I'm not a fan of horror films; there's enough horror in the world and this genre causes me so much anxiety. I watched Red Pill because I am such a Pinkins fan. It stunned me that this film was something of a cross between a great art house film and a scary but rivating commentary on the extremes of racism in America. What I found most interesting were the stretches of dialog that addressed so many realities of that racism. I have to applaud, as well, the reversal of roles, turning the white guy into the icky, misogynistic product of white supremacy. Nothing could be clearer on the whole history of this country than this film. And, yes, it was scary af! This is what a film by a Black writer/director can be when there are no whites to put their I-know-better-than-you-how-to-tell-your-story spin on it. Please, let us see more films by Black writers, directors, and producers."

This is so much more than the genre "horror film" suggests. It's smart and political. The entire cast was perfect. Perfect. Great performances. The tension. I screamed out loud so many times. The co-opting of the two white women friends at the end . THAT is the real horror. I don't dare wear red lipstick again. the DP is terrific. Just gorgeous production values... color is stunning.

It is the nightmare we still can't wake up from. A collection of relatively ordinary people who want to improve their world drive into the rural South to Get Out the Vote before the 2020 election, and they walk right into a horror movie.Folks, we have just been through this. Maybe this can help us wake up from the nightmare, or maybe not -- maybe it will just help us describe the nightmare more effectively. We laugh, we cry, if we survive it the credits roll. Using expert story-telling and ferocious images, Pinkins has made our nightmare materialize on the screen in red-hot terror, no let-up. The cast displays an energy that drags the viewer through some periods of jaw clenching that actually tired me out but thinking back on the last few years, I came to think of this as a catharsis. Two thumbs up and trembling."

This quickly goes down hill, as in an avalanche of bad circumstances placing his and Annie's life at risk.The film becomes inane rather quickly.

I liked that Jason Sudeikis can do more than straight comedy. I acknowledge there wasn't much on screen chemistry between Jason Sudeikis and Evangeline Lilly, however, the film was entertaining. There was comedic chemistry between Sudeikis and the boy, Thaddeus J. Mixson. I got a couple of chuckles watching the two.I didn't expect how dark the film would get after the boy was hospitalized. Sudeikis going full Rambo was unexpected. Joey the Italian Goomba with the herringbone gold chain over his shirt was a bit much . Also adding this film to the horror genre is a misclassification. I am guessing they assigned it a horror classification because of the motorcycle rider that was torn into two pieces. It was gory though but "horror" isn't appropriate for this film.I think a 6.5 out of 10 is fair."

And whatever happened to the missing 500k? It never gets explained. The mob boss has a conversation with Annie and apparently all is forgiven. Also what was up with that strange shot in the end. Who the hell was sitting on the boat in the middle of a lake? Was that supposed to be Jimmy hunched over dead? I didn't get it. When all said and done despite the second half it was a decent movie.

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11284502/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," ",""South of Heaven" opens with Jimmy (Jason Sudeikis) at a parole hearing, imploring for a chance to make up for twelve years of lost time with his betrothed Annie (Evangeline Lilly). She's dying of cancer - reckon she has about a year left. The walls are closing in. He starts giving the "I Had A Speech Prepared, But" monologue, and I confess that two minutes into the film, I am resisting the urge to furrow my brow. I try to keep my heart open, but there was apprehension at what I felt was... stock sentimentality. Call me a cynic.My reticence soon eased, and later faded into the ether. What I came to appreciate over "South of Heaven"'s two hours of violence and mischance was its thumping heart. It's there in the acting, earnestly imparted by Sudeikis, Lilly, and Mike Colter in a wonderfully layered role I won't go into. It's there in the writing, which reads a tad clunkily, but seems more genuine for it. It's also heard in the soundtrack. Scenes march to the rapping of a beating clock, whose tick-ticking reminds us, as it must remind our hero, that each passing moment is a moment bled from a rapidly dwindling reservoir.The film premiered at Beyond Fest 2021 at the Los Feliz 3 on Vermont (festively dubbed the Shudder Theatre), after which the director Aharon Keshales stuck around for a Q&A panel. Listening to him discuss his story's inspirations, I felt the same love for the characters that I feel in a Coen Brothers movie. Indeed, the film I kept returning to during "South of Heaven" was the Coens' first feature, the quiet masterpiece "Blood Simple" (someone's hand even gets a nail driven through it here). Like in that film, the characters are mere objects of fate, subject to a logical procession of events beyond anyone's control, but which informs their actions and thoughts in ways that are perfectly sensible for who they are.This said, I don't feel that Shea Whigham's Schmidt, a one-dimensional parole officer whose relevance is limited to indirectly setting the driving conflict in motion, really belongs. He's too cartoonish a villain for a film otherwise teeming with humor and humanity. I have no doubt that such people exist, and would naturally be drawn to positions affording such power over others, but his presence is an anomaly beside characters who are worse but afforded moments of empathy, even sorrow."South of Heaven" isn't perfect. But it's sincerely felt, in its compassion, in its sadness, in moments of levity found within grim situations, in embraces against a hanging sun, and in its final shot, which had my heart singing as it was overcome with longing.In other words, it had opened.EDIT: My girlfriend, who is smarter than I am, has helpfully suggested that Schmidt's character is meant to serve as a foil for someone. Seeing this interpretation through, I find that a specific scene has suddenly clicked for me, and I can better understand his inclusion.I am bumping my original rating of 3 stars out of 4 up a half-star."

What happened tot he 500k that was supposed to be the cause of all the conflict? Obviously, our hero and his friend didn't take it, but the writers didn't deem it necessary to explain how the money disappeared. Then when Price's men came looking for Jimmy in Mexico and he had to run for miles to get back to his wife, I think it's very unlikely that anyone would walk such a far distance to get supplies, especially when he has a truck. I really loved Evangeline Lily here and the story was quite engaging, that is until the end when Jimmy, who according to his wife was not a criminal, picked up a gun and went into the bad guys lair to bump them off like some PG rated John Wick.And what is that last shot supposed to be all about?"

Us older folks remember classic stories, like South of Heaven, that portray real people faced with extraordinary challenges. Old westerns come to mind, where the hero is thrown into a predicament that can't easily be fixed.This film is a modern day tragedy with realistic characters. Several times the hero did act on instinct. Consistently did the villain remain treacherous-while revealing his softer side, as did the heart of Annie remain true.Believable supporting cast, music that compliments the action and a script that hit all the beats.The direction of this film, the script, acting, score and cinematography all combined to deliver an emotional drama that entertains.Are there flaws in this movie? A couple small question marks but even those are forgiven without taking away from the overall story.I really wish filmmakers would make more pictures like this. My wife and I are only 59 but we were engrossed watching this because it's not b.s. Gangsters sometimes have heart and good guys sometimes become a badass to get the job done.The kid trying to live up to his dad's reality was another nice touch.Lotta good stuff goin' in this movie.**to the loser bashing this film.."step off punk."

","Aside from the trite and overused plot theme of a corrupt parole officer forcing an parolee into illegal activity, this movie didn't provide an answer for the reason everybody was killed. First, all Jimmy would've had to do is contact the FBI instead of acquiescing to his PO's demands...end of problem and he would've been a hero. Second, the ending was most unsatisfying. Tommy (if he lived) would be growing up without a Dad, and Annie would be spending her final days alone with no one to care for her since Jimmy had to go off on his quest. But the biggest flaw is that the plot never answered the question of what happened to the half-million dollars. Hello!!! - this was the reason all these people were killed! Watch at your own peril, but you'll be pretty dissatisfied when it's over."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11284502/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Good crime movie. ","Major Spoilers below: Don't read unless you've seen the movie.Not a blow em' up action flick, but a nice, slow paced crime movie with pretty good acting and directing. Similar stories have been told before in past movies, but let's be honest and admit that nothing is truly original anymore so for what it is I give it a thumbs up.I liked the mutual respect between the main good guy and the main bad guy. Not sure why the good guy didn't tell the bad guy about the son getting hit by a car; guess it had to happen that way in order for the final hit to get ordered which lead to the big shootout at the end.My only question/confusion is HOW it ended. At first you see him reunite with his love, then it cuts to a scene with him apparently dead on the boat from his gun shot wounds whilst en route to his love. Was the reuniting scene a dream he had, or she had? I don't know. My opinion is they should have just picked one ending instead of including the "alternate" ending in the final scene. It made things confusing. Maybe it's one of those pick your own ending films which is not brave in my opinion. But hey, I watch movies, not make them. Other than that I would definitely recommend this for a movie night. 8 out of 10."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11285280/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," I like this Lamp, too ","This took a little while to get fully formed for me into a satisfying experience, largely because for about the first half hour or so (or sorry just before we get to 'second trimester') Ed Helms as Matt is doing an awkward character shtick where he says lots of things ala like an Office character (not his or even Michael Scott's, but in that ballpark), blurring out inappropriate or Oh No Dude bits to this lovely young woman carrying his child, via a charming and amusing and yet sad performance from Patti Harrison as Anna. It's like Beckwith is finding her footing with writing for this man who isn't fully sure about who he is around people - as if to hit the nail so far on the head that it comes out the other side we find out his dough comes from an app called "Loner" - and the acting is all real while the dialog is trying to be funny and Helms is too and it just isn't there.And then these two souls, lo and behold, sit down and have a conversation and it isn't so much that it goes into high drama as we just get interesting character development not only through what is said but what isn't, and how Helms and Harrison find little beats in between their lines that can get us completely invested in them from then on. What's revealed doesn't mean we should expect that they'll wind up together, though I might lean that way if it wasn't made more on the independent route (I know the first note from a studio would be about the Woody Allen font for the credits, what must itself be a self conscious irony given a dialog exchange about his films at one point and how this will inevitably be compared by some short sighted film critoc, but I digress), but it does mean that we can understand then deeply as people who are not lonely but comfortable, or at least that's what they can tell themselves in the moment, with being alone, which is a different thing.For the rest of the movie then on, I got more absorbed into the emotional wavelength Beckwith was presenting as far as Matt and together and how they just become friends and is about forming an intimacy that naturally unfolds because of the actors finding nuances and little details to play in every scene (and as Harrison plays up the mounting hormones, which aren't just that) and the care in building them up as people in the script. It helps that there aren't any giant contrivance points along the way or like this or that misunderstanding that blows up all over, instead these are filled with Life's Little Moments, and how a connection is formed through Matt's sincerity and Anna's vulnerability.One should point out some exceptions to breaking up this flow - I can once again hear Patton Oswalt from his bit shouting GAY BEST FRIEEEEND on movies (Rom Coms notoriously) with that trope and good lord this one has a doozy, and it wouldn't even be a problem if he were funny, but the actor doesn't transcend the weak writing for the character - and that Matt's mom (Nora Dunn!) and some of the friends at that one party scene are overbearing to an extent you only get in little Dramedies like these to momentarily up some stakes (think like, say, much more low stakes Shiva Baby in that one scene, or maybe that's just me).On the other hand, there is this sense underlying much of the film that perhaps Beckwith is also playfully but unmistakably satirizing people who take their lives and how they go about the process of getting to delivery unmistakably in San Francisco, and that helps to ground Matt and Anna as basically good people trying to navigate a world that takes itself at times very seriously. Maybe, ultimately, we all just need someone we can watch a 90s sitcom with and can help pick out a color for a wall without so much pretention. And again, it comes down to believing these two people, separate and together, and I do. It's not great and only ok as a comedy, but as a low-key but powerful drama it's terrific."

There isn't any romance between the two leads and very little comedy-there is some, but very little-and it wasn't just me, my wife did not like it, either. Ed plays a 45ish year old man that lives alone but decides that he wants a baby. Patti plays his 26ish year old surrogate. Rosalind plays the doctor and Tig is a person that Ed & Patti talk to about their strange relationship-psychiatrist, maybe? They never really say. Anyway, Ed & Patti become friends-even watching the tv show 'Friends' together-but never anything romantic. The whole movie is about them going through the pregnancy together. Before the movie starts, the director has a pre_recorded introduction where she tells the audience that she is glad people are back in the theaters-after seeing this movie, they may not come back anymore-and also tells you that after the end credits, there will be a Q & A with her and the 2 lead actors. They talk about how much fun it was doing the movie and how much they loved the script.It's rated "R" for language and sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 30 minutes.It's not one that I would buy on DVD.

Ed Helms (as Matt) and Patti Harrison (as Anna) play the mid-40s and mid-20s loners respectively, their connection slowly evolving into something platonic. While the core plot revolves around the pregnancy aspect, the little details we get to know about the duo and their unlikely chemistry make the film engaging. Their relationship is never explored from a sexual angle, which most clichd rom-coms would (I wouldn't classify this as one!) - Together Together remains a dramedy. Both the leads are wonderful, with the supporting cast ably pitching in. There's a sense of predictable aimlessness in the plot, especially in the final 20 minutes and an ending that feels a bit abrupt. It's still worth a viewing for its funny exchanges, however."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11285280/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Sundance 2021: Together Together holds a humorously clever screenplay and two wonderful performances! ","If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)I really like being surprised by actors who usually do comedy taking a serious, dramatic role or simply showing something different from the type of performances we're used to seeing. I love Ed Helms - who doesn't? - but the whole "having a baby" storyline has been tackled so many times that I was a bit scared this would turn out to be a disappointment. Fortunately, Together Together is not only a really creative title that viewers will understand midway through the film but a lovely, fun, charming platonic love story that's also educative about surrogacy.First of all, Ed Helms proves that he can indeed do anything he puts his mind to. Matt is a genuinely compelling character, as is Anna, and both share exceptional development through Nikole Beckwith's witty screenplay. Packed with an enjoyable lightness and smart humor, Helms and Patti Harrison offer two wonderful displays, but I must praise Beckwith's script again. Every dialogue feels so authentic, honest, and real. I'm not the biggest fan of rom-coms or the formula "two strangers fall in love in the most unexpected way", but Together Together just makes me feel so good about myself.That's the biggest compliment I can offer this movie: it makes me happy. Despite it still being generic and unsurprising, I was never bored, I didn't roll my eyes I single time, and I laughed out loud quite often. It's one of those films people can go to the theater and leave in a better state of mind than what they entered with. In addition to this, I watched the emotionally overwhelming Mass after lunch, so I needed these consecutive viewings of Marvelous and the Black Hole and Together Together to brighten my day. So, thank you to everyone involved in the latter.Together Together possesses such a humorously clever screenplay that its joyful, fun aura passes to its own title, which carries more meaning than what it looks like. Ed Helms and Patti Harrison boast sincere chemistry, delivering two charming portrayals of characters who are emotionally worthy of investing in. Nevertheless, Nicole Beckwith deserves all the compliments for her lovely take on such a formulaic topic while educating viewers on surrogacy at the same time. From the genuine, realistic dialogues to the surprisingly efficient humor (I wasn't expecting to laugh as much as I did), I couldn't be happier. I know the ending is purposefully abrupt, but I'm not sure it fully works for me.Rating: B+"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11285280/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Quirky chemistry and delicious awkward moments ","IN A NUTSHELL: Written and directed by Nikole Beckwith, this dramedy is about a loner who becomes the gestational surrogate for a single man in his 40s. As strangers, they come to realize their unexpected relationship will challenge their perceptions of connection, boundaries, and love. The popular film first showed at the Sundance Film Festival and garnered instant praise.THINGS I LIKED: Everyone fell in love with Ed Helms when we first saw him on The Office: The Complete Series. He plays his typical hapless man-child character, which many people find endearing. If you don't like him, don't watch this movie. There's a very sweet monologue by Ed Helms about why he wants to have a baby as a single man. His character developed an app called "Loner." Both of the characters are loners who learn how to navigate an unexpected friendship. One of my sons also invented a dating app! It's called Mutual and is doing great! Ed Helms and Patti Harrison have good, awkward chemistry together.I've never seen Patti Harrison perform in anything before. She's really fantastic and I can't wait to see what else she can do.Julio Torres is hilarious and has some of the funniest lines in the movie.Comedian Tig Notaro has been popping up in a lot of movies lately. I'm always surprised when Tig's characters are serious!I've seen how parents will mark a wall to illustrate how tall their child has grown, but I hadn't seen the idea before of having a pregnant woman lie flat on the floor and marking how high her belly gets during the 9 months! Cute idea!I appreciated the fact that the movie illustrates how long and painful childbirth can be. I delivered 4 babies and can tell you it wasn't easy! Totally worth it though, of course! The expressions on Ed Helms' face and Patti Harrison's face were priceless at the moment the baby was born. The feels!Lovely music.Did you notice that the opening font of the movie is the same as what you see in Woody Allen films?I love seeing Nora Dunn but thought her character was super annoying and insensitive. I just cringed whenever she walked into the room. There's a strong message from the director there. Message received.If you're a fan of the popular TV show Friends, you'll get a kick out of some of their conversations about that show.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE: So many painful, awkward, uncomfortable moments! The comedic tone is very flat. It's intentional but not a style people are used to.We don't get a lot of backstory on the leading man.I thought there would be more lines using the expression "Together Together" to describe what their relationship was or wasn't.There are some jabs at Costco. C'mon! I love Costco!The movie ends so abruptly. I wanted it to keep going to experience the big payoff.Patti Harrison's makeup was a bit distracting when you could see the line of foundation on her neck.Some of the decisions that Matt has to make, like choosing paint color in the baby's bedroom, illustrate how completely ill-equipped he is to have a baby. There's not much discussion about whether or not he should be having a baby, just that he is.It was kind of creepy that Ed Helm's character wanted to pretend to breastfeed with that special nursing vest. Still, it showed he was all in!TIPS FOR PARENTS: Lots of talk of sex A male character demonstrates how to use a tampon with visual aids Kids will be very bored.You can see my full review on my Movie Review Mom YouTube channel!"

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11285280/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Some Very Good Among the Bad ","Even a hard heart like myself appreciates the special moments of a father and mother in the delivery room as the baby arrives. In this film is one of the best, or the best, such scene.SPOILER: The non-resolution of Matt and Anna's future grips hard as an ending, even if you previously invested very little in the film other than "where is this going?" To that degree, it was essential this be a feature film rather than a short, just to build up to that.Ed Helms as the standard white guy reaches an "awkward putz" pinnacle early, but the early insertion of that characterization softens as we find Matt to have some stones, even if there is no "I saved your life so you must love me forever" moment. He doesn't dribble through a series of demeaning scenes, as is standard these days, but rather rises to occasions, even if he must ignore the snarky world-at-large to do it. His odd occupation gives him room to breathe as the always-there father-to-be, and accounts for his bucks to make his dream happen. His story is a decent reflection of our times: guy can't find love because the world is so fractured, even if he tries to sympathize with that changed world. Because of that, we can believe his unattached state, but this doesn't quite account for his obsession to have child. Casting Ed Helms was probably as good as this was going to get, as his exaggerated facial expressions filled in somewhat weak writing in spots.As for Anna, she also seemed hopeless at first, but was given room to breathe. The big flaw with Anna is that she is so strong in her weakness. She is too heroic, in a ditzy lucky way, and her sob story doesn't quite convince. On the good side, Patti Harrison is a perfect casting, as she convinces quite well that she is a lost soul who has suddenly found the answer.A small complaint: a more valid reason for concern with Anna and her hookup would have been an STD, not an invasion of her privates. Granted, it sets up a small jealousy, as well as father-figure, emotional moment on which to build some interest in Anna. However, I'm talking reality not fiction.The rest of the cast seemed additional, just puppets for Matt and Anna's play. An enormous helping of snark and surprised looks wears thin quickly. Of course, we could say this exists as the protagonists' storm to weather. That they are out of the ordinary element where even lesbian couples in a New Age-y Lamaze (or whatever it is) class is considered routine. So much so that the writer felt obligated to mention "Reaganomics" as the primer for the "straight white dude" she was likely to birth. In a soft way, that was heroic.I imagined I would fast-forward through this, but at about 20 minutes in I let go of the remote and watched it fully. I give this film a 7 as pretty watchable, but also you have to let certain things just be if you want to get to the next scene. Typical modern-day stuff, but the casting and ending make this worthwhile."

The film is filled with many delightful scenes and moments. It has enough scenes that go nowhere or are presented too unconventionally to really work well that the film does not consistently engage. This thoughtful film is never dull, but it does have brief moments of disinterest. At least on the big screen, the make up on the actors is distractingly obvious."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11285280/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Worth a watch ","I was able to see this at Sundance Festival 2021's virtual screening."Together Together" is about how Matt, a single, middle-aged tech worker in Northern California hires Anna, who is in her twenties, as a surrogate mother to his child. As their relationship progresses and Anna gets closer to delivering their baby, they grow more emotionally dependent on each other. The film examines the boundaries between their relationship, not only as a surrogate mother to the baby's father, but also as they become friends.This is the kind of movie people often refer to as "cute." It's certainly not a groundbreaking effort that will change your life, but it will provoke some laughs and maybe even cause you to get teary-eyed in a couple of scenes. I thought the film's opening scene with both characters nervously interviewing each other was very funny. Anna's continues to revise her answers to Matt's questions as he scribbles them into a notebook, and he does his best to accommodate her by crossing out many of her responses as she asks him to.I found Ms. Harrison to be very believable in her role. Her performance turns the role of Anna into someone very real and vulnerable; there's an innocence about her, but also a loneliness, something we learn she and Matt have in common as the film progresses. Ed Helms is also effective in his role, but he plays the role very much like, well, Ed Helms. Except for a scene at the end of the film, the part doesn't really require him to step very far out of his comfort zone. Julio Torres is also very funny as Anna's zoned-out co-worker, as well as Tig Notaro's brief role as a therapist and Sufe Bradshaw as a hospital technician."Together Together" won't win any big awards, but I recommend it for what it is: a gentle comedy about the importance of non-romantic relationships, a theme that should be explored more often. The plot is often predictable, but, let's face it, isn't that typical of films like this?A sidenote: Curiously, this feature was presented as one of Sundance 2021's gay-themed films. The character of Matt is a single, middle-aged man living in San Francisco. During his two or three discussions with Anna when she asks him about his his past relationships, he seems to be deliberately explaining things in a vague way, intentionally leaving out genders. His character clearly struck me as a closeted gay man and I expected an eventual reveal as the film continued. It didn't happen. Instead, the director stated during the Q&A that she had written the part of Matt to be heterosexual. I was left feeling confused why he was written to be so deliberately coy and avoidant when mentioning genders in his past relationships if he was straight. I'm assuming this was categorized as a "gay themed film" due to Ms. Harrison's participation, but she's playing a straight, cisgender woman in her role."

Maybe he could have been a boxer once, but now, who knows what will happen?"

If you had anything to do with their world, you were never free.This is a little slow -- it seems longer than it is. Yet, it's good. I have one comment. It needed much more Kirk Fox. He steals the movie even though he is used sparingly. I'm going to look for him in other things."

I felt like i was watching it in a theater instead of at home and it wasn't like other independent films where the sound is spotty. The Maine actors did really well portraying characters that felt real and alive. I was invested in the relationships, as heartbreaking as they were. I highly recommend."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11296142/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","2"," Disappointing, cliched and forgettable ","I stayed to the end of this movie, but wished several times to get up and leave. I should have listened to that inner voice. By the end I felt resentful of the 90 minutes I had spent in the film and could have been doing anything else like walking my dog. None of the characters were very well developed in terms of writing or acting. The two romantic leads had very little chemistry between them. And the characters made decisions that were definitely not in their own best interest or in the interest of anyone that they cared about. The whole thing was just a frustrating experience to watch. I gave it two stars only because the sequences on the boat were interesting and well done. I would have liked to have stayed on the ship longer and not venture into the town or any of the other nonsense. It felt unnecessarily violent in many parts and as we left I could hear other people wondering as I was why the main character made the decision he did at the end which seemed to serve no one but the bad guys. I guess I should feel lucky that it was the only one of the many films I saw at the Phoenix film festival this year that was really disappointing. Most were fabulous and I look forward to seeing them get broader releases."

Loved the story line with great acting to develop characters you love and hate all at the same time. As dark and heavy as it can get, there's some witty banter along the way that makes this a fun ride. Definitely recommend!"
