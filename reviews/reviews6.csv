She learns that her brother was the man that was always there for everyone. But soon, she starts to learn that his death may not be what it seems to be.So many movies we review seem to be about the inabiity to go home again. Perhaps filmmakers are working out their tough childhoods through their art. This is another example of that, but it's a story well shot and director and writer Spencer King seems to be just getting started. Here's to seeing what he does next."

Performance highlights include the stellar Eleanor Lambert, whose first time showing off her chops leave a profound impression and set the stage for a magnificent career to come, as well as Claudia Black who sheds her sci-fi/action roots to bring a much needed warmth and light to the darkness weighing over our lead.

The lives of these three women, though particular and intimate, effectively represents a larger story of a culture interrupted by colonialism but regaining its strength and groundedness. The interaction between the personal and the cultural, memory and the moment, are woven together with various events, spanning decades, creating a complex portrait revealing how the past, the present and the future interact with each other, how members of a family interact through space and time, in life and in death. Though the performances were sometimes uneven, the editing and Terence Malick-like cinematography very skillfully conveyed a specific yet expansive spiritual and cultural journey through the entire lives of three compelling and tangible characters."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10483044/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," The Cost and Continuing Effects of Colonialism ","This is a hard film to watch at times, but I felt in showing stories that happened and are still happening to Indigenous people and communities, it was to help deniers and minimizers to wake-up to the truth, and encourage those working for positive change and better intercultural respect and cooperation to continue despite the racism and sexism persisting in society due to historical amnesia, Eurocentric education, and apathy.Apologies and acknowledgement of colonial and contemporary crimes against Indigenous people are not enough without honesty and true structural, educational and inter-community changes. For Indigenous peoples like the Maori, the effects of genocide and ethnocide that began in colonial times continues today. The effects are within both the individuals and their communities: trauma of all kinds, loss of identity, cultures, land, Self. Yet another horrible fact is the cycle of abuse and trauma against them exacerbated crimes within Indigenous communities, against each other, with children especially affected.Mostly especially, from the past to present, the treatment of Indigenous girls and women was/is especially horrific, yet minimized and often silenced. This film both subtly and directly shows the psychological, spiritual and physical torment inflicted by peoples of European descent in their Eurocentric efforts to purify "Others", particularly through "Christianity", the beliefs and edicts of which were rewritten to serve the desires of European men to retain unchallenged power and invent supposed superiority. And remember, they first betrayed, tortured and killed their own non-Christian peers, particularly women, before invading and inflicting terror worldwide. It's all an ugly cycle that needs ending, so healing can begin for all."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10483044/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," Nothing can break the bond of a loving family! ","There's something about New Zealand-made films that really resonate with me. Much like French movies they have something a little different about them that helps them stand out from other cinema features. I'm not sure if it's the quirky humour, the beautiful scenery, or just the wonderful ability to tell a good story, but films like Once Were Warriors, Black Sheep, Hunt for the Wilderpeople and now Cousins, show that New Zealand is definitely on the forefront of great, original movie making.Based on the bestselling novel by Patricia Grace, Cousins tells the story of three girl cousins and the three very different paths their lives take. Makareta has been brought up in a well-off family and is being set up for an arranged marriage unbeknownst to her. Missy is the tomboy of the group and has to make tough decisions that are best for her and the family, while Mata has had the toughest upbringing. Being handed off to an orphanage by her father, she struggles to find her way in the world and is being brought up by an uncaring, unloving guardian who refuses to teach her the ways of the world. This abuse, of course, stunts Mata's growth as a person, and her being unable to function properly in society eventually leaves Mata out on the street and barely able to get by. But the bond of these three cousins is so strong that Makareta sets out to look for Mata while Missy protects the land on which they grew up. In a story filled with so much heartbreak, hardship and tears we're left to discover whether these cousins will ever be able to truly find one another again.THE GOODCousins is a film where everybody - from the actors to the directors to the composer to the cinematographer - were all on point. I'll have to admit that I was hooked when the music to the trailer for this film hit me and gave me shivers. It's a heartbreaking tale but one told with a gentleness and a very light touch of humour that you can't help but be drawn into this fascinating tale. Marta is the centrepiece of the film and her abusive upbringing is the catalyst that the story is based around. The main characters are each given three different timelines exploring their stories (child, teenager & adult) and although they're all exceptional in their roles, it's the three children who really stand out. Bringing a wide-eyed innocence to the film, it's amazing how natural they play off each other on camera. On the other hand, the adult actors bring a lot of heart to the script and leave you begging for a happy ending even though it seems near impossible.THE BADThe whole aspect of child custody and land rights is prominent in this film and I was left to wonder: A) if it was true and B) what was left to come for this family as the end credits rolled. Don't get me wrong it was a movie that was well told but it seemed that a lot of the big questions were left unanswered. It's by no means a film that needs a sequel but one in which doesn't give a lot of answers or resolution to some of the story threads.THE UGLYThe plight of the Maori people seems eerily similar to those of the Indigenous people of Australia. Being treated differently because of the colour of their skin, being made to feel lesser, and being ostracised from the community as a whole seems a characteristic which unfortunately transcends borders all around the globe. Raw and real, it may be tough to watch at times but it's definitely worth seeing and hopefully learning from.Cousins is by no means an uplifting story but has uplifting elements to it. A movie in which everyone, in front and behind the camera, seemed to be on the same page will teach you things about the Maori culture that you may have never known and is a film that puts family above all else. In this day and age that seems like a very important lesson to learn.FOUR AND A HALF SILVER FERNS OUT OF FIVE."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10483386/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," Mumbai Saga is a Disaster Saga. Nothing short of a B Grade Mass Mania. ","Mumbai Saga (2021) : Movie Review -Mumbai Saga was in making when Bollywood was doing good with Action flicks, especially right after John Abraham had success like Satyameva Jayate. Sanjay Gupta known for making typical entertainers in this genre came up with an idea of journey of Bombay becoming Mumbai and how gangwars and cops had several remarkable events in the time that should be told to current generation. Mumbai Saga finds a good cast and nice set up to showcase it but Director's outdated vision and literally B Grade presentation takes everything away from the film.The plot of the movie is set in the era of the 80s and 90s which were marked as a transformed period of Mumbai. It was supposed to present Bombay's transformation hit by national events but eventually it forgets to show any of them. A simple hardworking young man Amartya Rao (John Abraham) goes to become a gangster who now wants to rule the city with the help political giant Bhau (Mahesh Majarekar). As expected he kills some big names and then a brave but money-seeker Police Officer Vijay (Emraan Hashmi) finds interest in ending Amatya's reign. Mumbai Saga had a chance to take references from big issue like 'Mills Shut down' but unfortunately it fails and doesn't even understand the Idea of it.Mumbai Saga is not an acting oriented film so all they had to do is keep the swag alive while delivering the massy dialogues. John Abraham as Amartya is physically terrific and delivers the dialogues with smashing attitude. The same is followed by Emraan Hashmi who doesn't match the physical attitude of John but still packs a solid punch with conversational dhaasu dialogues. However, the acting is not that good to be noticed and wasn't even expected at first place. The supporting cast is okay and well supported by Kajal Aggarwal, Rohit Roy, Mahesh Manjarekar, Gulshan Grover, Amol Gupte, Prateik Babbar and cameo of Suniel Shetty.Talking about the technical aspects, Mumbai Saga isn't pleasing anywhere except for the loud background score. The dialogues are damn hard-hitting and whistle worthy but only if it had correct situations and right commands of skillful execution. The cinematography is decent, the action sequences are fine and the Music is somehow suitable to its massy theme. Mumbai Saga falters in the screenwriting because of utter non sense theories and typical 80s thinking from the writer. Almost 95% of dialogues and 90% of the scenes are predictable, one can even predict the dialogues and scenes just before it happens on screen.Sanjay Gupta isn't a name known for high quality material in Bollywood but he has made some watchable crime action dramas before so there was a level of expectations set for him that he can deliver a one time watchable flick anytime. With Mumbai Saga that bar is down by one level which certainly hurts his position. From the trailer itself the film gives you the idea of what's going on and how's it put on screen so of course you shouldn't be expecting anything top class. But whatever your expectations are, Mumbai Saga still doesn't fullfill them or rather it lowers them. Overall, it's a stuff that should be skipped but if you are one of those who is die hard fan of Mass Mania and doesn't care how it comes then Mumbai Saga could be one time flick for you.RATING - 4/10*"

A. movie. I have seen plenty of his films. Some have been very good and some where he makes an absolute clown of himself.In the first place, the man cannot "ACT". He came into mainstream Bollywood through modelling. He built himself a huge muscular physique because he has no acting talent whatsoever. Most Bollywood actors take this path: Hrithik Roshan, Aamir Khan, Tiger Shroff being some of many obvious examples.This film is a typical junk underworld vs police. You don't require intelligence to watch this movie - at some points the film is quite ridiculous. No doubt as a popcorn and soda movie it is quite entertaining. Photography and background sound effects are the main strong-points of this film. Watch out for Amole Gupte who is by far the best actor of the lot. Sunil Shetty has just a small cameo-type role.Final verdict: just about a good time pass film and one that should be flushed afterwards."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10483386/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Mass Entertainer ","Review By Kamal KA common family man turns into ruthless gangster after been tortured by a gang of rowdies... & there is a police inspector who want to encounter that ruthless gangster under the order of politician. In short the story is very familiar to us since from last 10 yrs. Now directly came to the positive & negative aspects of this film.PositiveEnsemble cast.John Abraham's personality as a ruthless gangster & his actions. Specially in the scene where John Abraham firing with loaded AK-47 is clap worthy scene.Mahesh Manjrekar's dark acting.BGM.. Actually all gangster movie requires a strong & goosebump BGM. & we can feel that goosebumps partially in this film!Sets... Yeah ! That's the vital thing for all kinds of gangster films specially if those films are based on Mumbai.. Sanjay Gupta has a well made sets for his Mumbai Saga.. & to make the film too real to look & feel there is several dron shoots which is really left it's impact.Good songs specially Danka Baja.Last but not the least Emraan Hashmi's grand entry... The man who make his entry worthy. No doubt that he himself take the responsibility to his shoulders & make the 2nd half far better than 1st half...NegativeToo much using of Yellow colour in background.. I agree, to feel Mumbai of 80's & 90's Yellow colour plays a vital role. But too much of everything spoils the food. In some place its normal & in some scenes it looks over using.The first half is not so engaging & interesting. Rather it looks over the top. I mean to say that director Sanjay Gupta based his storyline for Mumbai Saga is inspired from 80's & 90's gang war. But how a single man (John) can fight with 20 people in jail!! By trying to make the film mass entertainment Sanjay Gupta forgot that his main plot is based on real gang war & not the film like Satyameva Jayate where a single man fights with 20 people all alone...Dialogues are good but surely not the CITI MAAR dialogues like Shootout At Wadala.Worth to watch specially for 2nd half. No harm to watch with family."

Same old Mumbai Gangster movie that we have watched a million times before. The script is not coherent and the edits are scrappy. The acting from John is a bit over the top. Prateik Babbar is ok and has performed decently but the hairstyle and look chosen for him makes him look funny. . Rohit Roy does a brilliant job with his expressions but the hairstyle, make up and costumes make him look like a buffoon. Gone is the era for such gangster movies."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10483386/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," Ok ","This movie is ok same gangster movie need more different."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10483386/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," The intent fails to translate the film into an intense and gripping drama ","Mumbai Saga is directed by Sanjay Gupta who hitherto has specialised in gangster and dark underworld stories. On this occasion, his subject is Amartya Rao (played by John Abraham). He is an ordinary guy who, with his brother Arjun runs a vegetable stall. He undergoes a transformation into a toughie after Arjun is antagonised by Gaitonde's (Amol Gupte) goons for "hafta" collection. Amartya is soon identified by Bhau (Mahesh Manjrekar), an aspiring politician and sel proclaimed alternative in governance, to become the gangster of Dadar who can challenge Gaitonde.Life changes for Amartya as he scents success and he extends his empire. On the other hand, law takes cognizance of his activities and unleashes Inspector Vijay Sawarkar (Emraan Hashmi) to eliminate Amartya. Vijay is an upright ATS policeman with a brilliant record of encounter deaths. Amartya becomes aware of Vijay's intentions when the former eliminates Sunil Khaitan, a businessman who had plans to transform Mumbai and had joined hands with Gaitonde to kill Amartya. He is advised to go underground for a while by Bhau, but is forced to return to Mumbai when his brother Arjun is critically wounded. The end of Mumbai Saga is predictable and obvious as the final showdown with Amartya's nemesis Vijay Sawarkar looms large in the horizon.Mumbai Saga is based on true events John Abraham plays Amar Naik, Emraan Hashmi as Vijay Salaskar, Pratiek Babbar as Ashwin Naik, Amol Gupte as Arun Gawli and Mahesh Manjrekar as Balasaheb Thackrey. Mumbai Saga is quite similar to Sanjay Gupta's prior Shootout at Lokhandwala (2007) or Shootout at Wadala (2013). Comparison with these films turns Mumbai Saga into an insipid, slow and unexciting storytelling. You could perhaps accuse me of breeding contempt due to familiarity, but factually, Mumbai Saga drags and resorts to violent, gory episodes whilst meandering through the customary twists and turns you would expect from a Sanjay Gupta film. John Abraham fights, hyperventilates and gnarls, but doesn't impress. If you don't have time, then Mumbai Saga is worth skipping."

In this movie also, John becomes a dreaded gangster because someone tried to kill his brother.Till Interval, you will only see John Abraham and Rohit Roy. The only good reason to watch this movie is Emraan Hashmi as 'Inspector Vijay Savarkar'. Talking about the performances, John and Emraan are phenomenal is there respective roles.

One particular flaw was Bhau's grandson not growing up over the years while everyone else was growing up. Action scenes were poor and unrealistic. John Abraham acted the same way he does in every movie. Emraan Hashmi was the highlight of the movie even though he appears only in the second half. Good to see him in an action packed role for once.

Mumbai Saga has nothing new to offer, it's just another average masala entertainer.The first half holds our attention as fierce John Abraham delivers a good performance as a dreaded gangster. But he struggles in the emotional scenes. Post interval, Emraan Hashmi steals the show with his screen presence, action, and dialogue delivery.But the second half lacks a gripping narrative and the screenplay becomes obtuse. Also, there was much room for tighter editing. But if you are a fan of gangster dramas then it is definitely a one-time watch for you. The cinematography is good. The music and background score are just fine.Kajal Aggarwal manages to shine in her limited role but Anjana Sukhani hardly got 1 or 2 scenes. Other impressive performances came from Mahesh Manjrekar and Amole Gupte.

This BHAU and BHAI story, you have seen in so many Bollywood movies. A vegetable seller growing into don of underworld in 10 minutes screen time and the speed is forte of Sanjay Gupta . Both the lead Amartya and Sanvarkar played by John Abraham and Imran Haashmi are brilliant. I remember the days when John Abraham hardly used to deliver dialogues and used to get role because of his macho image but now he is able to carry the whole movie on his shoulders. Mahesh Manjrekar has a stereo- typed role written with keeping him in mind . Two ladies Kajal Aggarwal and Anjana Sukhani have hardly anything to do in this male dominated testosterone.

No spoilers here, but lets just say my kids figured out where the treasure is in the first 10 minutes of the film, so you can see it's not a very deep adventure movie. Characters development is ok, the parents are portrayed as caricatures as always, but unfortunately, regardless of that, there are places when the dialogues are very cringey, so much so, that a good director should have asked for a writing change and a retake.The movie is not romantically moving and doesn't make you laugh, cry or fright at any point which for me is the biggest opportunity miss, it is just too flat and doesn't take any risks. This is the main reason why it is not at the level of the old 80's movies (Goonies, Stand by me, Short circuit...). When I rate this movie I do not refer to it as a "summer fix" but rather, I look at is as any other production value, writing and acting, this is just not a 8/10 kind of creation, it is more like a 6, but if your entire family want to watch something that is safe for any age this could be on your list.Exact score: 58 / 100."

Bob has been around for a long time and lives by eating people, or comedians, supplied to him by his assistant. When Violet falls for Jimmy Rhodes (Will Weldon) she works to keep him off the menu.This is a quirky comedy without any real horror.

The climax generally is done well, where we also get dialogue that contains minor thematic content. But by that point I was hardly in the state of mind to care - it was (pardon me) too little, too late.Passing moments are sufficiently amusing to provide levity. Call me a cynic, though - I don't think a Venn diagram comparing "levity" and "comedy" is a circle. Which leads me to necessarily ask: Was 'Too late' supposed to be funny?Those elements that are done well are unremarkable, and meager, and far outweighed by so much more that makes no impression at all. This isn't bad. Just dull. So very, very dull. So dull that it may as well be a total clunker for the near total lack of entertainment.Watching 'Too late' is like suffering through an unfunny open mic night - I just feel bad for everyone on the stage.

This film aptly depicts ambition and celebrity as a humanity-killing lifestyle. Something all audiences are familiar with by now. Stories abound of people like Bob, entertainers whose onscreen personae bear zero resemblance to the off-screen overblown egotism that consumes many of these people. Ellen DeGeneres comes to mind, and this story's very likable comedian Bob, beloved by his fans, is a literal parasite offstage. He's a fun antagonist and probably captures the truer nature of Hollywood success. Fun story. A brave indie with a timeless message."

I watched it for the sole reason that Mary Lynn Rajskub got top billing.... She had perhaps four minutes in this movie, which is sad because she's such a powerhouse of awesomeness.... Everything she is in is better for her being in it. As it was though, this movie is OK. It was hard to care for the characters enough to really care when they were in any danger. On the bright side, I discovered Jenny Zigrino and will be watching more of her work. Fred Armisen was also in it a bit, and really, what isn't Fred Armisen great in?I think it could have been whittled down a bit and been a third of a horror/comedy anthology movie along the lines of Creepshow or Steven King's Cat's Eye where it could be the center piece book-ended by two better-made films. This isn't a fife or nine star movie like I see other people have rated it, but it's no worse than a solid four stars."

But Violet's getting tired of playing second fiddle and wants to strike out on her own. She's been feeding Bob's addiction too long.

Can she doing standup on her own? Success is just a burp away, if only she can shake off Bob.The real comedy of this movie isn't the standup.

","When I got the chance to sit down and watch "The Ghosts of Borley Rectory" I did so immediately. Why? Well, first of all, the movie has Julian Sands on the cast list, and also it being a horror movie that I hadn't already seen.However, I only knew about "The Ghosts of Borley Rectory" because I had seen it on Julian Sands IMDb list, but aside from that, then I had heard nothing about this movie. So I wasn't really sure what I was in for here, nor really knowing anything about it, aside from it being a horror movie.Well, "The Ghosts of Borley Rectory" wasn't really all that great of a movie. And even for a horror movie then its plot and storyline was fairly bland, if not actually downright generic. This was essentially just a run-of-the-mill haunted house movie, and not a particularly great one at that.There was nothing scary to be seen in "The Ghosts of Borley Rectory", unless you are a rookie and a newcomer to the horror genre. For a seasoned veteran such as myself then "The Ghosts of Borley Rectory", as written by Christopher Jolley and Steven M. Smith, was a mere stroll in the park.Visually then "The Ghosts of Borley Rectory" wasn't particularly thrilling or great. There were a few special effects here and there, but they weren't on any noteworthy level, and came off merely as being watchable. So don't sit down to watch this movie with the intentions of seeing something amazing or super scary.Director Steven M. Smith didn't really revolutionize the horror genre here with "The Ghosts of Borley Rectory", nor did he bring anything new or interesting to the haunted house subgenre.The acting performances in "The Ghosts of Borley Rectory" were bland. There wasn't any particular great performances here, and even Julian Sands seemed to run on auto-pilot, and he wasn't given all that much screen time anyway."The Ghosts of Borley Rectory" was not a horror movie that left me with any great impression, and it is one that will slowly fade into the mists of oblivion and I will never take another gander at it. Yeah, it was just that bland and mundane.My rating of "The Ghosts of Borley Rectory" lands on a generous three out of ten stars."

It's not as though there is a lack of talent and experience in some of the roles (and in others there is zero ), even so, the on screen performance seems to have been left to reading some lines of the script and repeating them as the scene is shot. Zero direction for the rare talented individuals at all.The few shots meant to be horrific were just shot as is with zero effort made in post to make them anywhere near scary at all!The story isn't any better.

This is by far the best Borley Rectory film I've seen. Music comes from the masterful Darren Wonnacott, turning of all things dark, damnable and disturbing providing a score that fits perfectly, providing chills in all the right places.Overall The Ghosts of Borley Rectory is a triumph, well written, acted, and filmed, and with such attention to detail that it draws the viewer deeper into its web.

"," And interestiing telling of a real story ","It isn't fair to judge this film as a genre ghost story, because it isn't. It's a retelling of real story from the 1920's and should be judged as such. As a based on a True Story tell it reasonably recreates the story as told in the papers of the time. There have been a number of films and TV plays retelling the story over the last few years and this is one of the better ones with good acting from Wilcox, Sands and Baker and some interesting photography and direction. So if you watching this in expectation of a 'The Conjuring' style story are going to be disappointed but if a story of another time when the people where recovering from the impacts of a mass casualty war with an attendant growth in belief in the supernatural then this will be of interest."

With that in mind, "The Ghosts of Borley Rectory", directed by Steven M Smith, creates a creepy atmosphere in an unstable environment, a bit reminiscent of Michael Jackson's "Thriller". The actors, including some notable names, the director (who co-wrote the script), the camera crew and make up artist all join together, ably supported by a great music score, to deliver an entertaining 80 minutes."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10505316/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Winks to our epoch ","Lost illusions is for many critics, the best Balzac's novel and the adaptation that Xavier Giannoli (the director) delivers is not only fairly pleasant, dynamic and very well interpreted, it also has a special resonance in our world controled by social networks, search for buzz, influencers, fake news and a few rich media owners.However, the story seems quite far from our world as it takes place in the first part of the 19th century (around 1840) during the period of "Restauration", when monarchy came back to power in France but also when the liberals were pushing for changing the regime or at least experimenting new liberties such as parliamentarism and freedom of the press.Lucien de Rubempr is this young man full of dreams who comes from the French country side eager to live from his literary talents, driven by his forbidden love to a rich aristocrat . Sent away to Paris, little by little Lucien will lose his illusions to discover a world full of greed, machiavellianism and dishonesty.Xavier Giannoli tackles lots of topics in what we understand is a very rich novel. One of the topic is the transformation of literature into merchandise. The depiction of the book publishers is machiavellian. The depiction of a new kind of journalism based on sensacional news is to me even worse. Xavier Giannoli doesn't make a plea for journalists, on the contrary, he even tries to discredit them and presents them as filthy people, greedy for money. It's sometimes a little bit too much but we understand that the new liberties conceded by the government have a repercussion on different fields of the society.We clearly understand that what the director wants to make us some winks thoughout his film, winks that the attentive spectator cannot miss. There is notably the explanation of how the buzz is created among the press, but also how the media (for the time, mainly newspapers) are controlled and owned by rich entrepreneurs or by the big bosses of advertising agencies and how these influencers of the 19th century try to invade the parliament and get the hold of the main positions among the government. The sentence "there will be a time a bankier will be president of the republic" is clearly a wink to our French president Macron.All in all, Xavier Giannoli makes a great adaptation, with a lot of characters and a fine depiction and understanding of the changes that were at stake back in the 19th century and that have a special resonance nowadays."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10510280/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," All the potential went right out the window... ","I have to admit that when I read that the movie was set to take place during the aftermath of an apocalyptic event, I was a bit thrilled and interested in watching this 2021 movie from writer and director Oliver Milburn.And so I did.But the movie wasn't really what I had hoped for. Sure, "School's Out Forever" was watchable, but this was just a movie that ended up being too mundane and bland. It was essentially the storyline that failed to entertain me, as I had expected a bit more from the movie than what it turned out to be.Initially the movie started out alright and it seemed to be heading in the right way as the apocalyptic event started to take place, but then writer and director Oliver Milburn sent the movie on a journey down a sloped hill; a journey from which "School's Out Forever" never bounced back. The story settled into a slump and ended up being nothing more than mediocre actually.It should be noted, though, that the acting performances in the movie were definitely good from everyone on the cast list. So that was certainly something that carried the movie a great long way. And the characters that the actors and actresses had to work with were well enough detailed and fleshed out. Just a shame that the storyline itself sort of sank into the mud and never got back on track.Ultimately, while I managed to sit through the entire ordeal that is "School's Out Forever", then this wasn't a noteworthy or memorable movie experience. It was watchable, yeah, but that was essentially all there was to it.My rating of the 2021 movie "School's Out Forever" lands on a very bland and mediocre five out of ten stars."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10510280/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt"," It was surprisingly quite good, but it could've easily been great ","This is newb filmmaker Oliver Milburn's second full length feature film as editor, writer and director, with only a few previous shorts on his resume. His main forte has been Visual Effects on some popular TV shows, and that talent was evident here.The cinematography and his directing was very impressive, as was the score, landscape and sets. Casting and performances were all great and convincing. This story, adapted from the Schools Out novels by Scott K. Andrews, is cross between Lord Of The Flies, Shaun Of The Dead, Red Dawn and The Road. As a movie, Milburn's screenplay certainly could've used some edits from a seasoned writer. It had some pacing and continuity problems, as well as some plot and technical issues. I felt some scenes were too long and/or unnecessary. I'm sure the sealed letter he held onto (no spoilers) for most of the first act was a metaphor, I think, but it wasn't elaborated. In the 105 min runtime, "a lot" happens in the last 20 minutes, but anything prior felt too long and somewhat unnecessary. It would've been much better if his screenplay had more substance, and less filler, and extending (the best part) more than the 20 mins. Even cutting out much from the early parts and leaving the last 20 mins untouched but with the overall runtime no more than 85-90 mins, I would have enjoyed it much more.Overall for a young newb filmmaker, this UK production was very well executed. Had the writing been tighter, it would have been great. Did I enjoy it enough to recommend it? Yes. Would I see it again? No."

The movie does not go into detail about the virus, but lets just say if it spread with any effectiveness, there wouldn't of been a non-contaminated person in any capacity. Funny the movie makes comments against ownership of guns, but sure highlights two of the needs for them (self preservation, defense against a corrupt government). The concept of using the hostage as an ace in the hole totally got bypassed, as did the concept on being on the same page leadership wise. Give me an intelligent lead instead of someone that flips back and forth between the moral dilemmas in the heat of the battle (and on the other hand, someone that goes total salvage without thinking about their actions).I would give this a 5.5/10 (it is entertaining), but that ending ruined any momentum.

The actors are good for a low budget horror. This one is stepping away from the franchise's normal suburban setting and that's a problem. It's a bit slow for the first half. Most of it is waiting for the obvious demonic story to unfold. In a way, it's blander and less interesting version of Midsommar. The most compelling part is going underground. The most disappointing part is leaving the underground. I would have intensified the second half by staying in the mine and creating a better monster. This is a post-pandemic production although the Amish country doesn't require it. This doesn't feel like Paranormal Activity. It's just another low budget horror."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10515988/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","3"," Paranormal boredom... ","When I sat down to watch the 2021 horror movie "Paranormal Activity: Next of Kin", I must admit that I wasn't really expecting much of anything grand here, as the movies have been dull, uneventful and over-hyped since the very first movie. Yet, I have stuck with the franchise and watched the movies as the years went by, hoping that eventually the franchise would get better.Sadly so, then "Paranormal Activity: Next of Kin" was not the movie that was going to turn the frown upside down. Writer Christopher Landon managed to achieve to keep this seventh movie in the franchise in the same monotonous, dull, uneventful and rather boring atmosphere and pace as the previous six movies. Perhaps that is an achievement in itself actually, keeping the movie on the same level as the previous ones.The storyline told in "Paranormal Activity: Next of Kin" was just downright boring, and you have to get up to about the last 20 minutes or so of the movie before things start to pick up. Just like it has been in every single other "Paranormal Activity" movie, so nothing new there. But by then it is just too little, too late. And so was the case with "Paranormal Activity: Next of Kin" from director William Eubank as well.The acting performances in the movie were adequate, sure. But I can't claim to be able to pinpoint a single performance in "Paranormal Activity: Next of Kin" and say that it was the best or the most memorable. So don't expect to be in for a grand cinematic experience here.Visually then "Paranormal Activity: Next of Kin" was right up alongside with the previous six. So if you enjoy shoddy and questionable camera work, dark footage and barely seeing whatever it is that is doing the paranormal activity, then you are in for a treat. Not really what tickles me all the right places, so I wasn't impressed with "Paranormal Activity: Next of Kin".My rating of "Paranormal Activity: Next of Kin" lands on a generous three out of ten stars. It had potential, but fell into the slump of being just another run-of-the-mill "Paranormal Activity" movie."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10515988/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," More thrilling as a franchise than scary as a stand alone ","I'll start by saying that I prefer to see a paranormal activity movie at the movie theatre vs. At home. I always enjoyed the experience better there.Next of Kin shows how much this genre has change snice the 1st movie. The original just felt raw and amateurish, which did add to the environment of the film. On the other side, we live in a world where far more people know how to make a movie because technology makes it much easier it is now. This also adds to this movie's environment. The original film feels like a documentary while this latest film feels like a narrative pretending to be a documentary film. Both films are the latter and in 2021 next of kin easily gets away with adding a little more polish than what would have been acceptable for the original.Is this an extension of the film franchise? Meaning is this a story connected to the original movie or an original story? I feel like it could be the former but I only see all these movies once so I could not say. Either way, it thought the story was pretty good and had a lot of elements that are similar to the overall story arch of the Paranormal activity franchise. I liked that. The possible trivial connections this story may have to the original makes up for it being exclusive to the small screen.I got the impression that Next of kin is not only furthering the story of Paranormal activity but also furthering the found footage genre it popularized. A lot of the movie is doing the old school format of Paranormal activity (like the recording of the dates). A lot of it I feel I've seen in other found footage movies, particularly, I see them paying homage to the film that started it all: the Blair Witch Project, simply in style and substance.Overall, this one is not nearly as scary as the other ones. Not just because watching a movie like this at home lessons that, but the movie decides on a quicker pace that's going for thrills over fright."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10515988/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," Has nothing that used to make the Paranormal Activity movies great ","'Paranormal Activity' films used to be the staple of every Halloween. They were remarkably consistent right up until the very unfortunate 'Ghost Dimension' which killed the series. Now, years later, we have another entry in the 'Paranormal Activity' series. The only problem is that it is a part of the series in name only. It has no connection to the previous films and it has nothing that demands it be a 'Paranormal Activity' movie. It could be any old found footage film - and not a very good one at that.The original series was so good because it was set in an ordinary looking house like yours or mine. And the thought of your partner spending hours through the night standing over you and staring was simply terrifying. A film set on an Amish farm isn't scary in any way, because who of us is ever going to go to one?A couple of things I did like. They were able to recreate the feel of the series in the first half of the film. It was actually building up quite nicely for a while there until it decided to go well off the rails at the end. The other thing I liked were the main three characters. They were very likeable and people I could get onside with.I feel like I'm mentioning it a lot in films lately, but it needs to be remembered that less is more. This film goes so hard and in your face that it can't possible be scary. What we don't see is always scarier than what we do. This film completely forgets that at the end.I so desperately wanted to like this movie, with the hope that it would reignite a series that I love. This wasn't the storyline to do it with though. This feels like a random found footage film that needed a selling point, and so chucked 'Paranormal Activity' in front of its title. Very disappointing. 5/10."

I've not watched a film from the franchise for several years so I thought I'd check this out and in my opinion, it's more of the same old stuff. I'd say it's great if you like the format, content, paranoid atmosphere and jump scares but just "blah" if it's not really your thing and are just looking to past the time."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10515988/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," Not a Paranormal Activity flick but a barely passable found-footage piece! [+42%] ","It is rather strange to call this a Paranormal Activity film as very little falls in line with what we've come to expect from the franchise - one with declining payoffs. Many sequel makers tried pushing it in different directions, but it could never reach the highs of the first three. Next of Kin feels like just another cult-based found-footage film (with occasional cinematic shots, out of nowhere) that is predictable and filled with poorly staged jumpscares (except one or two, maybe!). Why do horror movie protagonists possibly make the worst decisions ever? It's such a tiresome trope!The film's visual scale is better than it's ever been, and in the hands of William Eubank (who earlier directed Underwater), the atmosphere is built up well in the film's first act. Christopher Landon's screenplay descends into mediocrity very soon, however, making the plot points more obvious and less scary or intriguing with each passing minute. Next of Kin also commits the biggest found-footage mistake; it showcases the demon a tad too much in the final act, taking away even the slightest bit of dread by the time the credits start to roll. The performances, while not terrible, don't help elevate the movie either. At this point, it'd take a lot more effort for a found footage flick to blow my mind."

The Signal was an interesting starting project, Underwater was too rushed and too focused on Steward though.As for the PA franchise, I watched 2 or 3 of these when there was a hype going on, but as it went on it grew old fast so I eventually dropped it.I don't know if this one follows the story or is a standalone film, but as far as these go, it was ok.I enjoyed its atmosphere, the overall look, and, surprisingly enough, the dated found-footage gimmick was certainly used well in this.Obviously, the movie loses a lot if you just ask yourself "why are they still filming?", but in this installment, they seem to mix found footage with a couple of cinematic shots. I actually think that this is a good idea, not wholly original though, since I've seen this done in REC 3: Genesis.Yes, it was predictable and very reminiscent of the first REC or Quarantine, but all the good stuff I mentioned earlier was enough for me to watch it.I think that for a franchise this stretched it was an ok addition.Fans of the franchise might not enjoy it, horror fans might find it too predictable, but it is certainly watchable for the least."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10515988/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","2"," The film was terrible. I kept forgetting I was watching a horror movie. It was that bad ","This franchise should've died after the 2nd one. Specially since the moved apart of the original protagonists. It's cashgrab movie don't watch. Has nothing to do with the previous Paranormal Activity movies and no mention of Kate and Hunter either. Complete garbage!! The writer of this movie probably were a Resident Evil Village fan lmao. They seriously need to put an end to this franchise and that should be with Kate the original character."

"these people are lying to me and filming me in secret and offering animals too some weird ''creature'' at the bottom of a long tunnel in a church that is decorated with demon paintings... , let's stay for just 1 more night and then in the morning I will tell these psycho's that I'm leaving.''.. Sure.. sure. Anyway the entire climax sequence isn't as unsettling. People who are saying the cinematography looks great, no, it is just found footage and nothing cinematic is ever shown. You're better off watching anything else."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10515988/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," The Last Act More Than Makes Up For It ","I'm probably one of those very few people who continue to have a soft spot for this franchise. Don't know about the others, but for me 'Paranormal Activity will forever have a special place in my heart. Cause, it is precisely what introduced me to this rather deserted realm of Found Footage and now being an admirer of the same, I couldn't feel more indebted.Unlike many of their previous iterations, 'Next of Kin' comes alongside a more contemporary approach. Drones, GoPros, Mirrorless Cameras; the advancement of the technology itself has certainly upped their game, at least on a technical level.The same goes for the Audio, which is immaculately mastered with neat sound designing and a nearly flawless combination of Spaciousness & Clarity. Some of the credit must go to the Location too, as it was eerily beautiful and dreadfully empty, all at the same time.Talking of Scares, they are served alright. They often make you feel disgusted, uneasy and most importantly puts you in an isolated space. Characters are surprisingly not as upsetting or idiotic as other films in this genre tend to deliver. Regardless, I'm still not fully convinced about their functionality, as we've still got a lot of blank spaces (In terms of Backstories) to fill.Story and Screenplay wise; I wish there was a bit more elaboration. A lot of the aspects have gone unnoticed or purposefully avoided. The pace is another factor, that seems to have struggled quite a bit, particularly in the mid parts.Luckily, the third act more than makes up for it.Possibly the most intense, and the weirdest segment in the whole film. And by the looks of it; more likely than not, there is a sequel in the offing. As the story has yet to come to a feasible conclusion."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10515988/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," moderately interesting flim marred by bad technical decisions ","Whether by attaching itself to the Paranormal Activity franchise or some other reason, this film commits itself to being a found footage style horror film. This works great for most of the Paranormal Activity films, and even works out nicely for many parts of this film.The problem is that this film was unwilling to fully commit to this, and thus ends up making some really stupid camera decisions that completely draw you out of the immersion of the film and even prompt laughter.The film itself is straightforward: a woman, Margot, who is adopted discovers her birth family is apparently Amish and goes to visit them, all the while bringing a camera, boommike, and two friends, Chris and Dale, to film for a documentary. Who she is and why she apparently warrants a documentary is unclear and ultimately irrelevant.It follows the typical routine of Our Dumb Heroes getting themselves in trouble by ignoring pleas and orders to not do stupid stuff and go exploring forbidden areas, all to further the plot.None of it was particularly interesting. What really stuck out horribly for the film is that, despite the aforementioned commitment to the Paranormal Activity franchise of found footage, the film goes and does so many stupid things that break the format.The most blatant and stupid incident, which I had to rewind just to make sure it actually happened and wasn't me misinterpreting something, involved the cameraperson backing away from "something" in a dark hall. They are alone and have the ONLY camera. The camera then cuts to an object BEHIND the "something", a location the cameraperson was nowhere near and completely unable to film at any point in time.These sorts of impossible camera cuts start to pile up closer to the end, until at one point the camera just seemingly disappears, and we get conventional movie-style shots.... only for the film to somehow return to the "camera"'s framing, as if the camera had been on and filming everything the whole time despite no one holding it.These stupid camera decisions constantly ripped me out of the immersion of the film, and there was one incident in particular where for no reason at all the camera went into a gratuitous slow motion sequence during a scary bit that was too laughable to take seriously and absolutely should have been cut."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10515988/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," Pov 2021 ","It tries to pay homage to the godfather of these found flick shot pov genre Blair Witch Project. It is predictable as it comes and the jump scares were obvious. The main improvement is the camera in which it is shot that is 8k in details. This may come to the film's detriment as the grainy shoots give it a more be authentic element, claustrophobic feel that makes the viewers more sympathetic towards the protagonists plight. The last scenes remind me of playing Outlast."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10515988/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","1"," Hollow Activity: More of Fakeness ","Some franchises should remain dead. Paranormal Activity left us three creepy enough movies (1-3), an extremely weak fourth entry, a shallow fifth one and a god awful final outing that was for the laughs. I was expecting this to be at least better than that 'Ghost Dimension'. Imagine my anger when I discover this 'Next Of Kin' is actually the worst of the series. It looks faker than ever, populated by terribly (and so lame acted) stupid characters, crushingly bad dialogue, an exaggeratedly boring story and even the daring choice of betraying the effective POV style in order to add external cinematic shots and even a soundtrack. I can see why Paramount skipped cinemas with this."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10515988/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Predictable but good ","I've always been a fan of the Paranormal Activity movies. I think this is one of the better films in the series. There was a few twists here and there but a lot of it was fairly predictable. You'd have to be oblivious if you didn't figure out the plot after the first 30 minutes. Either way I still enjoyed this film. I liked the new concept and most importantly it held my attention. Definitely a film worth checking out."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10515988/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," Stupid ","I came from King Richard and jumped to this. My brain is asking: are you joking?I really like that they tried to do something different. They tried to put some new blood in a franchise that is dead and with no ideas to evolve, but boy, at least do it right. The cult/folk thing is interesting but if you don't go any deeper than symbols or a Google search is just like any other cheap horror film.The acting was mostly good, but there are too many stupid decisions (blame the writers, not the actors). I mean...I'm probably not the bravest person in the world, but who the hell in the entire world would go down on that gigantic man-made hole covered in blood just because they are curious? That is "a bit" too much. And it's too much when you find out that some people had been stalking you for months and because the next village is 30 miles away, "oh, let's sleep one more night here with these crazy people, tomorrow will be a new day". Are you joking? People run 26 miles every week around the world. Without a cult chasing them!Well, the last 20 minutes are good. There are some interesting scenes, everybody screaming, doing crazy things and a cool design from the "prisoner". That's it."

This was one of those movies. Let me first say if you do NOT like found footage you will not appreciate this movie. Although the start was VERY slow... the end was extremely powerful that energy at the end was what I had hope for the whole movie to be but it just wasn't. I honestly jumped a few times so it was not all bad.I have seen all of the P. A's and this one was my favorite so far. The creepy elements were just enough to keep you on edge, but still had you logically asking why the lead was not shaking in the freezing cold in nothing but a tank top. Also loved Dale, he was the reason I kept watching tbh. I would not mind seeing a pt. 2, where Margot is prego and has to sacrifice her bby to save the already crumbling world. Now that I would watch!"

Next of Kin reminded me of The Shrine gone horribly wrong... scary movie, solid story.This movie reminds me a lot of THE SHRINE."

The acting wasn't bad, but I really hate the shaky camera thing. Makes me a bit nauseous. It was a bit creepy, but it simply lacked. But...I have seen worse. Peace."

You expect franchises to get better with every movie, not get worse, or stagnate.A very, very, very basic premise...and a paper thin, overused script. Nothing new in relation to any of the previous instalments. One thing the PA filmmakers always seem to do well, is make decent movies with relatively unknown actors.I think this would of been better received if it was a standalone movie, with no links to the PA universe.Not great, but not awful by any means. A few good jumpscares...and some great tension-building scenes.Spoiled by a weak ending.I still think 'The Marked Ones' is the one to beat."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10515988/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," A decent addition to the PA franchise ","A lot of people said that this movie was boring, and to some people it might come off as boring, but to me personally, I actually liked the idea of switching it up from being inside some rich person's house, with a pool, and all of the amenities anybody could possibly ask for, to just a rag tag team making a documentary that makes absolutely no sense, with people who seem Amish, but when you ask the mailman, they aren't. There were some genuinely creepy parts, but in true paranormal activity fashion, get ready for some jump scares, because there are more than a few. I was thoroughly entertained by this new installment, and if they made it more like this, I would watch more, but again, it's all up to the person. It's worth a try."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10520754/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," Do NOT Sleep On This Film ","In the shadow of meeting his fiancee's White parents, a Black Man is haunted by visions of his roots and has to come to terms with his lingering anger. Boom, off the bat, we realize we are in some mystical metaphysical conversation when we first see Man floating in a resting position above his bed. The dreamlike image conjures up spirituality. This is seared into our minds as to what follows. Man, embarks on attempts to have meaningful conversation about race which is struck down or sidestepped by banal life moments. One, when a friend visits from his past, and again when his fiancee attempts to diffuse his queries as to what future they hold together. Or where he fits in. Anyone who has the anxiety of meeting parents before nuptials will understand this fear. Multiply it by 1000 when race is involved. To comfort that fear White Woman, as she's listed as, explains that her parents are opened minded liberals similar to how "Get Out" starts. But this is serious. And he is serious. What he truly wants to get at and no one can truly articulate to him, is the life experience of being inside a body that is shunned silently by the crowd. Regardless of how many people tell him that skin color doesn't matter.No folks, this ISN'T that you need to pity him, or comfort him. It's the existential question of whether or not his fear of his fellow man wasn't indoctrinated into him throughout generations. These are metaphysical questions that perfectly match the images you are about to witness. And anyone of color will constantly consider which is...what we wouldn't give for our ability to change the course of objects or minds. It is a seriously deep conversation I've never seen portrayed, and frankly is a work of genius that hasn't been addressed. Man is in a constant battle with this question and will ring true for a LOT of viewers. By the way, this has NOTHING to do with the present conversation of race. Director Skinner Myer's film is more than that. It is about when the White liberals leave the spotlight or social media platform, he still must live within his skin. The present conflict is a scratch on the surface compared to the darker roots. That said, there are moments of humanity and warmth and humor. Uncomfortable humor at that, but still humorous. And Rae Dawn Chong deserves much attention as Black Woman. Incredible. As does Skinner's very understated but boiling performance as the Man. There are truly beautiful moments of true art. Excellent film! I would be interested in seeing Mr. Myers direct one of Stephen King's dramas. He really tightropes that line of mystical and spiritual well and would do well similar tonally to a "Shawshank Redemption" control."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10521144/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Entertaining family horror movie... ","As I sat down to watch the 2021 Netflix movie "Nightbooks", I must admit that I wasn't really expecting much from writers Mikki Daughtry and Tobias Iaconis, given this being a family horror movie. But still, I opted to watch "Nightbooks" as I hadn't already seen it.Turns out that writers Mikki Daughtry and Tobias Iaconis actually managed to churn out a script that was actually surprisingly entertaining. And yeah, "Nightbooks" is a family horror movie, but a very enjoyable one actually. So I am more than happy that I opted to give director David Yarovesky's 2021 movie "Nightbooks" a chance.The storyline told in "Nightbooks" was interesting and actually rather captivating as well. The story starts out quite nicely and keeps a great pace all throughout the course of the movie. The narrative is rather well-written and provides excellent entertainment.The acting performances in "Nightbooks" were good. It was actually loads of fun to see Krysten Ritter playing a villanous role as she did here, and she really carried the movie quite well. It should also be said that Winslow Fegley (playing Alex) and Lidya Jewett (playing Yasmis) really were well-casted for the movie and they put on good performance opposite of someone like Krysten Ritter. So the movie definitely had a great cast ensemble.Visually then "Nightbooks" was interesting and had good effects. I was genuinely entertained and impressed with what I saw on the screen. And for a family horror movie, then "Nightbooks" did quite well for itself.If you have the opportunity to sit down and watch "Nightbooks", you should do so, because this family horror movie has something to offer everyone in the family. So believe me when I say that "Nightbooks" is quite well-worth watching.My rating of "Nightbooks" lands on a six out of ten stars."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10521144/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","1"," Terrible production values ","Yeah, I'm reviewing a kids program which was rated TVPG but in all honesty the production is very low level. The number of stupid parlor tricks, blurred cut scenes, flashing lights on and off, and the kiddie screams is really annoying. I didn't find anything fun about the production, the whinny kids or the ten cent witch were bottom of the barrel for production quality. The plot was a good idea, but the execution was a failure. I don't blame the kids, but the director told them to be annoyingly over acting for the task. The only thing worth the one star is the stop motion animation."

It's perfect for people who love a scary movie, but may regret watching it at night (like me!). It has the just right amount of scary moments to give you a thrill, but also doesn't keep you up at night.Nightbooks follows the story of a boy named Alex (Winslow Fegley) who loves to write scary stories. While trying to find the boiler room in his apartment complex, he is lured into a witch's (Krysten Ritter) house, who steals children. He meets Yasmin, who is also stuck there. Can they make it out before they face certain doom? Watch the movie to find out.This film is based on the book by the same title, so fans of the book should love the movie. The set has so much attention to detail and the costume design, especially for Natacha the witch, is immaculate because all of her outfits perfectly express her personality. The special effects, specifically for the monsters, are so realistic that it gave me chills. My favorite character is Lenore the "sometimes" invisible cat because she has such a mind of her own.The message is to never lose hope and always be yourself. Just because people think you are different doesn't mean that you are bad. There is some bad language and some scary parts that young kids find scary.I give Nightbooks 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 8 to 18, plus adults. This movie releases September 15, 2021 on Netflix. By Katherine S., KIDS FIRST!"

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10521144/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Mixture of Hocus Pocus, Tales from the Darkside: The Movie, and Hansel and Gretel that makes for an intense yet family-friendly good time. ","Alex (Winslow Fegley) is a young boy who loves all things horror/scary to the point he writes his own stories. Alex's interests are seen as "weird" by his classmates and one night in a bout of frustration he decides to burn his collections of scary stories he's written called "Nightbooks". While taking an elevator down to the basement, the elevator stops at a dark hallway where he is lured into an apartment by an unseen force. Alex finds out the apartment belongs to a witch named Natacha (Krysten Ritter) who initially plans to kill him, but after learning of his penchant for conjuring scary stories Natacha keeps him for the purposes of telling one scary story a night with only one unbreakable rule: no happy endings! Along with Alex and Natacha the apartment is also inhabited by a magic cat named Lenore and another child, Yazmin (Lidya Jewett), who serves as Natacha's housekeeper/gofer. Isolated in the witch's library for hours on end, Alex comes across messages left by one of the previous child prisoners that hints at a possible means of escape.Based on the 2018 horror-fantasy children's book of the same name by J. A. White, Nightbooks was acquired for adaptation by Netflix in 2019. Written by screenwriting team Mikki Daughtry and Tobias Iaconis, whose previous credits include The Curse of La Llorona and Five Feet Apart, and directed by David Yarovesky, who previously gave us the Superman inspired horror film Brightburn, the film has a lot of potential behind the scenes along with the producing prowess of Sam Raimi through his Ghost House label. The movie doesn't go as far with its premise as it could have, but it's an enjoyable family film with a frightful edge that makes for good Halloween season viewing.Winslow Fegley who previously headlined the Disney+ original Timmy Failure: Mistakes Were Made and will next be seen in the upcoming comedy film, 8-Bit Christmas, is well cast as Alex. Fegley makes a sympathetic lead playing Alex as a frustrated outsider who has a love of horror and the macabre and he makes the character worth rooting for. A big part of Alex's arc is in self-acceptance in how he grows to hate the thing he loved because it didn't measure up with how other people thought he should be, and it's a good message for kids not to let other people's superficial standards dictate who you are. Lidya Jewett is also good as a harder edged character, Yazmin, who's cynical and pessimistic from having been held captive by the witch for an untold amount of time, and there's some great creative sequences at play such as a sequence where Alex and Yazmin have to tackle and infestation on the witch's Night Nursery which houses all manner of bizarre and unworldly plants. The production design is also quite impressive with the witch's apartment adorned in all manner of imagery ranging from creepy and foreboding to magical and wonderous. Then of course we have Krysten Ritter as the witch Natacha and she is absolutely fantastic easily placing herself on the same level as other movie witches bringing both the threatening elegance of Angelica Huston's Grand High Witch from 1990s The Witches and the playful campiness of Bette Middler's Winnie Sanderson from Hocus Pocus. Ritter balances the camp and threat of her character owing every scene she's in with gleefully palpable duplicity.The one downside is the titular Nightbooks feel very brushed over. When we're first introduced to Alex's Nightbooks, we're given a short story called "The Playground" where a red background and simplistically drawn environments are filled with live action actors who all speak with Alex's voice, it's a creative technique for conveying Alex's stories because it captures that feeling of something written by a child that also has that horror "edge" to it. My primary issue is that aside from that story and one later (that's more plot relevant) we never see this style utilized again and it feels like a squandered opportunity as it reminded me of something like the animation seen in Middle School: The Worst Years of My Life or Diary of a Wimpy Kid where it played with simplistic animation to bring childlike fantasies to life, and while we do get two here that are really well done, it does feel like it wasn't taken full advantage of.Nightbooks is a fun horror film that can be enjoyed by families. While it doesn't quite reach the pinnacle of the best family horror films it comes pretty close. The three principle actors are all fantastic with Krysten Ritter in particular making for a fantastic villain. While the movie doesn't run full force with all its ideas, it's an intelligent and well made film that promises and delivers on Halloween fun."

A kid who loved writing horror stories got trapped by a witch in her moving apartment, and with a friend they tried to escape the witch.I guess Halloween must be very close because this movie definitely belongs to the event. It's not a terrible movie. The visuals were great and magical, making some scene pretty intense. The kids were okay, but my favorite part was of course Krysten Ritter as the wicked and glamorous witch. She still had the sassiness from Jessica Jones. However, I wished she had more screen time because she was great whenever she was on the screen.Then, this movie wasn't too good either. I did not flinch at any of the jump-scares that were thrown at me. This movie was a bit creepy, but for sure not scary. The story itself wasn't all that interesting, but at least I was not bored.Overall, an okay horror movie that kids or families can watch and had some fun at night or during Halloween season. 6/10."

Its also based off the book that I might check out.I like the plot, the acting and the visuals of the stories they show also the Nightbook stories were interesting.The rest is clearly a scary movie that kids can watch and probably can be scared by the visuals and the monsters shown through out.But I will give credit to the creepy and disturbing scenes and imagery they got away with on the monsters and the witch, even the 3rd act was disturbing.In the end its a creepy kids movie that kids can tolerate, but also it has creepy imagery and disturbing scenes that they can enjoy."

The near-perfect technical side of the production is only let down by some unconvincing cat CGI. Acting was excellent. Really great casting. Love the story and how it was told. The creative side of the production was only let down by some uneven pacing in the first half where it occasionally lost our attention. This is a great family horror, if you can take it! I loved the subtle The Evil Dead (1981) references."

","While the poster makes it seem like an Artemis Fowl type of release.. it isn't.At first glance, and judging by the content and dialogue at the start, it seems like this is a release for kids. But this Netflix release is a bit more scary than that. In fact, it's a bit confusing on who this is meant for.. still watchable! Very reminiscent of the Goosebumps TV show.Every time Krysten Ritter was on screen, I couldn't stop thinking how Eva Green would tackle the role, and how much better it would be. Still, I quite liked her (specially the costume design). The kids are good too! Though they feel weirdly written for their age. As if too smart and fearless, straight out of a fairy tale. But considering..It's fine.With good pacing, interesting cinematography and intriguing premise.. and understanding what it is, it would be hard to be disappointed. Even it it is very formulaic, there are enough twists to make an evening out of it."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10521144/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," Unbearable. Very poor watch. ","Was hoping to like it but yeah, that didn't happen. The art design is good of those fluorescent scenes but that's about it. The whole movie takes place in that one house except for some parts later on in the film. It makes you feel claustrophobic and is thusly boring as well. The plot is somewhat interesting but the stories aren't. I was expecting some good spooky stories with well imagined visuals but all I got was some childish animation with a red background. As I said before the stories are also quite lame. This movie has all the bad things. It is mediocre in every aspect. The screenplay is the worst part. It fails to keep you hooked as it's too simple not quite interesting.Skip it. It's a waste of time. Also I'm sure your kids won't find it interesting. Watch Coraline instead which is a very beautiful- animated movie having a similar plot as this and is much much better."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10521144/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," Not recommended for adults ","It's super mediocre. I wanted to watch a modern children's movie, but they are all off and mediocre. Just like old children's movies really. At least now you get way better effects and a bit better acting. But largely it's not good movies. Maybe kids will like it? I can't say. It's a very basic story, the acting is acceptable to good. And the script is very mediocre at best. Often the characters just stand around and do nothing instead of trying to get themselves out of danger which is extremely lazy screenwriting and feels frustrating. A lot of smart decisions could have been made here, but weren't.My main issue with this movie is the editing. They use multiple cameras and we constantly jump from person to person in dialogues. We get a lot of crooked shots from all angles and you have about a shot per second I think. The camera jumps from place to place even in calm scenes and you get dizzy and confused everywhere. The acting is also over the top. As I said the characters often just stand around in fear and look at the danger so you have a ton of scenes where the kids just scream or act sad which is where the movie really fails. Both the kids are good enough actors in calm scenes, but when the little boy needs to show any emotional range he is horrible. I'm not panning him. Rather the director should have guided the actors much better and made sure they could act out roles that fit their skills. Instead a good enough actor is forced to act out scenes he is just not skilled enough to do and the director clearly guides him into terrible decisions that make for bad scenes.For adults this is a skip. It's not bad or boring. It just feels pointless and tame. The main story issue is how rushed the background story is. We are just put into the magical apartment while getting zero background info. So you can't even properly root for anyone as nothing here is introduced emotionally. Rather everything is introduced via dialogue. So if you want to know what they care for or what families they are from it's in the dialogue only. For a children's movie this is an especially horrible decision. It's also just lazy and bad writing for such a big production. The emotional pull in this movie is minimal at best because everything emotional is dialogue only.But having said all that, just because it's not a good movie doesn't mean kids won't like it. Kids like plenty of terrible movies with bad plots. They may like this one if they like PG rated horror movies. It's also a bit better than the typical children's movie. That's not saying a lot, but there are some very great sets here that I did enjoy. Especially the library."

His mother Kate Mayfield (Mira Sorvino) runs the family video game company but she doesn't want him to work there. After he gets suspended from school, he scares off his mother's angel investor. The company is in trouble. Troy fixes the company's only game created by lead programmer Jimmy Tisdale (Sean Astin). His mother gives him control of the game but his idea may be too big and time is short.I don't know anything about the Carpenter family. This seems to be a real indie affair with this family writing a script and getting it made. I give them full marks for effort. The story has some good ideas but sadly, it also has some bad ideas. The worst is the kid decides to make a whole new game in a month. That is ridiculous. A better idea would be that he already has written the game. They could spend the time adapting it. It's still not enough time but at least, that is not beyond reason. The final solution has the same issue with unreasonable programming. Finally, I hate the programming montages. I hate the spinning around and around. It reminds of Hackers in a bad way. That move fits the silliness of Hackers but this one is in desperate need of believability. They could have steered into the low rent production by doing a simple fast forward. It's also possible for him to not just sit in front of the computer. Despite the general unrealistic world, this story has some good elements and it has a great cast. The kids are fine. This just needs to clean up the unrealistic parts."

","I sat down to watch the 2021 sci-fi horror movie "Let Us In" mostly because the movie had Tobin Bell on the cast list, but also because this was a horror movie that I hadn't already seen.And I suppose that "Let Us In" is aimed at a younger audience than me, because director Craig Moss' movie fell short of providing me with proper entertainment. But hey, suppose you are a pre-teen viewer, then I guess that "Let Us In" will fall into your liking.The storyline here was just simply a bit too ludicrous for my liking, and it was so difficult to take the aliens, known as Jungspars, serious in any way. I just gave up on trying to let the concept sink in and sweep me away, it just provided me with no enjoyment.The acting in the movie was actually fair enough, but the actors and actresses had very little to work with in terms of a proper script and storyline. So it was a struggle to sit through this movie. Tobin Bell wasn't really in the movie for all that long, which I found to be a shame.My rating of the 2021 movie "Let Us In" lands on a mere three out of ten stars."

Yes I give credit for the first part of the movie it was a very interesting story. Then they threw in Aliens and although I love a good sci-fi as much as the next person, this movie had me rolling my eyes. Reading another review posted, I hope this movie didn't cost $20mil to make! No real special effects or moments that wowed you at all. This movie was all on the actors shoulders and although they acted well I still could not help be feel like my time was wasted on this movie. I was watching it with my 11 yo, and some how by the end he had snuck out and was playing his tablet. It felt like they tried to put all the new slag kids use now a days inside this WHOLE movie, which made it salty af *Eye Roll*. I do not recommend this movie unless you have small children who love aliens or are too scared from the traditional scary movie. It felt like a below average movie, and nothing close to Goosebumps like another review said. Goosebumps was way above this movie, ijs. Last *Eye Roll*."

I was going to tank the review in the beginning because Luke and Carly are within 20 feet of lots of kids, yet they are supposedly unable to yell or to find them, and the news report says there were no witnesses. As the movie progressed, I felt it was not so relevant because this is NOT an adult film, so it requires a different approach. Ms. Moss is a natural actress. Looking forward to her future roles.

","To set the record straight, "Let Us In" was made on a low budget of $ 700K.I know that for a fact. The other reviewer is very incorrect. This is a wonderful family movie, best described as Disney-ish with an edge. It stars a 12 year old who plays a 12 year old. Usually they get someone much older to play kids. All the young actors were actually the ages they played. Mackenzie Moss was amazing. The range and quality of her performance was impressive, as well as the rest of the cast. This is not a 'horror' movie. It is a heartwarming story of a girl who must find her way in the ruthless world of middle school while trying to save kidnapped kids who earlier bulled her. It has creepy parts and scary parts, but, as Tobin Bell (Jigsaw) said, this is a 'gateway' movie for horror that the whole family can enjoy and watch. Tobin Bell loves this movie and the amazing actors in it. My 5 year old granddaughter loved it, as well did I. Craig Moss (filmmaker & director) , did a phenomenal job, shooting only 14 days with kids, who have tutors and restricted hours, unexpected rains, and getting such a stellar cast and crew for so little. This film does what it was created to do. Tell an engrossing story about life, kids, school, friendships, hardships and persevering. Nothing new, but a lot of fun. Thanks."

I enjoyed the second viewing just as much the first. The acting from the child stars is top notch. The cast is filled with up and coming stars. Many have active television shows they are on currently. Definitely a tighter budget movie (no noticeable CGI), but it has a great script. The editing is top notch as well. I am looking for to the sequel. I recommend grabbing the entire family, some popcorn and maybe even some root beer floats and enjoying a quality family movie together."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10533804/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","2"," Avoid this film. "I'm as serious as a tornado." ","Admittedly, I was quite baffled when I saw this film pop up in a brief New York Times article by Jeannette Catsoulis. Her somewhat favorable review, alongside comparisons to other iconic tween-centric properties such as The Goonies and Stranger Things, drew my morbid curiosity and I decided to view this film with an open mind, trying to stymie doubts about its quality and not go in to my viewing set out to dislike it. What transpired over this film's runtime left me confused and frustrated. Let's discuss!This film was entirely bereft of atmosphere, compelling characters, and charm. The screenplay is shallow and predictable, relying almost completely on obvious, lazy tropes and formulas, from "Tragic Backstory = Instant Sympathetic Protagonist" to "Comic-Relief Sidekick" and all areas in-between. The characters, sequence of events, and set pieces are uninspired and derivative at best. When one inspects the filmography of the film's writer-director Craig Moss, who is responsible for gems such as "The 41-Year-Old Virgin Who Knocked Up Sarah Marshall and Felt Superbad About It" and "30 Nights of Paranormal Activity with the Devil Inside the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," one can understand immediately the quality to be expected from "Let Us In."The script is so absent of creativity, it comes as no surprise that the performances of the actors and actresses involved are milquetoast and wooden, even from Tobin Bell of the "Saw" franchise, who is criminally underutilized as the "Creepy Town Weirdo" stereotype. At no point did I believe that there was confidence or energy placed in this film, both on-screen and off-screen. The cinematography is sterile and conventional, nothing is presented in an engaging or visually interesting manner to give this film any kind of identity. The score for this film is so painfully generic that I am convinced it was comprised exclusively of royalty-free music, it was that unbearable. The sheer volume of failures this film accumulates adds up over its runtime, resulting in an exponentially tedious experience.Now if one wants to defend this film and its overwhelming wealth of flaws on the basis that it is a family-friendly horror film, that is very misguided. Having a family-friendly film of any kind, regardless of genre, does not necessitate a severe lack of quality and craftsmanship. The films "Coraline" and "Monster House" as well as the show "Gravity Falls" are prime examples of accessible, spooky, family-friendly media that have charm, are engaging and entertaining, and do not wallow in tedium and mediocrity. If the work is done and the effort is put in, then you'll never have to sacrifice quality for accessibility for all ages.In short, "Let Us In" is a stellar role-model of what to avoid in filmmaking. If you as a viewer enjoy well-rounded characters, an intriguing premise, good humor, consistent internal logic, self-awareness, a half-decent script, and good chills, then do not waste your time with this, there are so many better options to choose from."

For a much better film on BEK, check out Hulu's Into the Dark: They Come Knocking. Much more true to the paranormal research."

It's an emotional shot in the arm but it hits right in the heart and everywhere else where it hurts. A very-well and shot movie with some very good dialogue writing despite the contrived plot and nearly 3-hour-long running time. Recommended."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10534500/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," FILM OF THE YEAR!! And likely to remain so. Home is an Emotional Masterpiece journey into your life which you live daily but don't actually Live it. ","#Home (2021) : Movie Review -Malayalam Cinema is unstoppable in 2021. From Classics like 'The Great Indian Kitchen', 'Operation Java', 'Drishyam 2', 'Nayattu' to other great films like 'Aarkkariyam', 'Malik' and 'Kututhi' to couple of more notable films like 'Joji' and 'Cold Case', Malayalam Cinema is giving away quality content with open hands. I have seen all these films so now i am eligible to state my opinion clearly. "#Home" is FILM OF THE YEAR so far and is likely to remain so because it is almost impossible to bring such an outstanding content in so great manners. For me, #Home has also surpassed Bollywood, Telugu and Tamil Classics of this year. It is a film that takes you on a journey into your own daily life, into your family, into your emotions to teach you everything about the same Life which you are living but actually not Living but just passing your days in today's Digital era.Home is tremendously rich in writing departement. No other family comes close to this and neither will come i guess. I am considering all the great family dramas while saying this right from Oscar Winning 'How Green Was My Valley', George Steven's 'I Remember Mama' to Bollywood Films to modem foreign language films like 'My Father and My Son' (2005). Yes, #Home beats them all because it is not just about family, it is about lots of other things too which can't be explained here. You have to see it, experience it and understand it on your own and then you'll never ever forget it that's my promise. Each and every small small nuances here are notable and life-changing, it's just about your understanding level and if you have it solid then make it more solid because this film might just demolish your thinking power.From performance to technical aspects to everything you name under cinematic aspects, #Home is an expert's tutorial book. Not only for viewers but also for filmmakers on how to plant cinematic nuances within dramatic limits. It may not be excessive and agressive about telling the facts, i mean you won't see any lectures from the characters, that's old school filmmaking almost 50 years old. Here, #Home tries the leap method, it just hints about the subtle meaning of the scenes and runs away for the next scene only to leave you all alone with your acknowledgement power.I actually wanted to talk about many scenes and to elaborate the subtle meaning and artistic values of it but i am leaving it open for you all. Who knows, you might understand something better than me and anyways who gives spoilers before recommending a Must Watch Film? Rojin Thomas hasn't done anything extraordinary till date and that's a correct statement too if we consider his previous projects but now with this film i can say that the things have changed. With #Home , he has delivered that EXTRAORDINARY MASTERPIECE which is more than enough for me to remember his name forever. What a marvelous designing of sensible subject it is. I am truly speechless Thomas sir. Hats off man. Overall, #Home is film which mustn't be missed by anybody, whoever he or she is, whatever the age is, just watch it with your whole family and try to understand the mistakes you have done unknowingly and if possible then confess it. Eventually, #Home will make your imperfect life PERFECT! ! It is a bridge between three generations and we all have or had them in our families, no?RATING - 9/10*"

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10534500/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," A heart-warming, feel-good flick that's best enjoyed with the fam! [+72%] ","The best thing about #Home is that it gives a veteran performer like Indrans an opportunity (in 2021) to act his heart out. #Home is everything you can expect given its title. Thematically, it heavily borrows from Sreenivasan's Kadha Parayumbol in its climactic moments but writer-director Rojin Thomas successfully infuses a huge dose of relatability to the proceedings before we get there. The (slightly excessive) melodrama in the end makes me reduce half a star in a film that gets its humor going pretty early on. Everyone on the film's poster (or otherwise) does well - conveying the right emotions with ease.Rojin has written the lead character of Oliver Twist (Indrans, playing the man of the house) in a layered manner. Right when you think the focus goes away from the sexagenarian, Rojin carefully drifts it back on him. It also tries to convey a subtle message on mobile phone addiction without being outright preachy about it. As it's a 2h 40m movie, #Home spends enough and more time breathing life into each of its leads. The comedy is laugh-out-loud when it works and super-bland when it doesn't; that said, it's the former that we get more of. #Home looks like it was prepared to delight (and occasionally moisten the eyes of) family audiences during the Cor-Onam season when Keralites are mostly stuck at home.The gripes I had with the film include a few problematic quips around mental health, how Antony's somewhat toxic behavior gets written off as "stress" and is conveniently forgiven, and that Kuttiyamma (Manju Pillai) gets reduced to the empathetic caretaker of all the men in the household. Also, why does Antony want his dad to be extra-ordinary for them to reconnect? Most dads are ordinary and they're still awesome for just being themselves. That aside, #Home certainly warrants a watch with the fam.P. S - Dominic Toretto must be feeling proud!"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10534500/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," #Home is where the heart is! ","Yes, this movie is full of heart. Having a rough day, go home and watch this movie. Have free time, watch this movie. It's totally worth it.#Home perfectly fits the description of a 'feel-good movie'. It has a wonderful wonderful screenplay that'll make you completely fall in love with this movie. It's long enough (in a good way) to make you completely immersed in the characters and the story. You may not necessarily like it in the beginning, but it slowly grows on you. If I'm being completely honest, I didn't like some of the main characters in the beginning. I had problems with them all. For eg, I did not like the dad (Oliver Twist Sr., which you'll understand when you watch the film), Antony OT (Srinath Bassi), and the younger brother even as I found his antics annoying and he was too loud. But as the film progressed I started understanding the reasons behind why they were how they were. Many things that feel a little hard to believe, you'll get closure on those things as it moves ahead. The script is honestly extremely good and the movie has this sense of realism that'a conveyed to you beautifully. That's the beauty about Malayalam cinema. They feel so realistic and relatable, you will absolutely love their stories.This is that kind of film that's going to be remembered for a long long time. For eg, Dhrishyam, Kumbalangi which are absolute classics. Yes, there are a lot of Malayalam movies that are insanely good, but these two classics come to mind instantly when you think about supremely wonderful Indian films. This movie #Home is the latest addition to that list. Simply brilliant! Nuff said. You can't miss this film at any cost. Please watch it in your free time or on a lazy Sunday afternoon.10/10 from me."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10534500/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Indrans and Manju Pillai shine in this heartwarming family drama! ","Despite immense performance in indie films like Veyilmarangal and Aalorukkam, finally comedian turned ace character actor Indrans gets a mainstream lead role that he could sink his teeth into.He stars as the aptly named Oliver Twist, a technologically challenged dad desperately trying to reconnect with his young sons. Manju Pillai plays his hot-tempered, bickering wife and the two veterans play off each other to really hook the audience from the word go.Sreenath Bhasi essays the role of a typical disconnected, spoiled elder son who has taken his parents for granted while finding his feet as a young film director.Although Director Rojin Thomas leverages his brilliant leads to generate excellent feel good moments, the attempts at comedy often fall flat. At 2 hours and 40 minutes, the film is too long especially since the narration meanders to unnecessary sub-plots at many points.Johny Antony is a delight as Indrans' best friend and generates the few genuine laughter-inducing comic sequences while Vijay Babu and Deepa Thomas come off as stiff and artificial in their supporting roles. Nelsen K Gafoor delivers his second superb performance on the trot after his standout role in Kuruthi, again, interestingly as a temperamental younger sibling.At its very core, #Home is an endearing father-son story and one that hits very close to (pun intended) home. Despite its many flaws, the film is elevated by the monumental performance of Indrans who makes you buy into the out-of-touch father's helplessness and his unending plight to win his son's approval.#Home will definitely bring a smile to your face by the climax and make you question, reassess and maybe even correct your dynamic with your own parents.Recommended."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10534500/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," Engaging After The Dragging First Hour ","I watched Home (2021) on Primevideo in orig. Malayalam w/Eng. Subs. Run Time: A lengthy 2hrs 40mn !!!Most reviewers are raving about this film but to be honest, I found it needlessly dragging and quite boring for the first one hour. The story picked up thereafter and was quite engaging till the end.The plot essentially revolves around a family living in Trivandrum. Indrans is the father Oliver Twist (yes really !!!), retired from his defunct VCR business, now tending with much love and care his organic terrace garden. He is a simple amiable person who is not familiar with smart phones and devices . Oliver also cares for his ailing elderly father (Appachan / Kainakary Thankaraj) who is quite a character in his own right. Oliver's wife Kuttiyamma (Manju Pillai) is a sharp tongued harried housewife. Oliver's elder son Anthony (Sreenath Bhasi) is a one super hit film director who lives in Ernakulam. Oliver's younger son Charles (Nalsen - Rasul from Kuruthi) is a typical messy teenager mostly busy with YouTube vlogs and social media. Both sons are indifferent to the travails of their parents and not particularly proud of their father, traits not at all unusual with many families in todays age. This is shown very well in the film which most viewers would easily relate with.Antony is struggling to finish his second film script which must be approved by superstar Vishal (Anoop Menon). His boss gives him an ultimatum of 2 weeks and he goes to his family home in TVM to complete the story. Antony gifts his father a smart phone. Oliver takes the help of his best friend Surya (Johny Antony) to learn how to use his new device, FB, Insta, WhatsApp etc. Oliver tags along with Antony to meet superstar Vishal, and without his sons knowledge, he enters Vishal's vanity van. Vishal is quite accommodating and chats politely with Oliver. However he rejects Antony's script.A dejected Antony already stressed with EMI payment defaults and girlfriend problems, rants to his father about his plight including some unsavoury comments about Vishal. Unfortunately while fiddling with his new smartphone Oliver has put on FB Live Streaming and Antony's entire diatribe goes viral with predictable consequences for his career.Watch the film to see how this narrative plays out.The acting is good especially Indrans who is outstanding as the father Oliver Twist; most scenes are quite realistic, family relationships are accurately portrayed.What brings the film down is the inordinately long length of 2hrs 40mn of which the first hour as mentioned earlier, is almost boring and not worthy of more than a 2/5 rating. In today's OTT times, shorter films hold the audience interest better. However once the film picks up, it is quite engaging, poignant and has a feel good ending."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10534500/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Indrans shines but it dawdles at times ","A feel-good movie about a father-son relationship ... it is somewhat dilly-dallying with mostly run-of-the-mill performances except protagonist Indrans who steals the show, unnecessary screaming and slapdash superfluous sequences... although story is predictable but it does not fail to hold one's interest and touch one's heartstrings, it is along the similar lines to the short stories by O'Henry or RK Narayan. If it was a 90 minute movie then I might have given higher rating... it's still a good watch .."

Must Watch..."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10534500/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," For me, this was a good movie that could have been a brilliant movie. ","Home has a simple, relatable, light-hearted, feel-good story. As a movie it has some great acting, is brilliantly shot and....and, for me, it is a good movie when it should have been great or even brilliant! Hear me out.The movie starts with a "Try not to check your phone for a bit" and then goes on to talk about generation gap, "technological" handicap, detached (and sometimes ungrateful) children, mental health, reliance on social media and related anxiety, life - legacy - achievements, stupid misunderstandings, etc. It also touches on the fact that your home is your inner circle, your nonjudgment zone, a place where you can be yourself. I loved the fact that it says everyone's got a story to tell, everybody has life experiences that mean something.My only gripe with the movie is that, what all that necessary for 2hr41mins? I'd have enjoyed the movie even it they'd picked only one out of social media/anxiety/legacy/family/mental health/ misunderstandings/ parent-children relationship/generation gap. Which, at the end of the movie, the story does narrow down to two out of all of those, in which case, we could have done without of the rest of it and it would have still been fine. Personally, the movie was trying to do too much, and it felt long. Others don't seem to mind.I understand that Indrans is a legendary Malayalam actor, he did a brilliant job playing the lead and the supporting cast did so too around him. The movie was also shot really well, the visuals were enjoyable - watch it in a dark room, the colors were really good. The sound effects really added to the message that the movie was trying to convey in the first 40 mins; a message which IMO, ends up being irrelevant towards the end of the movie.All that said, this was a good movie that you'll relate to, at least in parts for sure. It is also a feelgood movie that you can enjoy with your family."

If it could have shartned to two hours it could be a solid pack. Anyhow if you wish to enjoy a movie with your family this is it. Go for it."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10534500/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," Felt so good, felt so close to Home! ","Powered by an outstanding Indrans, aided by his unassuming and innocent demeanour, the flick has been enormously successful in driving Home a lot of valuable life lessons in this modern, digital era. While the incidents in the flick are relatable and heartwarming, it also brings Home the ill effects of obsessive use of social media on one's personal as well as professional lives and perhaps it helps one make amends to this effect in the future.Spoilers alert:-The incidents in the flick are highly relatable. All of us must have surely helped an older person understand the nitty-gritty of using a smartphone. I could relate Oliver Twist immensely to my grandpa. He too at first, had the similar habit of jotting down the procedures of using different apps/ features on a smartphone. He used to test my patience and I regret the moments where I wished I could have spent a little more time explaining things to him, but I would, just in an uninterested way, explain quickly and would then just take off to my own digital world. But eventually, with a will to learn, he now knows how to use most of the apps/features and spends a major chunk of his time exploring the social media, much to our dismay.The well-executed flick is powered by a masterclass performance of Indrans. While his unassuming, innocent demeanor has surely helped, but to evoke emotions in the manner in which he was able to, it surely has to stand out as one of his best acts, if not the best. Others have chipped in too, but Oliver Twist is likely to stay etched on our minds for a long long time.The flick also does well to spread some much needed and relevant messages in this modern, digital world. While, we are all familiar about the good things of social media, the ill effects have been brought up in an effective, yet a light manner. How the overdependence on social media can affect one personally as well as professionally has been brought out well.Though it could be argued that there aren't any negative aspects about the flick, I, for one, felt the backstory was probably a little exaggerated. As Oliver Twist rightly said, it feels like all made up. The toxic relationship between Anthony and Priya too has not been dwelled upon, whereas, it has been adjudged to be quite normal.Still, #Home is one of the best Malayalam flicks to have hit the screens recently, more so because delightful feel-good flicks are hard to come by nowadays. Home stands well apart from the intense, complicated and disturbing flicks that we are so used to now in Malayalam. With a simple, uncomplicated plot, having no twists or turns, it manages to capture the attention of the viewers."

Some nicely creepy moments (despite the more than slightly done-to-death plotline), and the kid actor plays her part well.Unfortunately, she's in the minority; rarely have I seen such atrocious acting. From the pouting, barely intelligible female lead to the incongruously cockney priest, things go rapidly on a downward slope from early on, taking the whole thing from promisingly spooky into the realms of the ridiculous, not to mention predictable.If it had been slightly cringier it could almost have been a spoof, but sadly it stops short of that point, resulting in a flat, boring waste of time. Sorry."

Then there was the changes in Cora. But then the pace began to slow. Also the incident with the sleep professional who was monitoring Cora during the night did not make sense to the point that she was supposed to be awake but when the key incident happened with the swimming pool she fell asleep. The big issue with this is that you never saw her sleeping during the day, so how was she supposed to stay awake all night aswell.Only by about three quarters through the film as it began to metamorph itself into something like a low budget exorcist film did the pace quicken.I agree with others to the fact that the acting at times was abysmal as well as the direction of the film. For me the ending seemed a little rushed and needed a little more time. On a good note I would say the special effects were decent enough.On the whole I would say it was ok to watch but nothing to write home about."

I feel like it gave away a little bit too much and you will enjoy it more if you just go in and watch it.It is a interesting idea of a movie but still makes it feel like a classic horror movie that you want it to be. The acting is overall good and always keeps a very unsettling vibe. You always feel like there is something a little bit off even in the beginning when it is just normal life. You can tell that there is something that is a bit off.Another thing that I loved was the directing style especially in the beginning. It is something different that is not something that you are used to so it allows it to go along with the vibe of the movie that something is a little off without taking anything away from the movie.But I think at the end it becomes a little cheesy with the voice that the demon has and it doesn't make it seem real enough to scare as much as it could. I thought the creepiest parts of the ending were just when the kid was yelling for help because it seemed more human and relatable.But, I felt the ending was still very strong and it wasn't like your typical the exorcism saves the day and its all okay and it adds more to the and creates more urgency. I liked how it wasn't your typical ending and it actually had some new things and added more depth to the story."

This is not a multi-million blockbuster and there no sense to treat it as such. A mainstream movie with a classic plot. If you don't judge it by your high expectations but by what it really is supposed to be, you'll find it pretty fine."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10540510/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," transformative and innovative ","Flames, shadows, reflections on water at night, rock music, Japanese drums, stars, and more. The imagery, innovation, and imagination of Inu-Oh baffle and transform the mind.Based on real life ancient folk theater characters from the margins of society, a masked and deformed dancer (Inu-Oh) and blind biwa player (Tomona) combine to dispel a curse that hangs over them. Their popular performances tell the stories of ancient and forgotten Heike spirits. They are transformative and beautiful. Audiences are hypnotized, and so much so that their performances threaten the ruling elites. The power of stories, music, dance, and other arts takes on the powers that be, with explosive and transformative results.Inu-Oh is a creative, colorful, and constantly surprising reimagining of actual history. The rock music dance sequences are finely crafted and visionary. Unique and transformative, Inu-Oh is unlike anything I have seen.Seen at the Toronto international film festival."
