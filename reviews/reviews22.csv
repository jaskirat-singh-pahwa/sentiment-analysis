He's set to go to group home until foster parent Kristin (Sherri Shepherd) volunteers to take him in. Only he has to join her and her son George at a Christian camp run by David (David Koechner). Immediately, he falls for sweetie Avery (Bailee Madison).This Christian film is trying to be a Disney TV musical. It's not the worst idea but the first half is a dud. The lead kid is written as a prankster troublemaker but he's played like a lightweight. At most, he's lying to get the girl. He doesn't even try to run away as his first move. He's bland until the second half. Along with the movie in general, it gets better in the second half. The first half is a boring version of High School Musical. Will and Avery don't even get a good meet-cute. Their first meeting is a perfunctory love-at-first-sight moment which turns immediately to a big musical. It's a meet-perfunctory. It's not until 45 minutes when the couple has a good one-on-one heart-to-heart. From that moment on, the movie improves markedly. They even have their first good song by the campfire and they let their God flag fly. It's like the movie decides to land all the big punches at once. If Will is more of a brigand earlier, his character could have a bigger arc. If the Christianity gets let loose sooner, it could set up the internal religious conflict better. If Will and Avery have more moments quicker, they could have more punch in their emotional drama. Bailee Madison could eat up those Emmy moments if she's released. The first half is a missed opportunity."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11388278/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," a peacefilled chime... ","Towards the power and spirits of heaven up abovedly satisfaction, a drama like taken out of the holy scripts, happening on a youth summer camp out in the heavenly fields of akkenbom somewhere rural and desolate , near a lake as usual for summer camps in the usa, where everybody, even their opponents and competition of the socalled wargames of the summer camp are nice and cheerful against each other, and where the singalong songs comes everytime some of the main cast takes the high note, and everybody joins the chorusline, bouncing around like electrified newly saved souls of heavenly bliss high on coke(the drink) buzzing around like busy bees, a physical spirit that may asphycsiate a grumpy old man due to exhaustion.So a religious romantic drama it is , with captivating music and lyrics, and as mentioned extremely intens dancing and jubalong. The acting though is barely average, its more the whole concept of baptismic joy and the returning prodigal son coming home to ''his'' congregation instead of juvenile detention, spiced up with extremely good timing on the filmographic and musical score edition, and i clap my hand for the correographic work done , and a vividly visual and auditorial good product made.So this film will either entice you or not, good mood and no expectation is a good way to view a film like this, and even though the lack of story originality its well worth a try even christian or not. I'm just a grumpy old man that dont usually like musicals and religious loaded stuff, but this took me as a stormy gust on the ocean that pulled me well into the playtime before i even considered anything. So a feelgood story on a friday evening it is, even though the laws of coronabehaviour is totally forgotten here. So keep the kissing, hugging and handshakes at a mileage distance, and do not do the duetts face to face rather back to back... inhalationistic duets is the new trend my friend.So a facinating film for the whole family, enjoy..."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11388278/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," A Disney Channel Original Movie as a Netflix original you bet. ","A Week Away is Netflix's latest movie starring Bailey Madison and Kevin Quinn. Directed by Roman White this teen musical tells the tale of a foster teen named Will Hawkins(Quinn) who is send to a music camp from his case advisor and befriends George(Jupin Cook I think his name is). Will pretends to be George's cousin as he is ashamed of being known as a foster trouble teen. However Will meets Avery(Madison) and romance blossoms. Will he tell Avery the truth about his real identity.Overall if your a fan of Camp Rock and High School Musical mixing in Christianity then you'd probably enjoy it. For me I thought it wasnt too bad. The songs were forgettable and the film wasn't original as mentioned it was trying to pass itself off as a DCOM from the Disney Channel(now part of Disney +)."

Why? Why?! Don't watch this."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11388278/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," Faith and fun for Christian audiences ","IN A NUTSHELL: If you've been in the mood for another fun high school musical but with a Christian slant, here you go! This sweet musical blends faith, friendship, and fun that Christian audiences will enjoy. Non-Christian families can also feel safe watching it with their kids and point out some positive lessons learned while tapping their toes to easy-breezy music and dancing. The cast looks like they had a complete blast making this family-friendly film that features reimagined music by Amy Grant, Michael W. Smith, and For King & Country.This is the summary by Netflix: Nowhere left to go, Will Hawkins finds himself at a summer camp for the first time. His instinct is to run, but he finds a friend, a father figure, and even a girl who awakens his heart. Most of all, he finally finds a home.THINGS I LIKED: Christian movies are kind of famous for being super cheesy and not very good, but I thought they did a pretty good job on this film overall!Kevin Quinn is the leading man and a Zac Efron in the making. He has a lot of chemistry and star potential.I had seen Bailee Madison in some of her previous movies but never knew she could sing!There's a cute intro during the opening credits.The heartfelt movie takes place in Nashville, Tennessee, appropriate when you consider all of the musical talents in that city.Comedienne Sherri Shepherd is all smiles and a fun addition to the film.Lots of good choreography to songs that are catchy and will make you want to sing or dance along.I love it when movies reference other movies. There's a cute John Hughes movie montage. Other movie mentions include Mr. And Mrs. Smith and Ferris Bueller's Day Off and Apocalypse Now movies.Keep watching during the final credits for some more entertaining clips.Fans of Amy Grant will be thrilled to see her make a quick cameo performance.As a Christian-based movie, it doesn't beat you over the head with preaching. In fact, it mostly tucks its Christian doctrine into songs, rather than have characters spend a lot of time talking.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE: Admittedly, the script is super cheesy with a story we've seen done before many times.Most of the kids look a LOT older than high school kids.One of the characters had an instantaneous transformation that should have taken a lot longer, especially considering his past.There are a few lip-sync moments that didn't work very well.It definitely doesn't take a hard nose-dive into doctrine, but skirts around tough issues with a softer, gentler approach to the idea of love and God.The film won't make any new converts but will be a breath of fresh air for its Christian audience.TIPS FOR PARENTS: The movie is very family-friendly with no profanity or objectionable content.Some bullyingTHEMES: Community Friendship Forgiveness Second Chances Religion - ChristianityYou can see the rest of my review on my Movie Review Mom YouTube channel."

A dramatic musical film for Christian teens.It is about a rebellious boy who has the option of going to a camp or ending up in the reformatory.Quality.The songs although generic some others are interesting.Not all performances are at the level.At times the story can feel a bit lazy and meaningless, it falls into all the hackneyed camp movie stuff as well as teenage characters. You can even feel a romantic comedy.The message he gives is clear: be yourself and give love. It is the basis of the film, in the end without love the world cannot.About opportunities in life and trusting God.It raises interesting questions about God and life, but many of them are not fully answered.If you ever went to a religious camp, this movie will make you feel identified.Sunday."

Even the lady that loves musicals wanted to change to a different movie because there was too much singing and dancing. Every time they start speaking it leads to singing & dancing with large groups of dance choreography."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11388278/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt"," I'm Surprised That Christians Loved It ","This movie is all about good vibes, having a great time, embracing God's grace: So that I AM happy. And for me, that's the biggest problem I have with this flick.If you call yourself a Christian you should know what the Bible says about hedonism. And "A Week Away" is full of hedonists - people that only aim for pleasure and fun, nothing else matters, God loves me just as I am - I don't have to change, everything will be fine.Well, it's not. If we don't repent from the inside out, if we don't get that the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, we won't be free from our negative habits. Fear of the Lord means hating the evil. But we don't do that - we just live our lives, we don't really care about God and his word, but when our feelings are hurt, we praise His grace. Well, keep going - you won't find what you're looking for.God is so good and he has so much to offer for us - if we finally understand what following Jesus is all about!Sorry for this little sermon, but it bugged me that the movie had a chance to preach the gospel to Netflix' subscribers but failed to do so. It preaches prosperity theology.I still gave it 5 stars as I enjoyed the acting, singing and the harmless vibe."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11388278/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","3"," A forgettable and preachy musical. ","It was kind of a cute musical. But like any musical the thing that makes or breaks it for me is the soundtrack. This one was very forgettable and dull. There was a couple songs that were decent but nothing i would listen to outside of the movie. The acting was also just ok and everything was predictable and the religion aspect was very forced. Not horrible but nothing i would watch again."

It was ok, I've seen much worse, but it was a bit boring and I found myself skipping the songs as there were so many. We've seen this kind of storyline before where there's a young boy who is getting into trouble and he'll fall in love and change his bad attitude. I had trouble believing that this boy was ever really bad as he seems to adjust straight away in the camp and doesn't really seem to have much of a bad attitude to me. I'd definitely recommend this movie if you want something easy to watch. I'm glad I watched it, but I won't be watching it again."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11388278/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," Nevermind the ratings! ","Ratings for this movie are just so unfair. Never give a rating if this kind of movie doesn't fit your genre. This one's a gem if your'e looking for a movie centering on Christian Praise Songs. The storyline is quite simple probably because this one doesn't need to be too serious. Come on, don't mind the red rating. Give this movie a shot!"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11388278/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Sweet but... ","It's a nice, sweet movie but they ruined it by making it a musical. It's fine when a song is in the background over an action scene or when it's the talent show and they're supposed to be singing, but just breaking into a song and dance number in the middle of a conversation is weird and only works on rare occasions (e.g., Grease, West Side Story, The Sound of Music).Also, casting directors need to cast teen actors as teen characters. Viewers can tell the difference between 17-year-olds and guys in their mid 20s."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11388278/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," Kinda enjoyable ","Let's start with the good points or point... I think the songs are very good done. The actors are better in singing than acting, obviously. The acting made me feel uncomfortable. Especially from the Kevin Quinn to be honest and that is a problem. I really like him as an musician and actor, but this movie doesn't fit him well. Oh, and the story is just a no. I thought, finally a Christian musical, but the Christian camp setting felt without a reason... I don't know, I didn't feel like I was watching a movie about christians. It could just be a random camp. It was just a weird movie."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11388278/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," It was predictable. ","It's a Christian musical movie. I adore musical movies so I decided to watch it even I knew it's gonna be boring with not so wow songs. The first I love about musicals is the songs. But this one has not so good songs, it's a little be boring. I think thaht I'm too old ( 18) for this movie. I would suggest that for children 10-16 years old."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11388278/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Preaching to the choir ","First of all, this is a great movie for everyone, not just Christians. Many movies these days sacrifice good storytelling in favor of promoting and agenda, an evil one by the way. This one instead sacrifices good storytelling in favor of promoting a positive agenda on which most of us can agree on.The problem is, you don't need Christianity to promote good values. The story doesn't just take place in a Christian camp, the movie itself takes a stance for it and that's a major no-go for me in terms of storytelling. It takes the short path by choosing the simplistic approach of selling Christianity to the Christians.A movie can be about a serial killer without promoting homicide, and this one could feature a troubled boy redeeming himself and giving a new course to his life after his week at a Christian camp that is an element of the fiction and not the "official" stance. By doing this, the movie limits its target audience to a very niche sector and lots of people will be turned off by the "Christian movie" label and miss out on a great musical."

They kinda remade it in a Christian Camp Rock context just to shake things up. The protagonist acting is like a copy of Zac Efron's Troy, the resemblance is amazing actually. The songs are not that catchy but they are all fun and the acting from the main girl is pretty good. I do think that some things felt way too rushed tho (especially at the beginning and at the climax, which are some of the most important parts of any movie).It won't go down in history as a teen musical classic but I would still recommend it if you just want to appreciate some cliche cute story with a couple of good songs!"

The plot and storyline are straightforward but sometimes confusing. Confusing also as they cannot anticipate the magnitudes of their increasingly brutal actions. They are a bit stupid. The crime family is headed in her absence by nephew Dallas (Frank Grillo) and her son Wyatt (Josh Hartnett), who make their living holding up trucks on remote highways. "Ida Red" explains crime as a genetic issue. The problem with this family is that they are not really smart and actually quite bad at crime. Movie is fast paced with great action scenes. Great acting by Frank Grillo (Dallas) and Melissa Leo (Ida Red Walker). If you have the time and like these kind of heist movies, just watch.

But without all the profanity, over-acting, and senseless, overworked drivel that passes for "drama" and 'effect". Bleak and violent as this is at times, that is not the feeling it ultimately leaves you with. The music is utterly perfect, the acting is seamless, and the dialog and direction just work together like a well-oiled machine from beginning to end. It's damn fine film making that MANY other new directors(and even some older ones) could, and SHOULD take SERIOUS notes from. Can't put too fine a point on this except to say; "Damn, that was really good.""

It takes 36 minutes of absolute boredom before we discover what happened and even then it is just snippets. As it turns out Hayden was responsible for a school shooting which killed 10 kids (and then himself). These are the parents of one of the children looking for answers.The film only touches on politics, gun control, and violent video games. It is a drama about a child feeling isolated and mental illness. I will say it was well acted, however I found the topic boring. What was with the camera panning outside all the time? Was that a see I am clever, I can make the audience feel isolated?Guide: F-word."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11389748/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," both sides of the table ","Greetings again from the darkness. A normal life is no longer possible. The question becomes, how does one go on in the aftermath of an unimaginable (yet all too common) tragedy that takes the life of one's child? This the feature film debut of writer-director Fran Kranz. He's an actor you'd likely recognize from JUNGLELAND and THE CABIN IN THE WOODS. Rather than choose some lightweight project to kick off his filmmaking career, Franz serves up a gut-wrenching confrontation that would work just as well (if not even better) on stage in live theater.It's an awkward and maladroit opening as two church volunteers (Breeda Wool and Kagen Albright) and another woman (Michelle N Carter, who's either an attorney or a therapist), are preparing an isolated room for what is clearly a high-stakes meeting. The room will have a table and four chairs, and enough refreshments for 20 people. Almost the entire movie will take place in this room, around that table and away from the church choir practice.The four anticipated guests arrive, and it's two couples - four people uneasy and unsure about the meeting. After some initial small talk, we finally learn Evan, the son of Martha Plimpton and Jason Isaacs, was shot by Hayden, the son of Ann Dowd and Reed Birney. It's been six years since the Columbine-like school shooting and both couples are seeking closure to the immense grief they've carried. There is also the overwhelming burden of guilt and the weight of blame.These are four recognizable and accomplished actors working in ways we typically only see on stage. The always superb Ms. Dowd ("The Handmaid's Tale") and the often villainous, yet always effective, Mr. Isaacs ("The OA") are truly at the top of their game, which is to take nothing away from the performances of Mr. Birney ("House of Cards") and Ms. Plimpton (Keith Carradine's daughter, and from a child actor in THE GOONIES to a series lead in "Raising Hope"). Their interactions mostly feel grounded in emotions, and we as viewers find ourselves dragged right into their personal misery.A flower arrangement, a box of Kleenex, bagels, piano music, and a Christmas photo all play a role, but this is an actor's showcase, and director Kranz gives each their time in the spotlight. These are four people who consider themselves good parents, and one has the fortitude to say it aloud, "I raised a murderer." This is couples therapy re-imagined, and it's a necessary but painful step for four people who have endured more than any parent should endure. Both sides of the table highlight our worst fears as parents, but equally as important, is the need for forgiveness - of others and ourselves. This one will likely stick with you for a while.Bleecker Street will release MASS in theaters on October 8th, 2021."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11389748/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," A breathtaking debut feature ","Fran Kranz's 'Mass' is a breathtaking debut feature about grieving parents that will linger long after the movie is over. The four-person ensemble group delivers fascinating performances while conveying a nail-biting story. Honest, optimistic, and brave, it is profoundly compelling in both the intimacy of its dramatic scope and the universality of the subjects it addresses."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11389748/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," Sundance 2021: Mass is one of the most emotionally challenging films I've ever seen. It's impossible to feel indifferent about it. ","If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)I don't know why now, but I didn't watch Mass as a premiere during Sundance. Instead, I left it to an on-demand viewing for the next day. As soon as I finished Wild Indian (which I sort of liked), I knew I made a mistake. Mass is one of the heaviest, unbreathable, overwhelmingly emotional films I've ever seen. This review was supposed to have been up 24h ago, but I needed to process everything and sleep on it. It's even more shocking considering this is a feature directorial debut for Fran Kranz, who becomes a filmmaker worthy of all my attention from now on.His impressive direction takes the viewers through a story told in such a raw, authentic way that even a simple room with chairs and a table is enough to hold the audience at the edge of their seats for the entire runtime. Technically, I must praise Kranz's mise-en-scne, which tells a story on its own through the movement of the actors and the position of certain set elements during each scene. From something seemingly irrelevant as the carefully placed flowers and tissues to the extremely tense atmosphere created by the parents' uncomfortable disposition, I finished the movie emotionally exhausted as if someone had drained everything inside me.This takes me to one of the most compelling, devastating, heartfelt performances I've ever seen in a single film. Every actor incorporates their respective characters in such a giving, passionate manner that I'm sure this movie was as hard to shoot for them as it was for the viewers to watch. Jason Isaacs, Ann Dowd, Martha Plimpton, and Reed Birney all deserve nominations in every awards show worldwide. I can't even pick a standout interpretation because all are genuinely magnificent. They're all so extraordinarily invested in dealing with their characters' struggles that I couldn't stop tearing up after each line of dialogue. Everyone has at least one big moment to shine, and everyone nails that moment in a jaw-dropping way.However, Mass is far from being an actor showcase. It brings several sensitive, important matters to the table (literally), such as gun violence and the impact of video games on young people, but it also addresses feelings that are tough to deal with: forgiveness, love, the ability to move on, grief/loss, anger, guilt, depression, and so much more. It's one of those films that will undoubtedly impact every single viewer, even if it's in a negative way. As much as I love everything I saw on the screen, it's also a movie I don't see myself watching again, at least not more than two times. It ends in an expectedly positive light, but it might be too emotionally demanding for me in this current phase of my life.Mass is undoubtedly one of the most emotionally challenging viewings I've ever had to face. Fran Kranz's feature directorial debut tells an unbelievably heavy story through four actors who dive deep into their characters, all delivering career-best performances. Everyone is an incredible standout: Jason Isaacs, Ann Dowd, Martha Plimpton, and Reed Birney deserve a massive campaign to receive every acting award there is. The cast drains every single ounce of emotion within the viewers, transforming a tiny little room with impactful mise-en-scne that tells its own story into an extremely tense, heart-wrenching, almost unbreathable environment. Dozens of meaningful matters and challenging feelings are addressed in the span of little less than two hours, creating a truly devastating film that left me sobbing. It's utterly impossible for someone not to be affected by this movie, even if it's in a negative way. It's one of those films that I'll recommend to everyone and support throughout its eventual release, but I can't deny this might have been my one and only watch of such a brutally demanding, authentic story.Rating: A"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11389748/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," Pure heartbreak with out of this world-performances ","Fran Kranz, previously known mainly as an actor, tells an original story in his directorial debut Mass, which could seem like an adapted play to many. Six years after a devastating tragedy, the parents of two victims gather in the room of a church to come to terms with the events of that time together. This results in a real emotional chaos between four protagonists, peppered with grief, pain, anger and pure fear.I have often heard that Mass is a quiet film. Yes, it's not a sci-fi blockbuster with countless scenarios, dispenses entirely with any effects and has only four central characters. In that respect, it is definitely a quiet film. But if you define calm by emotional connection, then Mass is probably the spectacle of the year. For what is rehashed and thematised here rips your heart out. Rarely have I shed so many tears at a film. Rarely have all the protagonists grown so close to my heart despite their different behaviours. Never have dialogues and monologues been so close to my heart. This is largely due to Franz's borderline brilliant screenplay. But in this film it is the actors who make the difference. I have rarely come across such a top-class performance from an ensemble. All four get moments to shine and do so with incredible bravura. I'll start with Jason Isaacs, probably the most recognisable name among the four. His character Jay still can't believe the incident and death of his son. He tries to understand the psyche of the perpetrator, who turns out to be the son of the other parents. Although he tries not to ask too much of them at first, he becomes more and more impatient and angry as time goes on. This leads to a scene where Jay snaps and takes the conversation in a completely different direction. From this point on he is an emotional wreck. You buy both emotional states from Isaacs through his facial expressions alone. Let's move on to the two mothers, Gale (Martha Plimpton) and Linda (Ann Dowd). The former is unexpectedly restrained until the last act, before letting her baggage run free at the end. And in a way that is simply unfathomable. Plimpton's chemistry with Isaacs is insanely authentic and if you said they'd been through this thing in real life, I'd believe it. Ann Dowd is much more eloquent in her role and always tries to be the emotional constant through subtlety. Until a final monologue that must win Dowd the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress. Even though she and Plimpton give each other nothing here. If only there were Reed Birney as the no-nonsense and proud businessman Richard. He talks a lot but never really gets too specific. He is emotionally stiff. Although he visibly wants to open up more, he can't. This is frustrating to watch, but also couldn't be better portrayed. Birney also deserves all the praise in the world for his less emotional but efficient performance.So yes, Mass is an acting masterpiece. One that I have rarely seen in this form and oe that will stay with me for a very long time. It tells a tragic story in such a realistic manner that you almost believe you are really standing in the room listening to the four people on the spot. Dialogue has rarely been so tangible and distant for someone who, thank God, has never had to go through something like this. But at the same time, it's a film I probably won't be able to watch again because of the sheer harshness of its subject matter. Moreover, certain visual cuts are unnecessary. But no one cares about that."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11389748/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," A Masterclass in acting! ","This would make a fantastic theatre play, as its exactly that. Sure, some people might say "why should I watch 4 people sit and talk in a room for 2 hours?" ...but this is so much more than this. I think I have found my surprise/underdog Oscar nominee here.I would even recommend to NOT watch the trailer and experience that journey like it was meat to be watched. You slowly get clues fed and construct what really happened. The movie completely relies on the reverse principle of film making and goes for the "Tell dont show" in this case, which does work though!Especially Martha Plimpton and Ann Dowd are NAILING it in this movie. This could very well been have a Masterclass session by those two on how to act in a drama.There is no visual stimulation, but this movie still manages to take you onto an emotional journey and when you think its over....it isnt.In all honesty, this is not a movie that needs to be seen in the cinema, this is actually perfect for a streaming service. Just give this movie a chance and fully focus on how brilliant those 4 actors are!"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11389748/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," An Outstanding Portrait of Devastation ","Mass tells a heart-breaking story in a way that feels unique in its own way with using interesting editing and dialogue choices that all in all makes it purposeful to see the experience writer/director Fran Kranz has crafted. Performance wise it is filled with considerate actors and actresses that need a lot of attention. And WTF the actresses from The Goonies and Parenthood is in this, and shes amazing. Like come on. If you get a chance to see it, don't waste it."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11389748/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," Acting masterclass!!! Brilliant ","If you like plays especially dramas that reveal the human condition you'll love this film. It is incredibly written and directed and all 4 actors are outstanding. Ann Dowd was amazing and she deserves many accolades, it's hard because I've never seen 4 actors all so committed throughout an entire movie. No one missed a beat or dropped the ball, this was a painfully beautiful and amazingly acted film and I highly recommend it. The strongest performance (which is hard to say because all were so brilliant) but it was Martha Plimpton's character that made me sob uncontrollably. Her character slowly reveals throughout the film and it's not until the end that the character truly comes through and it is so well earned and I just couldn't stop crying with her pain and truth and honest emotion. Martha Plimpton hands down deserves an Oscar for this role, this performance is stronger than many past winners. I've never seen acting this good in a film and I've actually never said that before. I hope the politics of the Academy doesn't deny this performance what it deserves and that is an Academy Award."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11389748/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," Riveting ","Excellent pacing for a difficult subject. While all the acting is very good, I saw it as a story of two mothers trying to cope. I expect Ann Dowd and possibly Martha Plympton to get nominated for acting awards."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11389748/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," A realistic take with equal importance weighed among the characters ","A couple grieved with the death of their son arrange a meeting to meet face to face with the parents of the son that killed their son. The film is mainly centered around a conversation between the couples confined in a room. Heavy elements of morality, fault, and human condition are brought to the table in "Mass."This film's magic comes from its writing and its powerhouse actors. Even though the conversation is confined to a single room in real time, the audience will not drown into boredom. Each shot and cinematography choice is unique, made in careful consideration to the tone and where the conversation goes. The same goes for choice of sound and score, which are sparingly used in the film, only when necessary.Also, Kanz was able to capture sense and nuance of awkwardness in certain scenes of the film that I felt I have experienced some points my in life. This is especially prevalent in the two church volunteers and the woman from an outside organization that arranged the meeting.This movie may not be for everyone, while it may cost an effort to really listen in and analyze what each of the characters discuss, but it's rewarding to see where this conversation evolves to at the end. Kudos for Kanz on this fantastic directorial debut and a bravado performance by all of the four centered characters. I've never heard so many people tear up and sniffle in a theater.Also, Martha Plimpton gave a wonderful, ebullient answers in her post-film question panel after the screening at the Virginia Film Festival. She was such a sweetheart."

","If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)It's definitely my fault, but my Sundance schedule so far can mostly be characterized by incredibly ambiguous endings, extremely layered narratives, and emotionally heavy stories that left me utterly exhausted by the end of the day. After an overwhelming, devastating viewing of Mass, I seriously needed something to boost my spirit and recharge my energy for the rest of the day. Therefore, I'm super delighted that Marvelous and the Black Hole is such a wonderfully light, funny, uplifting film.Miya Cech (Sammy) and Rhea Perlman (Margot) offer two heartfelt, amusing performances by portraying captivating characters who have more things in common than they imagine. With a beautifully written, nuanced screenplay and terrific direction, Kate Tsang delivers a lovely story about sensitive matters such as grief, anger, and the whole "moving on" theme, but also about following your passion without holding anything back. It was with genuine pleasure and joy that I closely followed the young protagonist throughout the entire runtime without looking away from the screen.My biggest compliment has to go to Tsang's writing. I can count so many apparently irrelevant little details that later pay off in such an emotionally resonant manner. I dropped a couple of tears in the last few minutes when Sammy gets to prove her worth, and part of that is also due to Miya's display, an astonishing surprise for me. In addition to this, I love the little sketches spread across the movie, like the screen was Sammy's notebook, demonstrating what she's feeling in the moment. An innovative, entertaining way of developing a character further.Marvelous and the Black Hole is a massive surprise, being one of my absolute favorites from Sundance so far. Kate Tsang's feature directorial debut is a huge success that definitely places her as a filmmaker to pay close attention to in the following years. With a remarkably subtle, detailed screenplay, Miya Cech and Rhea Perlman spread their sparkling chemistry across the screen, delivering two of the most entertaining performances I've seen in the last few days. A heartwarming story that begins with the impact of the loss of a mother and finishes with an emotionally powerful, uplifting, magic(al) show that I'll remember for quite a while. The young protagonist is so relatable that I couldn't help but drop a couple of tears by the end.Rating: A-"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11389868/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Very Cute ","Marvelous and the Black Hole is adorable. A teenage delinquent teams up with a surly children's party magician to navigate her dysfunctional family and inner demons. Miya Cech and Rhea Perlman make a great duo. The story is very simple and easy to follow. This is a casual watch that young teens will fall for. The focus on the childlike nature is good and works well for the story. Sometimes it felt a little too childish, especially towards the end when it deals with heavier subjects. The tone could've been worked out a bit better, but it's still fun. This feels like something that will go to Netflix for people of all ages to enjoy."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11390180/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Not bad, but need better attention to detail ","I liked the story, overall and the movie isn't bad so 6.4/10 from me. However, here are the issues that just made it worse than it could've been.1. Bad attention to detail. From bad deep-fakes to background CGI SFX that were too obvious. Some extras wren't very good too.2. Graphic that looked like out of a computer game from 2010. It all looked very cartoonish. Too cartoonish 3. Storyline didn't always connect so if you don't know the original story, it can be hard to follow. Had to explain to people with me what is happening and why. It almost like they really wanted to make it as short as possible so they cut out the important peaces 4. Subpar "camera work" @ CGI. Eg. Some scenes are slow motion(again not fast but slow) and what seems like 15 fps. All you see is a blur up until the motion of the camera stops. That's just horrible and headache inducing way to film. Viewers want to see the details and not a blur.5. They could've put a bit more humor. Too many times I was watching and said to myself, "would've been funnier if they did...".6. A tiny fraction of points were also taken due to a presence of a specific actor who not long ago did something really bad and didn't man up to the consequences; and any time I see him, I don't get a good feeling any more. I don't get any positive feelings when I see his face... Using this actor by anyone these days is quite stupid. Sure, some love him, but some don't and you are alienating half of the people who may not even see a movie because he is part of the script. Something to think about...Anyways. A good movie overall."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11390180/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," Lame, amateurish, but not exactly bad ","Not really bad, but feels very amateur. Low-budget.There's a lot to blame the movie for. Screenplay, CGI, make up and costumes, some cringey dialogues, actors overacting here and there... But the biggest problem overall is that it looks more like a cheap TV-film, not a cinema-level thing.On the other hand, there are good points, too. You can't really believe into Kings and Peasants here, but actors truly make you believe their characters' feelings now and again. The writing maybe not too coherent, but some story arcs are just wonderful! They may have severely shortened the original story making it a third of what there were, they may have also changed a lot in characters' development, but in the end they still delivered a nice magical fairy-tale based upon the classics of Russian children's literature.I can't really recommend this as a movie, I'm afraid. Definitely not the best of Russian cinema! It can't even surpass the cartoon of 1975, by far. Still, if you have a spare evening, you may give it a try."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11390656/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," Heaven or hell - we are lost ","So this is quite nonsensical ... just to get that off to the start it needs and to be honest the only thing you really need to know. It is quite the low brow humor if you want to call it that. Advicing anyone to watch ... well it really depends on what you find funny or not. I liked the cast overall and they did their best with what was on hand.That being said, this really is not ... well it may be more of a family comedy than anything else. Viewed as such might help to enjoy this. And knowing the actors/comedians involved is also a bonus for sure. It is the likeability of those that made this bearable for me. But comedy is really a matter of taste and maybe you are able to laugh at some or most the silliness. Good for you if that is the case ... so watch at least part of the trailer to see if you are up for it/in the mood ... then decide. Because story wise there really isn't much to it (predictable too)"

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11392272/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," A rather generic foray into the woods... ","When I sat down to watch this 2021 thriller/horror movie titled "The Retreat" from writer Alyson Richards and director Pat Mills, I must admit that my expectations weren't all that high, as the movie had managed to acquire a rating of 3.6 stars here on IMDb.But still, it being a movie that I hadn't already seen, of course I managed to find the time to watch it.And sure, "The Retreat" was a watchable movie, albeit a very mundane and generic one at that, especially for a movie such as this, set in the trapped in the wilderness and stalked by killers genre. If there is such a thing.The storyline was pretty straight forward, but it suffered heavily from being rather generic and predictable. Sure, it was watchable and entertaining enough, but the storyline does leave lots to be wanted. The movie had potential to be much more than what director Pat Mills managed to make it into.The acting in the movie was adequate. Now, a movie such as "The Retreat" is not the type of movie heavily reliant on Shakespearian performances, so don't consider yourself in for some mind-blowing and amazing acting performances here. Sure, I will say that the acting was okay for the movie, but that was about it.The overall feel to the movie was just bland. Writer Alyson Richards didn't bring anything new to the genre, and just played it safe by following a strict 'how-to-make-a-trapped-in-the-wilderness-stalked-by-killers' blueprint. So everything you see in "The Retreat" is something that has been done and seen countless times before in other movies of the same type, and more often done better than what was done here in "The Retreat".The movie was just rather devoid of ghastly things to keep the motivation going. I mean, there just was limited amounts of gore and violence in the movie, something which could have helped promote the overall enjoyment of "The Retreat" somewhat.It felt a little bit too scripted and too much of an easy ride for the two main characters in the movie as they went through what was supposed to be a harrowing ordeal of being trapped in the wilderness and stalked by killers. They just seemed to stroll through the events a bit too easily. And that made for a rather mundane movie experience, because it was lacking that element of terror, dread, hardship and actually being at risk.While I managed to sit through the entire movie, I must say that "The Retreat" was actually better than I had anticipated. But don't get me wrong here, because I am not saying that "The Retreat" was an outstanding movie experience. Hardly so. Nay, "The Retreat" was watchable, yes, but it was just too bland and generic actually.My rating of "The Retreat" lands on a very mediocre five out of ten stars."

The murderous homophobic rednecks are killing the same sex couple guests in camo and skull mask while they're staying at the retreat in the middle of nowhere. The woods looked so good during the fall season with leaves in all shades of yellow and red. Most of the kills were off camera but the redneck woman got her head smashed with the computer and another man got killed really brutally on camera. Val shot the last man and they streamed his death live as they did to all these people. Then some locals took them to the hospital.It doesn't offer anything literally anything different but towards the end it became a bit more paced, gory and interesting."

My only gripe is we now seem to be in a PC age where the victims never let loose giving pain to the baddies, they very often are dispatched painlessly and quick ( I want revenge to be seen ) IE the remake of I Spit on your grave, and similar.

It's not anything we haven't seen before but it was executed properly, what do you want more from this sub-genre?Protagonists are very likable, especially Renee. Humor is present occasionally but isn't forced. I wish it had the same directorial angle as in the second half of the movie because the first half is kinda messy.One of the negatives is that it's way too dark during some scenes in first half of the film, I watched it on highest resolution in complete darkness and still couldn't see what was going on.Soundtrack is good, it adds to some already good scenes. Pace is tailored for its duration. Granted, characters haven't always made the smartest decisions (during the first half) but then again it's a slasher.The ending was super enjoyable and gave me chills. 6/10."

But I love weird and surreal movies that isn't obvious in any way. I hate being spoon fed what a movie is about (which is probably why I hate new and modern films). I like there to be shrouded parts you really have to think about, and movies you might have to see more than one or two times to get the full picture. Strawberry Mansion is just like that!It's obvious it is on an bit of a budget, but I think that only adds to the charm. The length was good, but maybe they could've tightened the entire thing up a little bit.To me it is a good sign when the reviews of a movie is either from people who loved it or from people who hated it, and almost no one that was just "Eh...".

This is essentially the films' best quality, as the style of interviewing the various figures associated with the mystery serves the film nicely. Since the first half revolves rather nicely around the slow-building layout of the disappearance by giving an idea of who the guy was and where the investigation into their lives will go. Seeing their brotherly relationship, the idea of what's going on at the house, and the little things happening around him that are setting up the potential to come later on when everyone keeps making strange notices about his behavior all manage to provide a genuinely creepy and eerie setup from this found-footage approach. The second half, where the more found-footage style incorporated by the home videos offers a lot to enjoy about it. The creepiness of the encounters, from seeing the same scarf all over the woods and spotting the lanterns laid out like a graveyard to scenes of the two going through a previously inaccessible room to find scores of creepy dolls and a mysterious tape inside. These take full advantage of the generally chilling use of found-footage as the early setup of his situation places all of his encounters and confrontations that provide this with some great encounters that pick up the intensity pretty nicely. For the most part, these aspects are what hold this up overall as there are some slight flaws to be had with this one. The main issue is the seemingly back-loaded amount of action that tends to place all the supernatural entities and appearances until then where the front section is much more scenario-building. While these are all required to give this a generally creepy air and mystery overall, having the film structured to featuring the more frenzied activity at the end might make the first seem a bit plodding and dull for some. As well, there is a bit of a meandering feel with the finale which ends the film at a great point and then keeps going on which is a bit of an underwhelming feature that might end this on a sour note. However, none of these are really detrimental and don't hold it back that much.Rated Unrated/R: Graphic Language and Violence."

I had no problems with the acting (I thought the characters were convincing, if at times a tiny bit contrived), plot or music (as was suggested by some critics) and I think overall it was very well done considering (I imagine) a fairly small budget.

Like others pointed out, acting is really bad. For what was supposed to be an upsetting or a serious scene, I laughed because of how bad acting was. With that said, this movie could have done so much better if they used better actors and also built characters and audience's attachment to the little girl. Instead, they killed her right away. They should have built the story up more to allow for more emotional investment in the girl and the father before killing her. They also should have filmed a much more emotional scene over her death. But, then again, with bad acting, it would have been a total disaster, so maybe they couldn't... Anyhow, if done right, this movie could have been actually good."

Daniel and Michael Muscal without ever having heard about the movie. But I must say that the movie's cover/poster seemed interesting, and of course the fact that the the movie was a horror movie that I hadn't already seen made me want to watch it as well.Well, I gave it a shot, and made it about halfway through, then I just gave up out of sheer and utter boredom. Man, this movie was a swing and a miss from director Larry Wade Carrell. It felt like an art project gone wrong, and as if you were tripping on a bad batch of mushrooms while watching it.The storyline told in "Girl Next" certainly had pontential, I will say that much, but it quickly fell to the ground and never recovered, as writers Zeph E. Daniel and Michael Muscal took the story into some kind of psychadelic rollercoaster ride.The acting in the movie was actually fair enough, despite the fact that the actors and actresses virtually had nothing solid or wholehearted to work with. Marcus Jean Pirae (playing Heinrich) and Paula Marcenaro Solinger (playing Misha) carried the movie well enough with their performances."Girl Next" fell short of providing me with much of any enjoyment or entertainment. And I wasn't fan of that whole pseudo-drug vision that the movie had going on.My rating of "Girl Next" lands on a mere three out of ten stars."

I have never seen such an inflated score on IMDb. 6.2??? There is no way. Funny how those reviewers have all joined the site in the last couple weeks or so. This is absolute trash in every way. Not entertaining trash--boring, overlong, and poorly done. From the first shots, I knew something was off because of how cheap looking it was. I stuck with it because I thought a movie rated this high must have a good story making up for the low budget limitations. After all, the average horror movie doesn't get that kind of score. None of the positives that have been ascribed by these reviewers are remotely true: it does not have a sense of realism, it is not comparable to any of the well-made, well-regarded films they mention, it will not change anything in horror moviemaking, and it does not have a message worth discussing. On top of all that, you get THE WORST acting performance since Deborah Reed in Troll 2--no exaggeration. The actress playing Charlotte does the worst grown-woman-trying-to-do-little girl-mannerisms, complete with inept speech impediment, then jumps to an amateur British accent for the final act. I've watched some crap in my time, but at least I knew it going in. That said, I wouldn't tell horror fans to skip it completely--just know that it is weak on story and never rises above the average bargain-bin toss off."

","This is very far from being a masterpiece, but I will still recommend it so let me explain why.Let us start with the bad. The directing here is pretty bad, the story is pretty good but executed upon poorly and the writing that could have elevated the story is severely lacking. Music is horrible. Camera work is abysmal.The acting is half and half. Half of the actors are great half the time, the other half suck half the time, mostly it is just meh.So why am I giving this a 6/10 and why am I still recommending it?Well the movie itself has a decent core story, albeit the script is not doing the story justice. But if you only look at the overarching story by itself, and especially the post credit scene (yes! Don't miss it!) this is pretty great. Also we get a trans woman as a main evil antagonist, I thought that was illegal?Lacey Cofran is excellent in the protagonist role, although as with the rest; the script and directing is ruining performance. She is also gorgeous and I believe she might get more (and better) roles in the future.I actually think there is a good movie here, hidden among all the trashy over the top dialogue and weird directorial work and horrible script. All the actors, with perhaps one exception, are excellent and do a great job with absolutely nothing to work with. With a great director, a bit more budget, and writers that can actually write I think this could have been an excellent horror movie.In reality this is probably 3/10, but I give the movie a few extra points due to what I mention above. I sort of recommend, but if so you cannot miss the post credit scene."

The scarey and nasty parts tell part of the story. I like that kind of horror but this isnt a horror film. Nah man this movie had substance and its deeply dense, filled with topics we hear about, but rarely see it all in one movie. This is some heavy s#@t so if your a delicate wimp go watch 'Justice league'. This movie 'Girl Next' is the real deal of being "new" in the same way George Romero films made a change in the movies back in the day, or how Christopher Nolan brings in sci fi supernatural like stuff to the movies. This movie has just the right amount of super natural, Darpa like intellectuals spying on druggie intellectuals, lots of that Mk ultra stuff, people morphing or not being who you think they are to keep me watching. That part where the gorgeous dark haired actreess reveals herself rattled my masculinity and I had to look up the actress to make sure she is what I was attracted to. Im ok, its only a movie and I like being rattled and shaken by a movie.Who ever directed this movie did a really good job of creating a semi-dream like experiance that sucked me into this F'd up world. I loved the challange. Who ever wrote the script for the the Charlotte character created one of the most messed up individuals since Deniro played Travis Bickle. The words that flew out of that girls mouth was shocking and true. The scene where they are eating dinner was worth the whole movie. I'm going to look up these actors, director and screenwriter.

No.Charlot explains the whole story. Charlot was the one who invented the reprograming stuff they do. Charlot knows that the pretty blond girl they just kidnapped is a fake, a clone who cant be programed and was put into this situation to spy on the nazi scientist.There are cameras everywhere and they are all being watched. The Charlot girl is the only one to know this spying is going on. This is only the first half and it gets weirder. I'm not going to spoil the second half. But keep your eye on the wife (woah that was shocking) and charlot.The scene with the hillbilly and the other sex scenes where not needed. I wanted to see more about the experiment happening to the sick scientist and who was really watching them and why.

Someone gave me 1 million dollars, but it wasn't worth sitting through this movie.I almost quit watching about an hour in. I wish I had, because there was another 42 minutes after that. This movie was a mess. This movie was boring. This movie was bad, but not in a "so bad it's good way". It was just bad. A truly horrific t0rture scene would have been if the bad guys tied up the woman and made her watch this movie."

Like, I Spit On Your Grave, Girl Next has the victim seek the ultimate revenge which is so satisfying to watch. Seeing this actress Lacey Cofran turn from a bland character into a dangerous lioness was talented acting, direction and writing all come together. I did have a problem with the fact that there was too much obvious make-up on a woman who is in the middle of rolling in the dirt and kicking ass, its not a time for a character to look pretty.Unlike I Spit On Your Grave, Girl Next was well made and more professional looking and sounding. If there where still Drive-ins I would watch this again at a Drive in."

Not necessarily sexually speaking, but just plain have affection for each other, embrace each other instead of hate each other just because we are differnt or want something (similar).But if that were the case you wouldn't have conflicts and some would say life would be boring. As is true for movies too of course. Imagine everyone hugging and kissing each other, instead of going at each others throats (literally and metaphorically speaking). Love can solve certain things, but also heighten others ... especially if it is considered "forbidden love" ... there is drama and fun here, but there is surprisingly enough also quite the amount of violence packed in here. I had no issues with it, but I imagine those only watching dramas may find it hard to stomach (no pun intended). Just be aware of it."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11428926/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Riccardo Scamarcio ","Netflix should be appreciated. They embraced a movie that is not for everyone. First of all, I think the movie got me in because I am Turkish. Because villagers, olives, agha order ... Everything is very familiar. Riccardo Scamarcio has done a great job. He believed in what he did. Deserves the award as a script or acting or producer. I wish I bought it even though it was Blu-ray edition."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11428926/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," Sunday movie ","An Italian drama based on real events. Not a love story completely takes a turn in the middle of the movie. It is about a married man whose mistress is the daughter of one of the lords of the town and the process of being discovered. Quality. The time spectacularly recreated. Good performances. Good effects on the few that are needed. He talks about the almost authoritarians of the people, the abuse of power, the repressed rebellions, the revenge. The only problem is that it has a good rhythm and after the middle it plummets and becomes slow and limp, making you lose interest at times. With a rather bittersweet interpretive ending, since they make you understand other things. Ideal to spend the afternoon."

The main character being somewhat of an antihero doesn't get much sympathy from me either. The premature plot twist too early makes the end of the film quite uninteresting and almost pointless. It may be the way the film was cut, or it's just as it is, a story that does well on a novel but not on a film.It certainly has the look and feel of the old italian films in general and that gave a very positive vibe to me. It's not a new masterpiece though."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11428926/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," A very beautiful movie ","This is one of the best movies I have seen on Netlfix. Somewhat reminiscent of "The Golden door" "The leopard" gorgeous camera work, slow pace, too intelligent maybe for most streaming audiences. It has some violence, it lacks clear intent in parts. The acting was suburb, the closeness of the villagers and the families was impressive and very well shown. The acting was first rate. The very final part was not suited to what had come before and seemed rather misplaced, but overall I would be very pleased if Netflix and others had more movies of this calibre."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11428926/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","1"," You can try to stand on the shoulders of giants... ","...but if you fall, you crash. The Last Paradiso toys with some classics of the Italian neo realism, from Rossellini to Germi and De Sica but it's like playing with fire if you can't master the stuff. Young director Ricciardulli has taken up a task way above his skills and he gets it wrong on so many levels that it hurts: from a silly screenplay with carton-board dialogues to worn out clichs. But where he fails mostly is with the tone of voice of his movie, which swings randomly from tragic (in the crudely violent scenes of mafia) to sugary lighthearted (in the corny romance scenes) without finding a cohesive unity, and a good photography is not enough to save the day."

I loved Cinema Paradiso... nope, L'ultimo was a different Paradiso. The photography and setting were reminiscent of parts of The Godfather, complete with a possible early Don Ciccio.... well, a prequel, it wasn't either. Neither did it develop as a struggle of olive growers against a repressive system, or a story of a blood feud as the Paradiso family seeks vengeance, nor any of a half dozen themes that are barely touch and then forgotten. And so it was for the next hour and a half, as the movie wandered from one potential story line to the next leaving a trail of unanswered questions, including an unlikely ending. I expected more, and kept hoping up to the credit roll. This was definitely not great Italian cinema."

It's a waste of time."

The setting had great potential and the period is a good one. It was very much like watching a spaghetti western, with the swagger just as over done. I couldn't wait for half the film before writing this. It just made me angry to watch it."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11428926/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," I was so wrong to write a review while watching! ","This film changed from 2/10 to 8/10 because of the 2nd half of the film. It's like watching a cross of spaghetti western for moods, Bollywood for filmography, or Shakespearen play for scenes. I was so annoyed at the 1950s rural Italian chauvinism, but once past that I was expecting full on Godfather. It wasn't, but it was fun."

Oh damn, it was boring. I knew it was going to be boring from watching the trailer but it's REAL boring. Modern Italian films aren't great anymore. I recently watched Two Women (La ciociara) and it was pretty good, which is currently free on Vudu or Prime Video btw, and I noticed something. I think the reason why Modern Italian films aren't good anymore because the films are basically GQ photoshoots... They look good, but there is no story."

However Rocco Ricciardulli was hopelessly mis-cast as the father of Riccardo Scamarcio. He didn't look like his son, he was far too young to be his father and was acting "too handsome" to be the sorrowful character he was supposed to be. In addition his wife looked more like his mother. So I checked the movie out on IMDB. Mystery solved. He co-wrote and directed the movie. Tip: don't cast yourself in a movie unless you fit the part."

Got angry with the character and along with them. It can bring tears.Well, it did on me... I was a little confused by the ending. Am I the only one?(SPOILERS ALERT)Antonio was trying to fix his own mistakes after murdering Biancas's family men or being guided by Ciccio spirit to came back and marry her? It doesn't explain if the both brothers were close before. Were they trying to imply some twin connection?

Young women being preyed just because they were poor and desperate.Two of these women were family members of mine. One being my grandmother, my father's mother and the other my Aunt my mother's sister both, bore children from it!The Italians suffered badly at the hands of greedy land owners and of course the Mafia! And to think these were the 50s not the dark ages. It makes me sad and angry to sit and watch what my father had to witness and many others the sufferance they had to endure.Even though l had to watch this alone with my own feelings and thoughts, a good illustration of the times in southern Italy.

The main actor although a good one , I couldn't stand his swagger and cold attitude towards his family and women. We are given very little in terms of his psychology as to why he is the way he is.A beautiful and dreamy film but I couldn't stand the shallowness of its main characters.The end has me confused on so many levels.

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11433048/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," Who Is This Movie For? ","I saw "Wild Indian", starring Michael Greyeyes-True Detective_tv, Fear the Walking Dead_tv; Chaske Spencer-Sneaky Pete_tv, the Twilight movies; Kate Bosworth-Superman Returns, Blue Crush and Jesse Eisenberg-the Zombieland movies, Batman v Superman:Dawn of Justice.Sometimes, I wonder about who a movie is targeted to. This is one of those and the only conclusion I can come to is the native American Indians. Michael & Chaske are cousins-native American Indians-that grew up together. As kids, Michael is abused by his father and does something bad-murder-and together with Chaske, they cover it up. Michael grows up, marries Kate and becomes successful. Jesse is his boss. Chaske, however, gets into trouble and goes to prison-drugs-but when he gets out, he feels a load of guilt about the murder they covered up as kids and decides to confess. Michael doesn't want his present perfect life disrupted and decides he and Chaske should talk about it. The talk does not go well. I think the main problem is that the lead character-Michael-is not a redeemable person so you can't feel for him. You can understand why he acts that way but he just keeps doing bad stuff with no consequences.It's not rated but it has language and violence and has a running time of 1 hour & 30 minutes.It's not one that I would buy on DVD. I wouldn't rent it, either. If you want to see it, I'd wait until it comes to cable."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11433048/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Sundance 2021: Wild Indian holds a compelling narrative but with an incredibly unlikable protagonist... ","If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Being this an Indigenous film and a feature directorial debut for Lyle Mitchell Corbine Jr., I really didn't know what to expect. Maybe that's why I enjoyed it more than I anticipated. Wild Indian takes a tragic, dark moment in an early phase of two characters' lives and follows an unconventional path to demonstrate how surprising someone's future can be, especially considering the younger-self personality. Everyone changes parts of themselves throughout life, even more during childhood and teenage years.Despite the overall slow pacing - slower than what I believe to be necessary - an efficient "twist" instantly raises the level of interest in the main narrative, which takes a while to overcome the fundamental yet formulaic character build-up. Then, Michael Greyeyes and Chaske Spencer bring their A-game, delivering engaging performances that kept me invested in the story. Greyeyes might portray the protagonist and have more screentime, but Spencer steals the spotlight with an emotionally devastating display.A solid debut from a writer-director to put an eye on during the next year, but I can't escape my main issue with the central character. Even though I fully understand the commentary that Lyle Mitchell Corbine Jr. successfully transmits to the viewers about so many important matters, I couldn't connect with the protagonist, much on the contrary. It's a frustrating feeling to have, but I find Greyeyes' character extremely unlikeable not only due to his actions in the past but mainly his attitude in the present. In addition to this, Jesse Eisenberg's casting choice feels out-of-place and weird, to say the least.Beautifully shot by Eli Born.Wild Indian is a strong feature directorial debut from Lyle Mitchell Corbine Jr., who I recommend following closely for the next few years. Boasting a compelling narrative, Michael Greyeyes and Chaske Spencer take the viewers through a dark, emotional journey of understanding that life isn't always fair and that making amends only works for people who can actually feel guilt or remorse. Both actors offer notable performances, but it's Spencer who really impacts me at an emotional level, elevating the only character I truly cared about. On the other hand, the protagonist is an incredibly unlikeable person who tries his hardest to forget the tragic past through deplorable actions. Jesse Eisenberg sadly sticks out like a sore thumb. The short runtime partially compensates for the slow pacing, but overall I still had a good time.Rating: B-"

If Jesse Eisenberg wasn't casted in this movie I never would of gave it a shot. Unfortunately he was hardly even in it. What a waste of time. It's a dismal story about an abused Native American kid who covers up a murder then grows up to be a stiff sociopathic weirdo. That's it. Nothing more nothing less. 5 stars."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11433048/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Undercooked ","I usually dont complain a lot about endings. Good, bad, it's the writer's story and they have a reason for that. The ending here is ok and I would have accepted if we have had a bit more moments of tension, more dialogue, more development of his PTSD, more something. I felt everything undercooked. When it finished, I asked to myself: "Is that it?".A shame because I was really liking the first two acts of the film until I realised that...it was already the end of the third one."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11433048/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," Repressed Potential ","The subject matter of this movie is EXTREMELY important. Unfortunately, this plays more like a fictional documentary by a dispassionate observer, moves extremely slow, lacks character development, and never provides access for the audience to feel what fundamentally motivates the characters.In the hands of a nascent writer/director, the story was not fully and cogently developed. This is made even more dissapointing by the fact that the writer/director is the child of a psychologist -- and the essential psychological elements were repressed, undeveloped, and never explicitly expressed in the story. I can only imagine that this reflects the writer/director's own personal predicament in life -- unhealed.Showing what happens is not nearly as engaging, emotive, and inspiring of compassion and empathy as exploring the fundamental reasons WHY it happens. Abstract causality merely conveys confusion on the part of the film maker -- perhaps reflecting his own unresolved confusion about life on the res."

","I'm Baffled by the other reviews some are good some are bad but the stars ratings are in the middle of 5 & 6 no body rates it 10 and nobody rates it 1. Which seems to be in lots of reviews some people have different ideas. I gave it a 2 cause this had nothing much to it. It was a waste of money and time to see this, I wished I had not. One thing I guess, it reflects what our life is like here in the USA. Bad people usually make it through life unscathed, good people get eaten up by the world around. Its does show that. I guess I like the bad guy getting some just reward, in the movies. It makes living life easier. Why is it categorized as a Thriller, I waited and wait for something thrilling to happen some suspense. The music was suspenseful but nothing happened..that put me on edge. I waited and waited for something thrilling to happen. Plus the outside of native peoples homes were in bad shape but inside had low income furniture but even the drunken abbusive people has spotless homes inside."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11433048/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," A lot of great potential ","WILD INDIAN is a film about the different paths that arise for people after experiencing traumatic events in their childhood.I really loved the concept, but ultimately I feel like it falls a bit flat. It starts very strong, but I think otherwise fails as a character study, and I didn't really feel anything for Makwa, any sort of relief or regret of what he did. He shows that of course, but again, did I feel it? Not really. Ted-o I think was a really interesting character that I wish we could have dived more into. I would have loved to see maybe more of his downfall.The story references and tries to mirror the story of Cain and Abel, which I think is a really interesting way to take a story like this, and I like that side of the film a lot. It's just focused on so little unfortunately and is quickly forgotten, similar to the flashback images at the start and end of the film.Overall, I think the cinematography by Eli Born is beautiful, as well as the dark brooding score by Gavin Brivik. There's so much here that you can like, but I think there's also reasons why not to.But really I think the most distracting/disappointing part was Jesse Eisenberg. I love Jesse, don't get me wrong. I think he's great in everything I've seen him in. But the presence of him being in a total of like 3 minutes of the film, seems like a bit of a miscast.The director and writer, Lyle Corbine, seems that he has a lot going for him and he should definitely have your sights on him for the future.

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11436498/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," I'm in love ","Man, this movie got me.It starts as a simple criminal -- Fin (Zachary Mooren) -- on the run caper. He's just gotten out of a deal gone wrong and ducks away from the cops and into a mansion, where he thinks he'll have some time for the heat to die down. That's when he learns that he isn't alone.The house belongs to Val.Expertly played by Misha Reeves -- who was also in Electric Love, another movie directed by Aaron Fradkin and co-starring Mooren -- Val starts the film very matter of factly explaining her work: she entertains men, gives them a fantasy and often finds herself breaking down the most physically imposing men and making them crawl around on a leash. Kind of like Freddy (Erik Griffin, Montez from Workaholics who, yes, was also in Electric Love), who bursts into the house with one eye whited out and a body full of threat and swagger before being laid low by just a word from the redhead spitfire that's really running things.That's the thing. Fin thinks that he's in control, but he's been continually led around (mostly by his girlfriend Jenny, who is played by co-writer Victoria Fratz), lied to and used. Even if he grabs that ceremonial dagger that Val for some reason keeps in her kitchen, it's going to take more than that to get past one of the smartest women he'll ever meet.If she is a woman. Because by the end, we learn that she just might be Valefar, the patron demon of thieves, the one who encourages them to have a good relationship with one another. She keeps offering Fin choices, like the opportunity to be hers, and the chance to stop the spinning wheel that is his life and actually be like her and call the shots. Not everyone is cut out for that.By the end of the film, it's become a broad -- yet gore-drenched -- comedy with a cop's live head on a plate and Fin being given one last opportunity to live his own life. Unless he just wants to serve in Heaven, rather than rule in Hell. But one gets the feeling that Val isn't one to share the throne.I loved everything about this film, from its bold colors to its throwback to another era of snappy dialogue back and forth between its leads. Much like the character that it's named for, Val will slowly win you into its confidence and then own you. And hey -- it's only 81 minutes long, so it's not that Faustian of a bargain."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11436498/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Interesting ","A fugitive from helicopters and cop-cars invades a dominatrix's home just as she is expecting a client to call. She is a little too strong for the man on the run...and she won't SHUT UP. I love that she disregard's his demands, but, alas, it's because she CAN. She isn't the devil she appears to be and it does get interesting."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11436498/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," Genius ","Clever, cerebral, funny, dark original, fulfilling, entertaining. Superb acting all around. Props to Misha and Zachery. Misha should, if not already, be under Ryan Murphy's radar. Her quaint and substantial acting chops are ripe and her star is clearly shining for bigger better roles. Good job on this surprise gem of a movie. The plot was sharp, crisp and not a moment of bore."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11436498/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","3"," Slow start... predictable, lame ending ","Yes, yes, yes and yes to all the obvious "Beetle Juice meets Sam Raimi in the Twilight Zone" comments. Really, that's it. That's the entire film.The first 3/4 of the film is merely an annoying "comedy" spread over a decent suspense story. It could have worked if they didn't have to shovel in some inane supernatural stuff at the end.Overall, sorta entertaining and the cast was quite good. It's just not anything you'd recommend to anyone or watch more than once."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11436498/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","1"," Terrible ","Terrible, terrible, undeniably terrible acting from the first second.Dreadful direction, sapping the tension from anything that could have been tense.Jarring dialogue.Distractingly poor hair and makeup.Grandiose, overblown score.This money could seriously have been better spent."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11436498/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Not bad but predictable ","The acting was a bit over the top and the plot clearly signalled where it was going. Not scary or to be taken seriously. No where as good as the other reviews so far suggest."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11436498/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","1"," i tried to like it.....but ","This movie was a load of crap period ..... i hated this movie from the beginning. The acting was even less than mediocre ..... the story just plain sucks .... the people who made this wasted my time so screw you .....don't waste your time with it."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11436498/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," The Twilight Zone: Beetlejuice Edition! ","I saw someone else compare this film to the Twilight Zone and it really stuck with me. That's a perfect comparison to the beginning of the film where this criminal breaks into the home of a sinister Lucille Ball type escort and everything feels---like a carnival funhouse.Spoilers ahead! We're slowly led further into this funhouse (Val's house) until we've run out of breadcrumbs and the only way back is this recurring holy roman knife and a climactic faustian decision which is all told through the POV of our protagonist, Fin.I really loved Val and found both the actress and actor playing the lead roles to have knocked it out of the park. The director, Aaron Fradkin, is someone I've really enjoyed watching grow as a storyteller. Admittedly I probably would have given Val an 8.5 but I rounded up because I've been following this filmmaker duo's work from their short horror films on YouTube and I see how much work they put into each one of their projects.There's something very refreshing about Val after a sea of traditional horror films, Val feels like a demonic breath of fresh air."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11436498/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Slow start with a POW finish! ","Gave this one a shot as I found it in the "new & popular" movies category on Comcast and we were pleasantly surprised. Fun concept with a small cast and one really cool house that about 99% of the film takes place in.As the film opens, I wasn't really sure what I was in for but the two leads kept dishing out little gems that kept me entertained. Then it all ramps up in the 3rd act with a dynamite ending! Really my favorite (and most memorable) part. I wish more of the film lived in this 3rd act energy but I was left satisfied and satiated.Would recommend if you want something very DIFFERENT than what's been served to us in the mainstream!"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11436498/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," Pure, fun, edge of your seat entertainment ","Cutting to the chase, I don't like horror films BUT I LOVED VAL! Why? Because the characters and plot are multi-dimensional, it's comical in a subtle, take you by surprise way, the acting and directing superb. Need a break from this crazy world? Watch this movie!"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11436498/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," You can call me Val ","This is very out of the ordinary. This movie is fun, witty, and artistic. You will be surprised and entertained. The script is cleverly written and the acting and lighting are a treat. The flashback scenes and the ending are surprising and well done! You will enjoy this comedy thriller."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11436498/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Beetlejuice and The Fugitive get a room ","I've followed these creators since their short horror films started popping up in my YouTube feed so I was very curious to see a feature length film from them.Very good film! The opening lives in a "cat and mouse" style of story and then **SPOILERS AHEAD** ......suddenly the mouse hunts the cat. Really enjoyed the concept and I like these filmmakers. Looking forward to keeping an eye out for what they do next."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11436498/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," Add this to your Halloween Watchlist! ","Are you, like me, sad that there are few films that match the campy magic of Beetlejuice? Do you flip through lists of movies hoping to find something that isn't just a run-of-the-mill slasher, a sadistic torture porn or a ho-hum seen it before villain? If you are like me, definitely throw Val on for an evening of thrills, spills and chills. The acting is impeccable, the director is sure-handed and the script will leave you guessing -- a perfect pairing of sly winks to horror classics, suspenseful turns and a few gutbusting lines. Run, don't walk, and get a copy of Val! Better yet, throw it on for a big party and have a great time with friends."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11436498/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," Stylish, strange and clever ","This movie was a really fun time. If you are a horror buff I really think you'll enjoy this, but at the same time it's pretty accessible to those that usually don't enjoy horror films(ie me). There aren't any stupid cliches, over the top jump scares or any dumb decisions that characters make just to move the plot forward.What I really liked: The music and atmosphere. The music here is on point, and the thumping loud sounds really bring the mansion to life. I love the way the director uses music and blur to create a real sense of disorientation and confusion, which Finn( Zachary Moren) is clearly going through a lot of. The film starts out seemingly ordinary and through little details slowly starts to reveal that it is anything but.The acting: Mischa Reeves as Val was incredible in this film. She is charismatic, mysterious and terrifying. It is difficult to describe specifics of what makes her performance great without spoiling so I will just say there are hints of foreshadowing that can be seen and make it that much more impressive on second viewing. The rest of the cast ranged from fine to great, no complaints really but Reeves was definitely a stand out and was easily the most entertaining character to watch.The effects:For a relatively small budget Indy flick this film has very good visual/special effects. This shouldn't come as a surprise if you have been following the creators on YouTube this past year as they have been creating a slew of horror shorts that have seemed to have been the perfect medium for them to hone their effect skills. Well done.What I didn't like:Meandering story early on The main issue I had with this movie is that you don't really get too much information on what the story actually is until well past the halfway mark. There is a point when things kind of click and you see where everything thing is going, I just wish that moment came sooner.Overall- 8.5. Really solid stylized flick that struggles early on but once you're in you are hooked for the rest of the run time and you end up leaving on a relatively high note. I would recommend checking this one out, soon if you can as it is the perfect spooktober film to watch with some friends."

It's a pitch perfect horror comedy that will keep you guessing until the very end!! Just when you think you know where it's headed, the story totally turns on its head.

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11436498/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," A superb film, possibly best film of the year. ","This thriller is brilliantly scripted keeping you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end! The ending was totally unexpected and thrilling! If you want a tight fitting screenplay, perfectly executed with superb acting and cinematography, then choose this film. It will not disappoint!"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11436498/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," Be prepared to be thrilled with a smile on your face ;) ","Val combines subtle humoristic dialogue in a thriller that turns itself upside down through the course of the story. A game of "cat and mouse" is in play when "Fin" breaks into the house of "Val" and nothing is quite as it seems with any of the characters in this movie. The movie feels like a cross between "The Devil's Advocate" and "Beetlejuice" and contains a wonderful score and some excellent camera work. Pay particular attention to the camera work of the opening scene after intro credits. ;) A must watch for your spooktacular October!"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11436686/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," St. Patrick's Day (2021) ","The selection of St. Patrick's Day horror films are pretty slim. Horror fans will be glad "St. Patrick's Day" has been added to the holiday horror movie list.Special thanks to Spring Lane Studios for a special viewing for an honest review."St. Patrick's Day" has a 80s horror vibe to it, with it's use of synthesizers in the background music and the grainy camcorder POV shots. Lots of emphasis on green; green overlays.Even though the title of the film is "St. Patrick's Day" there isn't any Irish culture or history to be seen here. No evil leprechauns, rainbows, or pots of gold either. The film's night of horrors just takes place on the Irish holiday.A night of boozey fun leads to the party goers dying one by one.In my opinion, the film wasn't scary but still in enjoyable for hoilday horror's sake. Kills were slow like an 80s film horror, not gorey or too bloody, but enough blood. Acting was decent.There was one thing that bothered me while watching the film. The actors seemed to be a little old to playing high school seniors. It'd been more believable if they were playing college seniors.I recommend watching the "St. Patrick's Day" horror film for the sake of the hoilday and supporting indie films."
