He runs a podcast in Tampa where other folks call in to tell their stories. He uses that information, plus what he gets from a rogue cop and goes vigilante over dealers, doctors, and big Pharma CEOs who live in small unprotected homes. He wears a mask, but it is hard not to know it is him. Michael Par plays a doctor who easily prescribes painkillers.The dialogue was dry as were the shootings. Bill walks up to the guy in a mask, tells him he is bad, and then shoots him six times because that is all the bullets his gun holds. Boring like bad talk radio.Guide: sex. No nudity.

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10799922/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," Opioid crisis ","Bill Johnson (Bill Oberst Jr.) has lost his daughter to an opioid overdose and while his podcast about the epidemic helps him deal with the loss, he still feels like he could do more. Perhaps something like wearing a mask and becoming a vigiilante out to violently stop the sale of pills? That seems like a plan.Director Mark Savage - who co-wrote this with Tom Parnell* - makes a lean and mean Death Wish for today out of this movie. It's tightly edited and pulses with energy, never outstaying its welcome. Some may be put off by the heavy messaging in the movie, but it definitely believes in its subject matter. That's because Parnell lost his daughter to a opioid overdose, so you can completely understand his mindset here.What also helps make this movie better than expectations are its stars. Michael Par is a long-time favorite and, as always, he brings something extra to his role. And Oberst knows how to play the damaged hero quite well. This could have been simple wish fulfillment, but boh actors add a gravitas to this film that take it a step above.*They've worked together to make the movies Purgatory Road and Stressed to Kill as well, the latter of which features Oberst's character killing people to keep his blood pressure down. Plus, it has Armand Assante in it! Painkiller was originally called Stressed to Kill: Doctor's Orders, so it is a spiritual sequel at the very least."

The decent pacing and 85 min runtime made it flow nicely, even if you knew what was coming up.

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10799922/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," Definitely a must see film! ","As a chronic pain patient, I was a bit hesitant at first. Pain patients receive so much judgement so the last thing I wanted to see was a movie which would make me feel bad for something I cannot control. However, Painkiller tackles a real problem. The same problem that causes so many tragic deaths ironically also causes so many pain chronic pain patients to feel judged, depressed, defeated and even suicidal. Painkiller tackles the reason behind the opioid epidemic, greedy pharmaceutical companies, greedy Doctors who dishonor their Hippocratic Oath to DO NO HARM, the lack of resources for law enforcement to tackle the issue and the drug dealers.Listening to the main character Bill as he comforts a parent who lost a child to an overdose while dealing with his own loss really broke my heart. Watching Bill take matters into his own hands to avenge his daughter's death was satisfying. What parent wouldn't do everything in their power to bring their child's killer to justice? Tom Parnell as Doctor Mac is the epitome of a great Doctor. Yet no good deed goes unpunished. Enter Michael Pare as Doctor Rhodes who not only steals Good Doctor Mac's wife but destroys his career when Doctor Mac refuses to market a drug meant to help heart patients as yet another PAINKILLER.Supporting characters Alexander Pennecke as RIP, Kalimah Gaston as Janet Simone and Kristina Berenger as Lisa really strengthened each scene. Bill Oberst Jr and Tom Parnell really compliment each other. The action scenes were organic. This movie will touch on all of your emotions. Mark Savage, Tom Parnell and David Richardson are a creative power team. Director Mark Savage is a fearless genius. Everything about Painkiller works. I highly recommend it."

It's a pantomime from beginning to end, so without knowing what to expect, you'll have no idea what you're watching. It relies 100% on the atmosphere created by sounds, music, the occasional grunt, and cinematography to tell the story. Why someone would put something like this together that lasts 1h 22min is the big question. Somebody had to have written a story line, that's obvious, and it actually makes sense, but at the 56 minute mark I found myself saying the only reason to watch any longer was for the final kill. By that time I was hoping for a plot twist. *SPOILER ALERT* ....this is a gin and tonic with no lime. It's not a plot twist if you see it coming. Why they threw the bs about "He has one night, that's the time limit he gave to himself." in the synopsis was a red herring.I've read some of the other reviews and after watching the film I found them to be quite harsh.

Ben leaps off the screen and my concern for his welfare left me holding my breath for most of the film.

It really makes you think about things in America in a different way and flips the script on a lot of common stereotypes so what you think is happening isn't at all. And it also makes you realize how some criminals are trying to survive etc, and end up getting caught in huge complex crimes that they never intended to be involved with and cannot escape once they're in. The main character Jack is unlikeable at first but by the end you feel bad for the dude. Many times along the way he finds himself questioning his ethics and recognizing his own cognitive dissonance. The film definitely keeps you on edge throughout, loved it. Not every day you get a plot with some real substance and the acting is amazing too. If you look up some of the actor profiles after watching, you would never guess they would play these characters so well and that's truly the definition of a great actor. Also the cinematography is A+."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10820008/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","2"," Well, they tried ","One of my favorite independent movie games to play is "how will people work Eric Roberts into their movie?" Much like John Carradine, they often shoot him completely independent of their film and then splice him in, getting his name recognition while not having him matter at all narratively. I applaud this notion and a reminder of the better times of Z-grade cinema when a Mexican werewolf movie would suddenly be a mummy film and Carradine would be out there standing in front of a desk trying to scientifically explain it to us while hiding a whiskey neat in the side drawer.Eric comes in here as the memories of our heroine Aella (Mair Mulroney), a girl who can't get work until a job offer comes to audition for a movie about a female fight club. She gets hired, knocked out and shows up in a private video feed - hello Red Room - to fight for her life while people watch online.To make this even better, the director's name is Raphaello. That's it - one imagines that he's two of the Ninja Turtles joined up to make a fighting film. Or maybe just the guy who also made Rogue Planet Gamma and Bloodbath: The Motion Picture.One of the selling points of this movie is that it features pro wrestler Taya Valkyrie, currently known as Frankie Monet in NXT, who is the wife of WWE superstar - and star of low budget action movies on the side - John Hennigan (Johnny Nitro/Retro/you fill in the blank). She's the trainer of the girls, Regina, and she's someone trained to do fighting yet never fights in the film. Instead, she works for The Warden, who threatens women throughout the movie.Rock Riddle is also in this. He was a pro wrestler who got his start running the Rip Hawk and Swede Hanson fan club before getting into the ring himself. He also shows up in The Van, Blue Sunshine, Paradise Alley and a few other movies.I mean, we could use more women being coerced into fight club movies. This one barely scratches that itch.

Unchained is Grungy Midnight Cinema. Girls brawling. The lead actress, Mair shines and capably carries the movie. I looked up the cast to see what else she was in. While doing so, I noticed WWE star Taya Valkre was also in Unchained which may be a boon for some of you viewers, note I'm not an avid WWE viewer. I also saw Tim Chizmar produced this, I've actually seen other stuff by him, he's done a lot, so if you're a fan then you'll dig this too. Anyway I see that Mair also has a bunch of credits (mostly indie looking) so she's actually a seasoned actor and that explains why she has the chops to carry this flick.

We've all heard the phrase, but is it accurate ... at least mostly? Writer-director Todd Stephens met the real life Pat Pitsenbarger in a small town gay bar, and he turned that person into this engaging story by casting the great Udo Kier in the lead. When we first meet Pat, he's living a life of daily drudgery in a nursing home. He's a curmudgeon whose hobbies are folding (perfectly) the paper napkins he takes from the cafeteria, and sneaking a smoke when no one is looking. We also see how tenderly he treats an incapacitated neighbor. It's not the last time we see his two sides.Pat was once a renowned hairdresser in Sandusky, Ohio. When he is informed that a long-time former (wealthy) client has passed away, and her dying wish was for Pat to do her hair for the funeral, he sneaks out of the home and begins a road trip down memory lane. Despite Pat spending the time on foot, the film has the feel of a true road trip movie as he crosses paths with many folks - some new and some with ties to his previous life. One of his first stops is the graveyard to visit his life partner who died of AIDS. We realize Pat still grieves.There is a hilarious stop at a convenience store as he tries to knock off the items on his shopping list for the project. Since he has no money, Pat depends on the kindness of others ... and his own sticky fingers. As he makes his way through town, some folks remember him, while others remind him of how long he's been gone and how much has changed. His house and business may be gone, but his memories remain.Two folks from his past generate tremendous scenes. Pat confronts Dee Dee Dale (a reserved Jennifer Coolidge) who gets to tell her side of the story of their unpleasant business split so many years ago. Even better is a "conversation" in the park with his old friend Eunice (a superb Ira Hawkins). The two old friends toast the bygone days of their gay club, while also acknowledging the new world of the gay community. It's a touching sequence.But the most surprising portion of the film occurs at the funeral home, where Pat imagines a final chat with that recently deceased client, Rita Parker-Sloan. What a pleasant surprise (actually shock!) to see Linda Evans back on screen. She is terrific in her brief appearance and we've really missed her over the last 23 years. But this film belongs to Udo Kier, and he kills. Pat is known as "The Liberace of Sandusky" and Kier embraces all that entails. This is a sentimental story punctuated by a spirited performance - and a Shirley Bassey song!"

As a result, I was a bit disappointed.Udo Kier is wonderfully cast as Pat Pitsenbarger - I mean, this is Udo Kier like you've never seen him before! Pat was once a successful hairdresser, and performer. Although the film shows us glimpses of his past, I wanted to see and know more about the former Pat. I somehow feel the film would have been more interesting had they chronicled his life, instead of mere back flashes.The premise is a bit strange. One of Pat's once regular clients is deceased, and her will stipulated him to do her hair for the funeral, and will be richly rewarded. Due to a feud between them years ago, Pat is initially reluctant, but decides to do it anyway. He then travels mainly on foot to a town called Sandusky. Despite some funny moments here and there, I found the film a bit dreary at times. It was also much more dramatic than I had anticipated. Then again, as mentioned, I had a pre-conceived idea what the film was going to be about, and that was a bit unfair towards 'Swan Song'.Nevertheless, 'Swan Song' was still entertaining. It also offers a nostalgic look at how quickly time passes us by. We should indeed live every day like there's no tomorrow, and not take everything for granted. We so egotistically believe in a tomorrow...Udo Kier's great performance makes the movie well worth it. It was also good seeing Linda Evans back in front of the camera again after a long absence - and she's looking incredible still! 'Swan Song' deserves at least one viewing."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10832274/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," A road movie within Sandusky, Ohio ","Swan Song (II) (2021) was written and directed by Todd Stephens. It's a narrative film, but the protagonist, Pat Pitsenbarger was a well-known flamboyant gay hairdresser in Sandusky. When director Stephens was young, he knew Pitsenbarger. Also, Stephens gathered anecdotes about Pitsenbarger from other people who had known him.Pitsenbarger is portrayed by Udo Kier, who is a brilliant actor. The movie rises or falls on the talent of the protagonist, and in this case it rises.Pitsenbarger has retired from hairdressing, but he has been called from retirement to dress the hair of a wealthy woman who has died.This is, indeed, a road movie, but the road leads from Pitsenbarger's nursing home to the funeral home, both of which are in Sandusky. The plot consists of his encounters as he walks out of the facility and heads towards the funeral home.This may sound like a pretty feeble premise, but it's just the opposite. The movie was overlooked when it was released. In fact, I'm just the second person to review it. That's too bad, because it's really good film. The movie has an excellent IMDb rating of 7.6. However, that's based on the ratings of just 44 IMDb members. I though it was much better than that, and rated it 9.P. S. See if you can recognize the dead woman, named Rita Parker Sloan. (She appears in flashbacks and in Pitsenbarger's memories.) She's almost 80 years old, and she still looks great."

Though all film fans should know Udo Kier, since he's been appearing in things nonstop since the 60's, this is the perfect time to get to know him if you don't already. I came across this one on streaming (Hulu) with a friend and we are both so immensely glad we noticed it and decided to give it a chance. It's one of the my favorite movies of 2021.The plot is a bit like The Peanut Butter Falcon, another fantastic heartwarming movie from a couple years back. Udo plays a regionally infamous stylist who's been rotting away in an old folks home, but upon a request to style an old client for her funeral, he decides to ditch the retirement community and go on a mission to acquire his old favorite products, in order to do the best possible job he can with his old friend's corpse!Precious dark comedy, through and through. Never a dull moment. There are a few cast members and conversations that are a bit off-putting and pull you out of the movie a bit with their amateurish presence, but that aside this is a near-masterpiece for anyone can appreciate the sub-genre. It's really just entirely hilarious and endearing! Perhaps we need more movies about old people...and maybe more specifically, old gay men! So refreshing and fantastic."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10832274/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," great indie ","Very poetic, colourful, sad and uplifting at the same time. Not without shortcomings, too slow at times, but real and heart breaking. Great to see Jennifer Coolidge in a more down to earth part, without that silly voice of hers. 10 for story and effort."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10832274/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","2"," Grim and bleak ","Let's be honest: if a straight director delivered this movie the vast majority of gay men would be rightly incensed at the dismal parade of two-dimensional stereotypes. Every gay character in Swan Song is cut from the same polyester cloth - the swishy-bitchy central character, Pat... the swishy-bitchy hairdresser... the swishy bartender... the swishy drag queen... etc. There's a couple of gay dads who appear briefly, but they don't get to talk, so we never get to know how swishy they are. I started to wonder: could there even be this many screaming queens in Sandusky, Ohio (with a population of 25,000)? The 10 star reviews here might suggest there is still an audience for this kind of gay flick, but to me Swan Song is even more desperately dated and wrist-slashingly grim than the original Boys in the Band or La Cage aux Folles. The movie is supposedly a heartfelt tribute to a much-loved Sandusky hairdresser, but a quick google search leaves me wondering just how heartfelt and how much of a tribute it really is. For one thing, the real Mr Pat was not German, which makes the casting of Udo Kier a dubious move. More crucially, despite an end credit thanking people for their stories about Mr Pat, the film character is entirely superficial. He wears a lot of rings, smokes a particular brand of cigarettes, etc. But if there were fascinating anecdotes that reveal his character and illuminate his life and struggles, then they haven't made the movie since both the narrative and the back story is entirely unsurprising."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10832274/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," Oscar worthy! ","It has class, soul, empathy, nostalgia, passage, character, value......and its timeless gem of a movie. Udo deserves critical acclaim for his role that embodies all these. Thank you for this beautiful and precious piece of exquisite vintage."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10832274/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," Bright blue ","It's very talented slow burn indie movie with its own tone of voice. It's not for everyone, so I do understand some negative review as this movie is special. But I am happy that This masterpiece made me and other viewers to cry and smile, really thankful creators for such touching and truly bright blue movie."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10832274/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," Udo Kier shines ","Just saw Swan Song, and I was totally taken with Udo Kier's performance as Pat. He is a retired hairdresser and gay cabaret performer who lives in a nursing home. When he is offered 25K to do the hair & makeup on a deceased friend ( Linda Evans); he initially refuses . But he then leaves the home to do the job. We find out why he at first refused to help, and his story unfolds as he walks through the streets of Sandusky, Ohio. He meets old and new friends and each plays a part in telling his story.Great supporting cast with Jennifer Coolidge, Michael Urie and even Linda Evans in a brief appearance.A lovely movie about growing old as a gay man, and the lives that were lived back in the days of bars and drag shows, and how gay life has evolved and changed. And how one man , dubbed the Liberace of Sandusky found out how many lives he actually touched."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10832274/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Very poignant and important film... ","A very touching film regardless of it's gay theme. That said, it's the gay theme that makes this film truly special.This lovely slice of love film documents the life of a member of "the lost generation" of gay men, most of whom died during the AIDS crisis. Very few are left. And very few have had their lives dramatized in such a touching way.This film also tells a fascinating story, in a very authentic way, of how a "flamboyant" gay man lived-or moreover "survived"- in a small American southern town during a time a few decades ago now when it was NOT okay at all to be gay, especially if your personality just so big than you could not hide your fabulous gayness no matter how much you tried.Such men often had no choice other than to pursue one of a few select careers (florist, hairdresser, waiter, mortician, etc.) that society deemed "acceptable" for gay men, assuming you didn't announce your gayness to most people These jobs were often the ONLY choice for such gay men.That said, if you could actually hide your homosexuality enough in a convincing way, you could pursue a other more mainstream career, but if you did, such careers were often cut short if you were discovered or "outed." And to add insult to injury, these outed men would not only lose their jobs, but they would often.face criminal charges, go to prison, and be shunned, their lives now ruined.Most of these brave men (both in or out of the closet during these times) are now part of history, many tragically eventually dying in the 80s and early 90s from HIV-related illnesses.Very few of this "lost generation" of gay men survive, and those that do probably still think no one would be interested in their story. How wrong they are. This movie proves that point.Gratefully, we have arrived at a time that the public, and especially younger gay men, now actually want...and need...to hear these stories.This film competently portrays one such story-a story of fabulousness but also of love and loss and the realities of living in those homophobic times, especially when AIDS created even more fear and distain for the gay community, especially in small town America.This story is an important one, and an enjoyable and meaningful film to watch too. It has its sad moments, but also is an uplifting and inspiring story, a journey of this one amazing unapologetic gay citizen of a small town from a few decades "back in the day.".I give it a bug 2 thumbs up. !"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10832274/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," If you enjoyed The Straight Story, Peanut Butter Falcon ","People are a little too nice at times in this But it makes you wish people were.It was more dramatic and filled with a realism I wasn't expecting but am so happy it was.Belongs to many With a realism for love.Kudos to everyone involved for a perfect film!"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10832274/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Very nice ","Very nicely done. I expected it to be about a different topic, but I'm fine with what I watched. For me, the choice of music had a great part why I liked it. It's a quiet movie and I LOVE such if they're done well. Many times when just sad classical music is used, it totally freaks me out and I instantly stop watching and skip the movie. Swan Song didn't make this mistake and so I can honestly recommend this movie. Of course also because the story is quite nice,"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10832274/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Dark, heartbreaking, infuriating ","There is much to recommend this movie: moments of absurd, tender, unexpected humor, the brilliance of Udo Kier, and the concept itself. Otoh, I found myself at times thinking that the director was culturally appropriating the very culture he is a part of. Some tiresome, cringe inducing bits about drag queens and a talk with an old friend on a bench that try way too hard. But those are really minor quibbles. This is a brilliant piece of work."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10832274/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," Another Advert Movie ","Movie is not good but not so bad. If you would like to watch hidden adverts and stupid advert dialogs more than film then this one good for you."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10832274/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Dusted with a touch of Fantasy ","Really enjoyed this movie, and Udo Kier is great fun. Don't pick it apart over a few details - take it as a bit of fantasy, and you're in for a great time. While SWAN SONG is a smaller movie, it reminds me of BIG EDEN in terms of story elements that you just accept and go with. Thank you Todd Stephens - I Love it!"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10832274/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," I cried... the entire movie! ","I didn't know what to expect, but I knew I had to watch this movie at the local SF Landmark Cinema. Being the fourth attendee on a Wednesday night, I basically had the entire theater to myself. Once the movie started, the four of us could not stop laughing, hooting and crying!!!The protagonist "Pat" or "Mr. Pat" is played by the incomparable Udo Kier - The most beautiful Warholian muse of the seventies! We follow Pat from his retirement home onward, to fulfill a close companion's last wish in their rural hometown. Through the eyes of a senior member of the Gay (All inclusive LGBTQIA+) community, we get to experience his many years of life, love, grief and happiness. These memories are preserved so effortlessly in Udo's craft, and the beautiful work provided by the supporting actors.I cried and I laughed throughout... and I believe once you leave the theater, you too will feel a connection with this masterpiece. A+PS: Please let there be a release of the soundtrack!"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10832274/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," Brilliant ","I rarely write reviews, but this was such a brilliantly acted and written film, it was beautiful."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10832274/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," Perfection. ","Kudos and blessings on Todd Stephens and Udo Kier for making an absolutely perfect movie. Acting, writing, casting, cinematography, editing, set design, costumes, soundtrack, music selections (two Shirleys.....Bassey AND Horn) and directing... it's all perfect.(The scene with Pat treating his fellow resident to a makeover brings to mind the scene in All That Jazz when Joe comforts a fellow hospital patient, and tops it.)Go. See. Laugh. Cry. Enjoy."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10832274/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Oddly memorable and empathy driven. ","1. The title's 3fold-solid with Swan Song implying 'a final goodbye act' + a swan as a gay meaning + his peak in the movie was doing a song. -Fully literal.2. Am not a fan of gay theme movies but Udo's performance of strength and frailty is compelled viewing.3. The backdrop story/town setting is easily relatable to and a character study in itself.4. Even if you treat all the gay stuff as incidental the themes of generational dying, rebirth and reflection are what made the movie subtlety profound.5. Again, Udo using just silence and nuance can hypnotize, convince you to hear the loud screaming in his head. Udo should get some award for his 'enchante' performance. ."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10832274/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," simply-a Fine Film ","Count on Magnolia Films to deliver a grown-ups film.

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10837952/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," Great Low Budget Film ","This is a perfect movie. The story is great and it was produced on a small budget. There filming locations were also in my hometown so that was very cool."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10840042/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," a beautiful shot... ","Movie of an estranged kind of life , for the grumpy old man to phatom due to 2 generation of technological and sociological development that has passed me by in the sideglance, and a story about the introvertiness and dependency on digital devices to maintain a full worth lifestyle, spiced up with sex and beauty, peppered with some mental issues, pretty intense psychology that might be hard to swallow for some viewers, because this is a more common lifestory among the young ones than you think.Its voices in the head, its selfharming, even suicide attempts, its the constant feeling of being controlled and punished by the ones you unfold your life for, a splendid mix of fact of fiction and desillusions. But the story ends unfortunatelly in a big wet thundery question style, could that mean a secondary sequele will come in the near future???Well its filmographical quality are amazing, so is the musical score, and the physical acts by the main cast. So if you feel bewildered in the start , youll be even worse in the end, its hard to seperate facts from fiction, and a tiny little timeline could easily have helped a lot, cause there are some flashback to put in the trolly. Even though that said, you wont get braindamaged to watch this, cause its actuality in true life excists. A should see movie for all under 40. A recommend."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10840042/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," ugh ","Really wasnt what i expected. Majority of the movie is about one woman who cant catch a break because she comes from a broken home and constantly puts herself into sticky situations. She makes obvious bad decisions, as a viewer i found it hard to believe anyone would make such stupid choices. It was hard to feel bad for her. 99% of the movie is basically a drama about her life while she is communicating with a mysterious woman, who claimed to be the author of a famous book, but was later proven to be a liar, and is just some random stranger.The character knows this but continues talking to them. Another stupid decision. And then when we finally get the meat and potatoes of why i even decided to watch this, it happens at the very end, and we dont even see anything just a loud sound effect. Very irritating. They gave us this huge build up and it leads to nothing. I get what they were trying to do but still.We hear voice overs of this character and katie, while they type online, and sometimes it was hard to tell whose voice it was, cause they sound so similar."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10840042/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," Allison Burnett writes & directs again ","For those of you who haven't seen Ask Me Anything, also by Allison Burnett, I highly recommend it.Another Girl delves into the alienation caused by searching for attention, validation, and possibly companionship via our screens.Samantha Hanratty does an excellent job as a lead, the direction and writing is second to none, and the cinematography is a 10.Enjoy."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10840042/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," Danger can lurk around any corner ","This is a good indie film with a fabulous performance by Sammi Hanratty.

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10840042/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," A perfect film for the zeitgeist ","In a Y/A landscape filled with bland, unrealistic rom-coms and relentlessly dark TV series, it was incredibly refreshing to stumble across ANOTHER GIRL, a film that incorporates the frail mental health of today's youth into a gripping, thrilling storyline. This is a film that will leave you guessing as you watch, then thinking once you're finished."

Allison Burnett has made another wonderful movie ","This movie is the sequel to Undiscovered Gyrl, (movie name "Ask Me Anything"). From the very beginning you can pick up that Elle is troubled and she reaches out to a fictitious character after reading the first book. Even though the author even tells her that Katie (the girl from the book) is not real she still keeps writing to the person and telling her story, which is in fact a very sad story. She believes she has found a friend in the fake Katie Kampenfelt. She ignores the red flags (that Katie always has an excuse, she won't give out her phone number, etc.) . In this movie you can really get to see how being desperate for someone to talk to can ultimately have some bad consequences. And it leaves you with questions so you can decide what happened yourself with what was shown. Ultimately it's a great movie that is enjoyable, and makes you think at the same time. I would definitely recommend watching it."

","Honestly this was terrible, some of the things that come out of the protagonists mouth "what do you eat when you bleed?" Women do not talk like this to each other it was cringe.

The idea behind it has something interesting to it but the actual conversations and decisions the characters make is infuriating and laughable."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10841088/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," A wonderful addition to the franchise ","Riverdance. Once aired on the Irish competition during the nineties and it became the most phenomenal stage show in history. Both Jean Butler and Micheal Flatly rose to stardom overnight after their seven minute performance which turned into a global success wowing audiences for the next ten years paving the way for new stage acts.Riverdance the animated movie captured the essence with mysterious lands of magic graced with deer creatures who supposedly were the originators of the mystic dance routine in order to keep the waters flowing. It was a culmination between folk lore and legend. What made the film more desirable was that the original composer, Bill Whelan oversaw the music through out, and it was top notch.It is a great ride through the eyes Keegan. A boy tasked of continuing to keep watch over the rivers with the help of friends, family, music and dance. All of which continues to this day in Ireland on a more present day level, but on stage around the world.I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of Riverdance. It has become part of our culture, history and fables with the help of two people who started it all on stage in front of a captivated audience in 1994. Thanks to them along with the dance troupe this film allows us to let our imaginations flow more freely to keep darkness at bay. A wonderful addition to the franchise. Ten out of ten stars."

I knew of the 1990s phenomena of Riverdance, but wasn't allowing this to have a bearing on my review. I am sorry, but the reviews that give this movie a 10, are either by people connected to the film, or children.It was complete nonsense and I am sorry I took the time to watch it.Don't bother as it's just stupid.1/10."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10841088/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," Good Story With Brilliant Animation ","Who woulda' thought it? "Riverdance" as an animated feature? Yet what they did is blend real life with Irish "mythology" & mythological creatures & Irish music to come up with a fantasy film everyone can enjoy.As for the dance, this is NOT a musical but it does have musical moments. If anyone has seen either a bit of the show "Riverdance" or even Irish dancing, then they qlwill have to admit just how brilliant the animation in this movie is. Especially the one number performed by the "Megaloceros Giganteus"...a mythological deer who dance to keep the local river flowing.The animators don't miss a thing (or step). In fact in any scene where there is dancing they have been very precise with the steps and music. There is no "blur" of foot mobement...it's precise.I would be remiss if I didn't mention how grand and different the antlers on the "Megaloceros Giganteus" were. In our opinion this film rates just as high as any of the better films from Pixar, DreamWorks, Laika, or even Illumination Studios. This is one movie we would like to add to our collection. Hopefully River Productions and Sky Cinema will do another one."

I was really looking forward to watching this title. I should also point out that I'm Irish born and bred!! I had hoped to see something along the lines of the amazing Brown Bag studios titles such as Book of Kells, where the animation was amazing and the voice cast matched the local dialect and accents, however, this film failed. While a handful of the voices were Irish they were almost "hammed" Irish and then the rest of the voices were American or at least very American soumdong. This disappointed me greatly. I'm sure kids will enjoy it and it may spawn another rush of people wanting to learn "new" Irish dancing because this was not even close to what I spent 8 years suffering through during my primary school years. But with a more clinical and critical viewing this is by far not the best animated Irish story. I will say that through extreme screening of the animated characters danving almost all the steps look accurate even that of the dancing deer. On the whole I will be digging out my dvd copy of Riverdance the human version and enjoy that a billion times more."

The forced Irish accents (rolling the r's for some reason?) and the shoehorned attempts to be Irish (like the deers who are American for some reason playing hurling), leave a lot to be desired. Could've done so much more with this concept, instead it's exactly what you would expect an American's perspective of Ireland to be. Not for me."

I am Irish, (have an actual Irish accent) and I didn't notice any pretend Irish accents going on, I really don't get the reviews that mentioned forced Irish accents or brogue Irish..... no American actors were used as Irish characters in this film. Pierce Brosnan's accent has always been slightly unusual in that he slips in and out of Irish, English, and slightly American at times. Aisling Bea really does sound like that. Real Irish accents vary massively, and yes, some Irish people in rural Ireland still roll their R's. We have watched it a few times now, I suspect it will always be a family favourite. Inspired lots of dancing and helpful discussions around old age and death. Recommended."

I turned this on for her as she loves dancing, and she has been up dancing and completely mesmerised by the whole thing. Lots of great voice actors in this and the animation is lovely.We live in Ireland, and didn't have a problem with the diverse voice cast."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10841088/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," Adorable and entertaining ","My two boys (5 and 2) absolutely adore this movie. The music and dancing is so fun and the storyline is very sweet with humour added in. It also teaches about loss (my 5 year old is dealing with the loss of his grandad) and this was the perfect movie to give him some comfort.I'm not sure why there are so many negative reviews. It is meant to be a children's movie. It was very well done in my opinion with beautiful animation."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10841088/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," A good, modern interpretation for a younger audience ","As an Irish dancer for the majority of my teen years, I was excited to hear about and see this film.The story itself is obviously rewritten for a more modern, younger audience, but I believe it gets the job done at getting a younger generation interested in the art of Irish dance.There are a few fart and poop jokes that are pretty cringy to sit through, but the dance scenes and the classic soundtrack are really what makes this movie special.Would watch again."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10849722/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," Intervention ","A night of reckless drinking compels Ed, a car mechanic, to forcibly detox his best friend Charlie - no matter what the cost - in this film from Kirby Voss (who directed and co-wrote the movie with Felicia Stallard.As Charlie sleeps off last night's drinking, Ed goes through the home and pours out all of his alcohol. The reaction is worse than you'd expect, with Charlie hitting every target on his friend, even taking great pains to make fun of his sexual orientation.It doesn't get any better for Ed.Jarden Bankens (who was Darkness in Words on Bathroom Walls) as Ed and William McGovern as Charlie bring so much to this movie, which they have to, as they are the only characters on screen for most of its running time. You buy that they are friends at the same time you sense the hopelessness of their situation. The film uses its sound and split-screen views to repeatedly slam you in the face with the sheer pain of this intervention.This is a bleak film and may not be for everyone, but if you want to see an interesting take of addiction and mental health, this is for you."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10849722/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","3"," Friends ","This movie position as a thriller but indeed the should be a drama instead. Wrong positioning on the theme given audience wrong expectations."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10849722/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," Pretty Good ","This was quite raw. A close up look at an alcoholic's mania (and brain damage due to years of alcohol consumption) and how far friendship can go in saving a friend. Ill advised medically, but it made for a good story.The acting was very good; shows skill and dexterity. They need more opportunities in film; they deserve it. Cinematography and composition was excellent.The one MAJOR MAJOR MAJOR MAJOR fault is the christian nonsense that is filtered into it. Christians can't resist making nonbelievers look like they're messed up due to a lack of religion. Typical and that is why I gave the film only 5 stars. Normally I give manipulative christian movies a 1, but the rest of the attributes of the film were very good."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10849722/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," WHOA ","Didn't really think much from the poster and the two reviews on here, but this was good!Great direction from Kirby Voss and I quite like the use of split screen and flash cuts to give an uneasy feeling throughout. I didn't really enjoy the score or supporting cast.One of the more realistic performances I have seen, Jared Bankens owns the role of Charlie with brutal honesty. An actor to definitely watch out for. Will McGovern does a great job as Ed.Give it a try!"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10850940/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Throwback to 80s horror slashers ","What a blast Buzz Cut is! This has to be the most fun I've had in ages watching a movie, and it is indie horror at its finest. Hard to believe it took this long to get a proper kiwi slasher flick, and Buzz Cut is happy to fill that void. There are lots of nods to classic 80s slashers, and while some of the writing is not for the faint of heart (if you're easily offended it's best to avoid this one), it really does take you back to when slashers were in their prime. There's some great gory practical effects, and some really fantastic Kiwi humour. Buzz Cut is indie horror gold!"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10851100/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," Must watch pandemic movie ","I watched this in Maxus Mall and was overwhelmed with the story. Casting is very good and Brajesh Rai has done a wonderful job as the star of this movie. I recommend everyone to watch it as it portrays both passion and the pandemic tragedy very well."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10851100/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," Very Refreshing.. ","What a beautiful and totally new content. The movie was so refreshing. Also, a movie to be watched with entire family, as it has no vulgar scene or dialogue. This movies shows that still Good movies can be made."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10851100/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Nice one ","Nicely scripted. Its a quite good movie ,watch it with your family."
