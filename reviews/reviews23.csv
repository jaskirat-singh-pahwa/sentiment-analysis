I wonder how could something that looks like a collage of the travel clips be called a feature film and could be accepted by orgs that showcase it, films like this should be banned otherwise we will start film popping up by making a collage of the tik-tok or YouTube videos, it is a big shame brought to the feature films altogether.There were very few good frames in the film, I was awe-struck with the photography of this film and the way the forest/falls were portrayed in this film. But, that was it, nothing else to really watch out in the film but yeah you're looking for crooked content, then the crooked scenes might interest you as well. But, the way the film takes us through the journey is something that's not even comprehensible, when I think about it, it just doesn't make any sense, no connectivity at all b/w each & every scene, that's just awful, it is just a piece of crap.Also, this is the only film that I remember where the BGM spoiling the whole movie."

"," Review of Vaazhl, On SonyLIV: Arun Prabhu Packages A Crash Course In Enlightenment As An Entertaining Drama ","If director Arun Prabhu Purushothaman's last film, Aruvi, was concerned about social problems, Vaazhl explores the personal. Abruptly and in the middle of action, we meet Prakash (Pradeep) as he's drowning in a blue mass of water. He's fighting for life because his leg is stuck under a rock underwater. When we rewind to the beginning of his story, we see him in a blue-looking Chennai, stuck in a dreary IT job, dready relationship and a dreary family. Can he breathe freely again? But when you think you're going to get a message, Vaazhl gives you an idiosyncratic and well-crafted experience instead."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11444602/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Only if life is thaaat happening! - Daretoreadme ","Vaazhl (Live) narrates the story of a typical Indian youngster, living in the toxic Indian society, getting a 'life'.Life is defined by the film to be meaningful, if it involves 'traveling', but you know what? Traveling doesn't exist in many people's definition of happy living.That is, the idea of living, differs from person to person.For some, life has just to be simple where for others, it has to be peaceful. The idea of leaving one's home, troubles many. Traveling doesn't suit a lot of people.In the modern Indian film culture, we see a growing number of heroes, leaving their jobs, taking their bikes and wandering across the world, giving a cool perception, of the character's life.Not theirs.Hence, what the film 'Vaazhl''s advises can be utterly ridiculous to many. It's story, being surreal and overly fictional, might be bothering for some. I like Taramani kind of film, totally happening.Apart from the story of the film, technically praising, the cinematography was breath taking. I'll recommend the film if you are pleased by the beautiful visions of a film. The music was breezy, passing through the film, adding emotions to it.Small stories, which are pinned then and there in the film, narrated by using different aspect ratios are unique. The story telling was aruvi level. All the actors did their part convincingly. The director is surely one of the gems of Tamil cinema.Concluding, Vaazhl is for those, whose ideas of life correlate with the film and for those, who are impressed by the way a story is told, rather than the story itself. Practical people might not be able to cope up with the film.With a range of mixed emotions, Vetrri."

This film is exactly this and I thought it was gonna be the best film in this category until the start of the second half. Maybe the director went into a dilemma,a confused state as to where to take the film after the first half.. It all seemed confused.. I'll come back to the second half later.. I'll first talk about the excellency of the first half.. All the characters were well developed,the story moved well, atleast it had a point. The second half seemed like a tourism advertisement with a bunch of random though beautiful cinematic shots and the character Taniya lacked depth and seemed nowhere and entropical. The second half left me with a lot of unanswered questions. Maybe the director could have smoked the same weed as the first half and could have made it a masterpiece."

In the move, he travel to a foreign county with some good scenery for maybe 10 days and then it seems he is reformed? IT people can easily plan to take this short getaway easily every year.

Trip is probably one of the films that try much to be engaging as well as gripping but the poor writing drags down the film. The interesting factor falls down since the starting point and we are confused with the happenings in the film. Yogi Babu and Karunakaran are trying much to save the film with their hilarious performance but unfortunately, the film misuses them. Their comedies are somewhat tiring and don't bring much laughter. The other supporting actors including Sunainaa are left with nothing to perform.

If "one second" is an attempt to simplify the road, then "on the cliff" is its interesting control group. The relationship and motivation of the characters are complex, and there are foreshadows everywhere. If you miss a paragraph, it is easy to miss important information. More than 95% of the time is a string on the people's mind, The remaining five percent are composed of small humor that makes people laugh and warmth in troubled times. The two works show both sides of Zhang Yimou's character, calm restraint and compassion. Such creative vitality and acceptance of new themes are really admirable. The dawn after darkness is not necessarily the real dawn, but the glimmer in the darkness must be hot and sincere. There is room for the rise of spy war stories, and the one who breaks the ceiling is above the cliff."

I really enjoyed the strain and the thrill that the movie offered in Act 2 , but it took me some time to realize who's who and I had to carefully follow up on everybody's lines and subtext in Act 1 (even if I speak Mandarin). It also feels a bit abrupt when we see things are all settled in the end. Clarity is inevitably compromised when the narrative sometimes requires the audience to connect dots by themselves , in a blink of an eye."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11448076/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","2"," A Profoundly Awful Film... ","Cliff Walkers is a profoundly awful film. Ironically, it gets deserved high marks for being visually stunning. It has great art direction, clean editing, and the casting is good. But everything tragically stops there. The plot is impossibly convoluted and so utterly ridiculously and needlessly intricate that it leaves zero room for even basic character development. Every character is essentially moving through beautiful shots, mindlessly double-crossing everyone else. And then there is the dumb stuff... like all the spies are given poison pills, but only AFTER they have started the dangerous mission. First they parachute into snow-covered wilderness, and THEN they are standing in knee-high snow distributing tiny white pills. Meanwhile, the spies are supposedly under constant direct surveillance by enemy agents, and yet repeatedly they escape various gun battles and knife fights. Lots of bullets fly and blood is drawn, but nobody important in the story dies from actually being shot in a gun battle, even if this could possibly advance the plot,and be... ya know... realistic... it's a spy cartoon masquerading as a serious film. And since everyone wears the same stylish black, and nobody is telling the truth, it's impossible to say who is working for whom. Some people will blame the impenetrable anti-plot on CCP (Chinese government) story censors. But don't kid yourself. There are MANY good films made in China in spite of CCP censors. This movie is NOT one of them. It's a sad tragic waste, a melodramatic empty vessel, a hollow gesture to the sacred honor of the subject it purports to idealize (the fight against WWII fascism). The blame for this film's utter failure rests squarely on the director and writer... and especially the producers who should have insisted on a script re-write. Don't waste your time on this movie."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11448076/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," Also called "Cliff Walkers" ","A film based on a TV series - XuanYa (Cliff). I think the meaning is quite obvious, considering it tells a story of special agents. Directed by Zhang Yimou, with a crew full of powerful actors. Especially Yu Hewei, for the character Zhou Yi. I cannot tell too much, otherwise it'd be spoiled, but his acting definitely reached to the master level in this film. He does have 20 some years of acting experiences with multi-direction roles.The film was well made, intense plots, beautiful scenes, unexpected twists, perfect lines and intricate emotions. Every actor was on their best state with the cameras filming to its precision. It was no more no less.I cannot praise it enough. Please go and watch!"

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11448490/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Intriguing Home Invasion Epic ","There is more than meets the eye to writer & director Shane Dax Taylor's fourth film "Masquerade," an implausible pastiche of suspense and horror movie tropes toplining Bella Thorne. This unrated, slow-burn, 77-minute charade starts out like a home invasion thriller and then ends up being all about revenge. If you love to talk back to your movies, you may find yourself doing a lot of talking back to "Masquerade." Initially, certain things don't appear to add up. Actually, they do not add up! If the deceptive narrative dupes you, you may be offering foolish advice to some characters. For example, you'll want to warn the little girl to "watch out" when she need not. Later, when the married couple enter their home, secluded in the wilderness, they concentrate on finding flashlights and checking circuit breaker fuse boxes. You'd think they would check up on their daughter first? Observant viewers will spot these inconsistencies and realize "Masquerade" amounts to more than a straightforward, low-budget, crime thriller. Shane Dax Taylor isn't opposed to dazzling us with an occasional surprise before the astonishing revelation at fadeout. Some will scratch their heads in bewilderment, while others will snap their fingers because they put everything together. This entertaining, low-wattage thriller suffers from its ponderous pace. Rome was built faster than our pint-sized heroine can thumb cartridges into a six-shot, snub-nosed revolver, with the cylinder hanging out of the frame on a hinge. Taylor knows how to get mileage out of the smallest actions. Shrewdly, he doesn't take on more than he can handle, and "Masquerade" boasts an unforgettable finale. Nevertheless, "Masquerade" still seems infuriatingly slow at times.Basically, "Masquerade" crosscuts between two stories. Moreover, these stories aren't concurrent as some may believe. In storyline # 1, we have a successful, upscale, thirtysomething, married couple--art brokers Daniel (Austin Nichols of "The Iron Orchard") and Olivia (Mircea Monroe of "Cellular")--who have thrown a masquerade party for charity at a liquor distillery. Appropriately, the guests all wore masks. Afterward, Daniel and Olivia were sloshed enough to realize somebody else must take them home. One of their event servers, Rose (Bella Thorne of "Assassination Nation"), offers them a lift. Like an Uber driver, she requests to be compensated for her efforts. She learns the couple live thirty minutes from the distillery. Meantime, in storyline # 2, a pair of burglars break into a sprawling estate somewhere in the boondocks. A high fence surrounds the house, and a home security system monitors the premises. Before they cut the power to the house, the intruders disable the security alarm system. The male thief dismantles the valuable paintings, rolls them up, and stashes them in separate tubes. His female accomplice has trouble catching a reluctant 11-year-old girl, Casey (Alyvia Alyn Lind of "Mockingbird"), who keeps outsmarting her. One big surprise in "Masquerade" is that Casey cannot outsmart destiny. Not only does she sprain her ankle when she plunges through the ceiling from the attic, but she is also shot once in the belly with her own revolver! Of course, women sprain their ankles all the time in movies. Not as many have their guns confiscated and then wounded with their own hardware. This brave little darling teeters on a tightrope between life and death. "Masquerade" wins brownie points for making everything a hurdle for our heroine.No sooner have the burglars broken into Casey's house than they murder our heroine's harmless babysitter. "Masquerade" indulges itself in blood and gore. The only thing comparable occurs when Casey shoots a woman in the eye and blood doesn't splatter everything. These burglars wear sinister black outfits with gloves. Fencing helmets hide their facial features, and voice converters make them sound like Darth Vader. The pugnacious male burglar kills Sophia (newcomer Ana Rodas) with a ball hammer. Afterward, he keeps on beating her brains out. Predictably, Taylor provides only a glimpse or two of this horrific violence. Later, another man is stabbed repeatedly in the belly, and he drools blood with little prospect of surviving the night. This is about as violent as things get, and it happens quickly as well as in the dark. Thrillers like "Masquerade" add a twist to virtually everything, and this makes them such diverting fare. Furthermore, this kind of movie is like a mystery. Once you know what has happened, you can go back and figure out what you might have missed the first time. Any movie that gets you to watch it more than once qualifies as above average or a movie whose arabesques must be fathomed to appreciate its artistry. If you enjoy cinematic head games, "Masquerade" was made for you."

It has unpredictable end, it is mysterious, and it explains everything at the end, although bit too unclear or complicated.

The actors have neither the skill nor the apparent inclination to give the audience much of anything. Admittedly, their uninspired lines are a major impediment.The reveal during the third act is so badly rendered, it had me shaking my head.

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11448490/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","1"," possibly the worst ","Okay so the message of this movie is if someone harms you it means you can go for revenge. Two wrongs make a right. And do deal with death the first natural instinct is to steal art...That is what this movie is. One long "you stole from my family so me killing and torturing yours is okay"The movie is so dumb. Like actual dumb. It makes The Purge look like a Harold Pinter play.Acting ranges from AmDram to Uni quality with barely a handful of scenes where the acting is anything other than budget. The worst actor happens to be the lead... Somehow... Ironically she has a more dynamic range when wearing a fencing mask...But the plotholes are massive:Backgground checks... When working with art in the UK you have a CRB check. In the US you also need social number. Add that to the fact that what happened to "rose" was in the news and massive...The other problem is art is rarely stolen. Forged, yes. A lot. But stolen? Its not impossible to steal a painting but it is impossible to sell one. If you find a buyer they cant authenticate it nor insure it... A stolen painting is worthless. That is why criminals go for the much harder to steal and heavier to move gold and diamonds.That is why the Hatton Garden Heist was a thing, and a group of women have stolen from the royal mint yet nobody has ever stolen a painting from the Tate, BMA or Manchester Lowry.This is before we get into the whole idea that people traumatised from violence become violent... Erm... No. PTSD actually more manifests as jumping, crying and panic attacks...Im not marking this as spoilers cause the "twist" is obvious within the first few scenes (if you hadn't worked it all out by the restroom scene where she even says "I wanna have what you have" cause the writers are so pretentious they think that such a line shows intellectual foreshadowing. It doesn't. It's cringe. And way obvious.Knew from the start she was a "bad guy" and that the film at the end would try to say "she is really just a victim of blah blah blah" ... And I am sure in the creators head if Hitler had been in a camp when a child it would justify the holocaust... It doesn't. Nobody with a rational mind would think that. The same way as nobody accepts when a child abuser uses the fact they were abused as an excuse.I have been robbed in the street, and beaten up. I got told if I wasn't quite they would use the weapons they had. Afterwards I went to the police and have gone back to my normal life, albeit a little anxious about going out at night on my own. It certainly didn't turn me into one of them.This movie feels like some psycho idiots wet dream. I am guessing the writer got robbed and this is their fantasy... Cause they sure seem healthy... Huh.Also quick question: at 53 mins she goes into a bedroom and clearly there is power - an outlet is literally lit up. Right of the screen. That red dot. So when the power is cut in the USA that means wall outlets are still powered? I am guessing someone left their vape batteries on charge. Or something else hollywood preppy.Also to the review above about Daybreak and Alicia... she is such a bad actress...Literally another blonde haired blue eyed nothing to blend in with the literal millions of others... I mean how many are there? I mean do we need this many? The only one worth a damn is Caity Lotz. But from the dumb bint that plays Stargirl all the way up to Margot Robbie... Do we need them? They are the same actress...This movie is the epitome of leftist LA: Bland, lacking depth, lacking cohesion or logic, lacking structure and lacking any merit... But it looks good and everyone is attractive and not one person is overweight... But but but but Wahmen is main star, wahmen is bad guy and the two male characters are non entities... LOL. The left is so fake. It cries about not enough black people winning oscars whilst we still wait for someone from Bollywood, the worlds biggest producer of movies, to even get a nod. Or like how long it took for non US animations to win anything with the likes of Le Triplets De Bellville and Spirited Away. To think that Ghost in the Shell, Akira, etc have won nothing... Meanwhile Titanic, the worlds most hated movie (well in the UK it's been voted the worst 10 years running) is also one of the most award winning along with awful "lets rip off dances with wolves" Avatar.As Ricky Gervais pointed out... Hollywood still has a lot to answer for whilst it preaches to us... Epstein and Weinstein was all of your friends, not the movie going public."

Still can't understand why wearing a mesh fencing mask somehow makes you sound like a cross between Darth Vader and Lord Humongous from Mad Max 2... As for the plot, it's dreadful. Having been told he has '37 minutes' to remove all the artwork from the house before they return, we then have to watch the worlds slowest burglary. Firstly he moves the body of the babysitter he'd battered to death. For what reason? The floor is still covered in blood, now with extra drag marks!Then we have to watch as he sets out a full tool kit, making sure each tool is lined up perfectly. Then gets out ANOTHER tool roll, only to select a file from the first one. He could have kept that in his pocket... A file?... to cut a canvas from its frame? If this wasn't bad enough we have to watch him go through the same ridiculous charade for the next painting! No rush mate, you sort your tools out.The daughter, Casey, finds the perfect hiding place in the attic where she sits and hides, and could have stayed there unseen all night. But no, for no reason at all, she decides to do a balancing act along the rafters, predictably falling through the ceiling.None of it makes sense. Was the plan just a burglary? In which case why didn't they get in and out as quickly as possible, or was it revenge and the intention was to kill them all anyway. If that was the case, why the charade of 'stalling' the home owners return to give the burglars more time? The whole film was ridiculous, and quite frankly painful to watch.If you removed the pointless tool bag scenes, and the endless scenes of burglars looking for the girl under beds and in cupboards, the film would have a runtime of about ten minutes."

Horror director and writer Mickey Keating adds to his oeuvre with a creative twist on the genre that mixes zombies, the depths of hell, and a powerful monster. Using title cards to take us through six chapters and an Epilogue, Mr. Keating has us experience the events through the eyes of Marie Aldrich (played by Jocelin Donahue). However, it's Marie's mother Ava, played by the always interesting Melora Walters (whose career dates back to DEAD POETS SOCIETY, 1989), whom we see and hear from first. She appears near death as she explains that she's accepted that there is no way to run away from nightmares ... they always find you.Marie receives a letter informing her that her mother's grave has been desecrated and it's an urgent matter that must be handled promptly and without fanfare (do people usually go to the press on such matters?). Marie and her boyfriend George (Joe Swanberg) head to the island where Mom is buried. It's a creepy place that shuts down for the winter. Marie's mother had told her stories of the island and "The Man from the Sea", and how the island residents sold their soul to the sea monster in order to survive the harsh conditions. Reluctantly, the Bridge Man (Richard Brake) allows them to cross the bridge onto the island.Things immediately seem weird and off-center. Marie finds her mother's damaged grave, but the caretaker is nowhere to be found. Under a time crunch, Marie and George make some bad decisions ... of course, it wouldn't be a horror movie without bad decisions! Not to give away any of the fun, but suffice to say the island is cursed, just as Marie's mom had warned.Keating creates some nice visuals, and has terrific placement of The Vogues' "Turn Around, Look at Me". One thing that I couldn't help but notice is that Marie runs and runs. She runs a lot. I'm hoping Ms. Donahue agreed to the extra miles before arriving on set. There are enough chills here to keep us engaged, and Keating deserves credit for an original story within a genre that frequently re-treads."

"," Helmet, On ZEE5, Is A Flavourless And Familiar Social Dramedy ","Nearly ten years after model-actor John Abraham turned producer with the landscape-shaping Vicky Donor starring Ayushmann Khurrana, model-actor Dino Morea has turned producer with its tired and formulaic sibling, Helmet, starring brother Aparshakti Khurana. The heritage is obvious - too obvious. Helmet is the kind of derivative, half-hearted and generic North Indian social dramedy that makes you want to pat its head and politely send it back to school. For no fault of its own (other than being great), Vicky Donor has spawned a legacy of pretenders over the years. Like a creepy game of Chinese Whispers, every subsequent iteration seems to retain less and less of the truth and novelty of the original. While sex was still a conversation starter back in the Hindi cinema of 2012, it's now a full-blown Bollywood hashtag. The innuendos are the same, the puns are dated, the "quirky" characters are not so quirky anymore, and the moral posturing feels about as genuine as a Spring day in Mumbai.Read the full review on Film Companion."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11460818/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," The Movie Perfectly Delivers The Social Message With A Good Dose Of Humour !!! ","Even today, majority of people in India are hesitant to buy Condoms from stores, and others are embarrassed to even utter the word. But is it possible to make a film around this subject? Turns out, it is. Helmed by Satram Ramani, this satire openly discusses the use of 'NIRODH' (contraceptives) and the social and psychological challenges that come with it.Set in the small town of Kanpur, 'Helmet' revolves around the story of Lucky (Aparshakti Khurana), a wedding performer who dreams of opening his own wedding band and marrying his crush, Rupali (Pranutan Bahl), a flower decorator at weddings. But they can't be together because Rupali comes from an affluent family and Lucky struggles to make ends meet. Desperate to make some quick money to fulfill his desires, Lucky conspires with his friends-Sultan (Abhishek Banerjee) and Minus (Ashish Verma)-to rob the goods truck of an e-commerce portal. But to their surprise, the looted boxes contain condoms instead of electronic gadgets. What will Lucky's next move be?Satramm Ramani's direction and Rohan Shankar's screenplay are equally interesting throughout, and the film humourously addresses the serious subject of Indian men's aversion to contraception, which eventually leads to population surge. The film gradually unfolds by focussing solely on Lucky's love story, but quickly picks up steam when Lucky loots a truck and the never-ending fun begins. The most amusing scenes are when he starts a company called 'Helmet' and tries to sell condoms to the medical store owner, Shambhu (Saanand Verma), and to the general public. The film has plenty of laugh-out-loud moments that you could hold on to, but what's problematic is the length and the way the story rang towards the end.He dialogues by Rohan Shankar, especially the one-liners like, "Shaadi ke liye paise chahiye the, shaadi ke baad ka quota nahi," and the way Aparshakti delivers them with a straight face, makes you chuckle. Shubham Shirule and Ana Rehman's (JAMB) song 'Mauka Mauka' and Tony Kakkar's 'Band Baj Gaya' are upbeat tracks that stay with you long after the movie is over. The background score by Ketan Sodha perfectly complements the tone of the film, and the 'Mauka Mauka' theme is used effectively in intervals.After a string of supporting roles, Aparshakti Khurrana impresses in this solo leading act. His comic timing is top-notch and can be considered as one of the veritable highlights of the film. Abhishek Banerjee and Ashish Verma as friends, offer good comedy punches too. Pranutan Bahl convincingly portrays a caring and supportive girlfriend.As the film's compelling screenplay emphasises, "Chahiye sabko magar maangna kisi ko nahi hain (everyone wants it but is hesitant to ask for it)," this is an important issue that are more often been overlooked but needs to be addressed. To summarise, the quirky comedy tops with defined performances and relevant social message make this film a good watch."

No doubt a reasonably well made film with quite a few comic situations and gags interspersed at periodic intervals. The title is very appropriate too. The film is a parody. It has satire, gags and wit.Ayushmann's brother Aparshakti makes the best of the overdue lead role of a simpleton Lucky forced to sell a large number of condoms to make money enough to get married to lady love Pranutan whose father is unwilling. His two friends helping out are Sultan played by Abhishek Banerjee (equally desperate for money to save his poultry business) and a half wit, half deaf guy Minus played by Ashish Mehra ( the moron who messes things up). Sharib Hashmi convincingly plays the sex disease inflicted gangster Bunty who wants his money back.Director Satram Ramani has done a good job. The movie tries to rake up issues of unsafe sex by including scenes of sex workers, their problems and their helplessness. Set in hinterland India, the movie will easily connect with the audience due to credible situations and local flavour of the dialogue. Mercifully the situations are kept light and are not boring. The dialogue sustains the comedy well."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11460818/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Great story! Poor execution ","Helmet comes with a story that every indian household should hear about condoms and how people should not be ashamed of using it.However, the execution is very poor. The entire plot of robbery and selling condoms gets too unconvincing. In the middle, the film gets too monotonous. Humor however is decent ! This guy named Minus brings in the maximum laughs. Aparshakti Khurana is decent but nothing too great as a lead. Abhishek too is decent. Pranutan along with the favorite family man guy Sharib Hashmi is completely wasted.Overall, a decent one time watch film which should be watched with low expectations."

The makers have taken this national problem and made a movie out of it. It was such a promising plot but Satram Ramani has not capitulated on the script. Yes there are some really funny moments but a good portion of the movie was predictable and straightforward. Even the ending could've been tighter.We finally get to see Aparshakti Khurana in a lead role and he has done a good job. Pranutan Bahl was also good in her limited role. What works for the movie is the great supporting cast especially Abhishek Banerjee and Ashish Verma. Just hope to see them in more projects.Watch it if you have nothing to do this weekend."

In a country where people feel shy with word Condom, the writer create a world where people can overcome this fear. It may be expected sometime but the ideas of selling condoms were quite good and very well done.Director Satram Ramani did a good job. He keeps the film interesting and keep the idea of social awareness intact. His direction is simple. There wasn't much surprising elements but still he make it a enjoyable movie.The overall acting is good but there was no standout performance. The actors try to do their job and it kept the movie at the bay. If one or 2 characters could be performed brilliantly then Helmet could be a outstanding movie.The only drawback in the film was its end.

LE GOUT DE LA HAINE - French release title - Sidney Lumet's shadow and spirit seems to be in both films. A radical critism of the human world and society, thru networks for instance. Gloomy, depressing but so close to reality."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11460976/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Tense atmosphere and great acting makes the movie despite its lack of a deeper message ","In "Prime Time" the young Sebastian (Bartosz Bielenia) wants his 15 minutes of fame and glory by taking over a TV station to deliver a message to Polish people on New Year's Eve 1999. As hostages he takes over the TV host Mira (Magdalena Poplawska) and the assistant Grzegorz (Andrzej Klak). Tension arises when the police is called and the armed man is eager with his plan of delivering his message to the point of threats to kill everyone.Interesting premise with great thrilling moments, "Prime Time" may alienate viewers who expect a more elaborated storyline. The intensity of the man's action gets on the way of finding out what's the message this troubled young man wants to give. And it's thanks to the great Bartosz Bielenia, from the amazing "Corpus Christi" that the movie finds some soul and interest. He's an intense and interesting character who struggles with his problems of speech but he's under control over the situation at the TV station leaving everybody nervous all around. To me, since he doesn't give any reasoning for his actions, we are led to believe it was just a rebelious acts to show how unprepared the police system is in giving a proper response to a hostage situation where he can toy those guys around for hours and get the TV people putting him live with a loaded gun.Sure, it's obvious one wants to expect more from "Prime Time" but the best you're gonna get is the tension and thrills of the story, going from the hostage situation to the people in the booth control trying to solve the situation. The ultimate conclusion one can get from here it's a story about a troubled young man desperate for attention and that's the only way he can get from people. With a more proper message to leave us in more suspense than the usual thriller routine, this movie would be perfect. I liked it and I don't think it goes to waste but I can understand why it may upset more demanding viewers. The editing is fine, the rhythm is adequate and balanced, and there's even some room for dark humor. The acting makes a more than decent experience. Worth of view. 7/10."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11460976/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," A Boring, Flat and Completely Pointless Hostage Thriller ","Prime Time honestly would've worked out better as a short film. Actually to be blunt, Prime Time is a pointless waste of time.So the main reason this Polish thriller is utterly worthless is just because of how stretched out it is. Without giving out actual spoilers, the film is all just about a man who interrupts live TV, threatens the crew with a gun, and demands to talk on live air. It is a very weird, very unusual, but a smart idea that wasted it's opportunity. You can seriously just watch the trailer and say you've basically seen the movie.The film's only upside is the lead performance, in which is thrilling enough to hold you through. It probably would've been great if it was a short film with a 15 minute runtime, as the rest is just unnecessary, flat and boring dread.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11460976/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," An antithriller ","SummaryPrime Time is a film about a lost and desperate young man who wants to massively transmit a message in the pre-social media era and must be evaluated as a disenchanted drama and not as a thriller.ReviewAn armed young man breaks into a Polish television studio during the broadcast of a program on New Years Eve 1999 and takes his host and a security guard hostage with the demand to read a message live.I believe that Jakub Piatek's film should not be seen as a thriller but as a drama and even as an antithriller. The wrong gender assignment will be a source of misjudgment and will frustrate those who see it with thriller expectations. And this is clearly the risk that its director takes and the challenge that it poses to the viewer. On the other hand, the Piatek most successfully doses the implicit theatricality of his proposal, resulting from filming in almost a single stage space a story that also takes place in real time, without ellipsis.Sebastian (Bartosz Bielenia) is an anonymous young man, between disenchanted and desperate, who wants to make himself heard in a very special historical moment or who lives as special. He must negotiate with the unexpected bureaucracy of the television station and with the erratic behavior of the security forces. Meanwhile, the monitors offer a mosaic of the expectations and demands of Poles in the face of the new millennium. What will Sebastian's message be?In retrospect, it is interesting to note that we are in a pre-social media era and the only way for an outsider to make themselves heard was to break into TV.Prime Time is a sad drama without heroes, which does not follow the rules of dramatic progression of the thriller but the ups and downs of reality, where everyone does what they can and how they can while we wait for the reading of poor Sebastian's message, in a movie that is locates in our point of view, preserving its necessary anonymity."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11460976/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Entertaining ","It works as entertainment and manages to offer quality in the performance.Although the plot lengthens during the film, it manages to be entertaining. Highlights include the good performances from the entire cast, excellent production design, good photography, good directing, and compelling makeup. On the other hand, the script is not its greatest strength, it does not explain why that happens, there is no development of some characters and others end up discarding them. I feel like there is a message behind it, but it can't be made known.I like how they apply psychology to the main character, it describes why it is like that but it does not describe why he is doing it, something that you expect throughout the film, although it manages to entertain and to stand out in the technical aspects."

Stop reading now if you want to have a go at figuring ot out for yourself!..........About half way through, Sebastian asked the negotiator what would happen to him according to the law. The negotiator explains if he hurts the hostages he's looking at 5-20 years but if he let's them go he won't be charged and will walk free. Fast forward a bit and his demands to have the cameras turned on to make his statement are finally met and the cameras are switched on and begin to record. He then supposedly bottles it and can't make his speech. Later he apparently tries to kill himself but the gun isn't loaded! The police then force their way in and beat him. Someone in the crew says something along the lines of "we got that on tape" and the director then pulls the tape from the machine and slips it into her bag.He therefore did make his statement on camera although he did want it to be broadcast live as he didn't know someone (the director) would help him and hide the tape. The point he was making was no matter his innocence in the eyes if the law, the police don't care and will do what they want and beat an innocent man.Closing credits featured "Freed from desire" by Gala. I thought this summed up the feel of thr film perfectly."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11460976/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," The elegy of the insignificance ","The endless sadness of the film, especially the last scene, is perhaps only understandable in the eastern half of Europe. Here, where it always seems that something can be carried through - if not otherwise, then at least with the impulse of ultimate despair, in the face of the world's indifferent gaze. Here, where this effort, driven by lethargy, always ends in disappointment. This infinitely disappointed gaze sheds new light on Stockholm syndrome: the kindness of the hostage-taker is not enough, because kindnesses are permanently detached from their own context and lose their meaning. As our leaders waste our time with their protocolary acts, as our own indecisiveness degrades our big moments into filler, as empty smiles underscore our own insignificance... It all makes it so important that at least someone, at least that one damn hostage-taker, really needs us. Really. Us."

The bulk of climatic moments disappointed. From a social/emotional standpoint, after waiting until the near end, we never got to hear the critical message to the public which would have provided both personal satisfaction and social insight.

That would also explain why he has so compliant at the end of the film??

The directors of this film could have taken this in a great direction, this film could have had amazing potential. There have been a stream of great chimp-based spy films and television shows, including "Lancelot Link", "Spymate", and others. But this film, unfortunately, appears to have taken more after the film "Funky Monkey", which is the worst film I have ever watched. Now this film does not bring out the murderous rage that "Funky Monkey" did, but the CGI chimp coupled with the extremely mediocre, pro-interventionist plot make this film extremely dissapointing.

Ravikumar or Petta villain) in that character as it'd have amplified the role as a whole and also the dialogues/convo b/w the pro/antagonist could've been bettered up to give even more amplification.

"," Kabadadaari, With Sibi Sathyaraj And Nandita Swetha: This Investigative Thriller Is Focussed, But Also Flat And Flavourless ","Pradeep Krishnamoorthy's Kabadadaari is based on Hemanth Rao's 2019 Kannada feature Kavaludaari, and in terms of plot and structure, it stays fairly close to the source material. Sibi Sathyaraj plays a traffic cop named Sakthi. He wants to do more. He wants to be a detective. And he gets his chance (unofficially) when three skeletons are discovered in the earth being dug up for Metro Rail construction work. From my review of Kavaludaari: "A small boy, presumably the child of one of the workers, is playing with a ball. The ball bounces into a trench, and the boy follows, stepping carefully on the loose sand on the walls of the trench. The crux of this moment is the discovery of the skeletons - it's what sets the plot in motion, and you'd think this is where the big drama will play out." The boy will see the bones. The soundtrack will seize the opportunity and go ballistic."

"," Good mystery let down by lacklustre execution ","Kabadadari is among many engrossing mysteries (like Thegidi for instance) that has a great core but is let down by lacklustre filmmaking. The film as a whole works because of the story but at the same time doesn't because of a dull execution.Should you watch it? Yes! It's an interesting murder mystery. The murder(s) in question were committed 40 years prior to the film's setting. So, prepare for some grossly tinted sepia tones, big hairdos and a lot of facial hair (be it past or present). The first 2 hours were interesting. The last 30 minutes was a drag. I wonder if the antagonist's flashback could have been sizably edited.Mild spoilers ahead.... Speaking of editing... Praveen KL's work on the film is good in the earlier portions but there are these jump cuts (especially involving entering, starting and exiting cars) that put me off. I'm a fan of jump cuts. We all have our favourite Godard jump cut (mine is Seberg in the car in A Bout de Souffle) but cutting a second or two out of the process of getting in and out of the car doesn't make sense. You could cut that whole action out and it'll not be any different. When I talk about dull execution, it's these portions. Setting up a shot of them getting inside the car could help make this transition look more organic and in a word, better. If you're looking to trim the runtime, you could've cut out the so-called "item song" which was already trimmed. You could have taken the remaining minutes. You could have trimmed the overlong investigation where Sibiraj looks into a ledger and then stares right at us. It was hilarious and corny. You could have cut out the scenes where Abhishek plays the annoying supervisor who chides Sibiraj for dreaming big and flunking in a test. So many possibilities!The item song mentioned earlier serves as an introduction to a supporting character (played by Suman Ranganath). The initial setup makes it easy to predict that the character is going to end up dead very soon. Her death is announced by a morning telecast which shows the actress in a pool of blood with a bindi on her forehead that's made from blood. She's been shot in the head and all we see is a small coin-shaped patch of blood - right in the center of her head. This scene irked me a lot. Why do head shots always hit the center of the forehead? Why can't you go a little to the right or to the left. Why always in the center? There are so many questions you'd like to ask the filmmakers and yet, you know that you'll never get a proper answer."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11468156/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Kabadadaari is a decent crime thriller with some surprising twists ","Pradeep Krishnamoorthy's Kabadadaari is the official remake of the Kannada film Kavaludaari. We have seen many crime thrillers in Tamil and Kabadadhaari is definitely one among them. Kabadadaari is a thrilling film that wasn't made in the usual commercial format. We don't have unnecessary romance, dance numbers or even, superhero kind heroism which is refreshing. There's a certain uniqueness in the narrative pattern which works at moments. The interesting plot points that derive from the original film seem to have their proper place in this one too. It actually works at times and gives us a certain excitement during the narrative but it wasn't effective which is a major letdown in this film. Kabadadaari doesn't connect us with the characters. We are not able to feel their emotions or to understand their mindset because we don't have the much-needed emotional connectivity. There are few emotional scenes that are not strong enough to make us feel for it. Despite having strong performers, we don't get the effectiveness or the connectivity needed which is slightly disappointing. Sibi Sathyaraj is playing the role of Shakthi, a traffic constable who is stepping into a very old crime case without his higher official's permission. Sibi Sathyaraj fits well in this role and performs with his given space. Nassar plays a pivotal role and his performance is definitely helping the film to be more interesting. Jayaprakash dons another justifying pivotal role. Kabadadaari might fall prey to a middling screenplay but it's lifted by the brilliant background score of Simon K. King. After creating a pulsating background score in Kolaigaran, he is the one who drives the film effortlessly. His background score keeps us thrilled in the suspenseful moments. Speaking about Director Pradeep Krishnamoorthy, he has done purely justice to the content. The flaws that keep us away from the narrative could have been well done but honestly, Pradeep has made a film that would make your time. Overall, Kabadadaari is a decent crime thriller with some surprising twists."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11468156/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Good crime thriller movie ","Movie travels from the perspective of Sibi right from the word go. It starts with lots of open questions, which are answered in the last 30 minutes of the movie, which means screenplay is very good. Still somehow feeling like movie is better suited for OTT than theatres, not sure why. There are only three prominent characters in the movie and they are Sibi, Nasser & Jayaprakash. With Jayaprakash, whatever character is given to him, he excels in that. Superb acting by both Sibi & Jayaprakash."

It's a dreamlike 73-minutes that seems like you're part of the lucid dreamworld of its hero, going along for the ride as he escapes reality and enters something and somewhere different.This film transcends its small budget to tell a story that's different than anything else you'll see this year."

From a visual standpoint, you can pause Finding Ophelia at any point and it would be like having a work of art displayed on your screen. The film very much evokes and approximates the feeling of an altered, hypnotic state and yes, falling in love. I enjoyed the premise of the young man- played by the talented Jimmy Levar -being drawn to a mysterious girl he's never met and the way his visions were manifesting into reality. I was not expecting the ending! The production value is impressive and the kinetic camerawork didn't bother me the way clumsily handheld footage in other movies does at times. The storytelling may challenge less sophisticated viewers who are impatient and not accustomed to independent arthouse films but I believe it will find it's audience; it may even have cult-following potential. I highly recommend this film for those who appreciate both film and art and I will definitely watch this one again."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11469636/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," A moving fantasy anchored by solid performances! ","Stephen Rutterford's Finding Ophelia (2021) is a story of obsession and the bizarre as one man finds himself sucked into a reality bending trip in the pursuit of a mysterious and sultry woman.By far the most striking aspect about Finding Ophelia are its hypnotic visuals that convey the ethereal aspects of the story through a masterful use of color and motion. The two leads, Jimmy Levar and Christina Chu-Ryan, settle into their roles nicely and illustrate commendable lead performances that elevate the story. Rutterford's direction is commendable as well as he successfully manages to balance the reality and fantasy aspects of the narrative and crafts a potent fantasy horror in doing so.With crisp cinematography and great sound editing, Finding Ophelia manages to blur the line between fantasy and reality, leading to an engrossing mind bending odyssey. The film not only manages to impress through its technical and narrative aspects alone but is a great debut by first time director Stephen Rutterford. In short, the film is a trip worth taking for its visual aspects alone."

When he is forced to choose between his career, his relationships, and his romantic obsession with a mysterious woman, his life is thrown into disarray. Doing whatever it takes to find her leads William down a strange, dark path of signs and wonders, and he quickly learns that seeking the girl of your dreams can be a nightmare for him.Other theories emerge as writer-director Stephen Rutterford's story progresses, all of which involve a lovely woman (Christina Chu) who hovers above the ocean . In any case, William is deeply fascinated with her and believes that her appearance in his dreams is a sign. This sends him on a wonderful mystery tour through an urban wasteland filled with taunting pigs, dancing caterpillars, and frothing people.Ophelia is a character in William Shakespeare's drama Hamlet. In Hamlet, Ophelia represents femininity.The movie uses oneiric structure for the screenplay. Oneiric Structure is a one-of-a-kind screenplay structure that tells a story using dream-like images while also diving into the structure of dreams, memories, and human mind. As the film progresses, the distinction between the actual world and the dream world becomes increasingly hazy. We don't know what's true and what's not.The filmmakers use the oneiric aspect to create bizarre and otherworldly effects in their masterpieces. Male actors are the most prevalent leading dramatis personae in oneiric flicks. The character's embodiment is marked by narratives in which he enacts a pattern of desire that includes stimulating, erontic, and affectionate deeds. Scenes in oneiric films are depicted as if the characters are present in a real world. The conclusion of these flicks, on the other hand, reveals that everything was actually unfolding around a dream.The music choices are great which gives the intensity of dreams. The performances from the Jimmy Levar and Christina Chu are pretty strong for such a dream-like film. One of the best part of the movie is it's colour grading, which is astonishing.This mystery is very well made, with convincing acting and has a plot that the viewer will want to follow."
