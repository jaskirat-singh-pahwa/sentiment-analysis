"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10635042/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Solid enough adaptation of the Dream arc of Sailor Moon, but this film duology feels like it would've worked better in TV format. ","Following the defeat of the Death Busters, Usagi and Mamoru prepare to send their daughter Chibi-Usa back to the 30th century. When Chibi-Usa's departure is delayed due to a lunar eclipse, the trio decide to view it for themselves and catch a glimpse of something coming out of the eclipse followed by appearances of a talking Pegasus who pleads for their help. The arrival of the mysterious Dead Moon Circus soon brings with it phenomenon based around nightmares and the Sailor Guardians soon find themselves up against a new enemy.Following Season three of Sailor Moon Crystal which covered the Death Busters arc, it was announced one year afterwards that a fourth season covering the Dream arc would be produced with the announcement later stating the arc would be presented in a two part theatrically released film making it the first such theatrically released Sailor Moon property since 1995's Sailor Moon SuperS: The 9 Sailor Soldiers Unite! Miracle of the Black Dream Hole! (Think there's enough words in that title?). The films were picked up for international distribution by Netflix continuing with the same dub cast as previous Sailor Moon Crystal installments, and most of the characters of the Dream arc voiced by the same dub actors who played them in the redub of Sailor Moon Super S (with the exception of Helios). The series has received mostly positive reviews from both critics and fans, and having watched both the Super S adaptation as well as this adaptation, I can say Sailor Moon Eternal continues Sailor Moon Crystal's streak of taking the foundation arcs and offering a different experience on the material, but at the same time I really have to question why it was necessary to put this arc in two films rather than letting it play in TV format.Unlike previous Sailor Moon films such as Sailor Moon R: The Promise of a Rose or Sailor Moon S: Hearts in Ice that are designed to be self-contained stories with your "beginning, middle and end", Sailor Moon Eternal are not films for those who haven't seen the previous three seasons of Sailor Moon Crystal as Eternal directly follows on from the cliffhanger ending of Season Three and expects you to be familiar with prior events. While The Promise of a Rose or Hearts in Ice acknowledged developments or characters from the series continuity, the storylines were specifically designed as jumping on points to the series for the uninitiated so it made sense for them to be feature films as they allowed established fans to revisit characters in one off adventures and also served as jumping on points for the those unfamiliar with the franchise. While it's not unheard of for something like a TV series to get a theatrical film treatment, it's rare you have one that's a direct follow on to a series with three seasons worth of material its expecting the audience to be familiar with.In terms of how Eternal approaches the Dream arc, much like the other three seasons of Crystal it does it well, but it doesn't feel like it's designed in mind for film format and feels like several TV episodes joined end to end and presented as a feature film (sort of like compilation films done for the likes of Guren Lagann or Madoka Magica films). The Dream arc covers 11 chapters in the manga, and Sailor Moon's previous approach to adapting the manga was a ratio of 1 episode for every manga chapter which some had an issue with, but I personally didn't mind it due to the different approach to tone and character. However with the combined run time of both Eternal films clocking in at a collective 160 minutes and accounting for TV standards of opening intro, recap, animation and opening credits giving a generous estimate of 18 minutes of story per episode, Eternals total runtime really only allows by the standards of the established ratio 8 chapters maybe 9 if you want to be extra generous and stretch. Eternal feels like its trying to keep the same structure as the events in the manga, but because it has less time to space out these events like it did in Sailor Moon Crystal you're getting the plot details but they don't resonate as well because it keeps moving without allowing moments to sink in.Sailor Moon Eternal still boasts the strong animation and music of Sailor Moon Crystal, and the dub cast does as good a job as ever bringing their characters to life. I did like the addition of a ticking clock element for both Mamoru and Usagi that added some desperation to the stakes, and I also enjoyed following up with the characters of the Outer Guardians following the departure at the end of Season Three, but the way in which the story rushes through every point didn't allow me to enjoy these elements to the extent I wanted and I really feel this goes back to the underlying issue of cramming this story arc into two feature films rather than allowing it to be a TV show as it clearly wants to be.Sailor Moon Eternal has all the elements you've come to expect from the Sailor Moon Crystal series with gorgeous animation, engaging action, lovable characters, and strong relationships both romantic and platonic, but they're not giving the breathing room needed to get the full impact of the story. As is, Sailor Moon Eternal is fine, and if you're invested in the Sailor Moon Crystal continuity (as I am) you'll find all that you've come to love from this incarnation of the series, but it really wasn't designed to be told in feature films. There is talk that the Stars arc will be adapted next and when it is I'll gladly see it, but I really hope they return to TV in the next incarnation rather than creating a feature film gauntlet."

With its lysergic display, its complex and delusional temporal and narrative structure, its humor and the audacity and naturalness with which it proposes gender, sexual orientation and relationship issues for its characters.Review:When a total lunar eclipse occurs in the city of Tokyo, time stops and the Sailor Guardians meet again to face the agents of the Dead Moon Circus and a power that commands them and that wants to take over the Golden Crystal.Return as a film of more than two and a half hours (there were previous ones), divided into two parts, of the Japanese cult series and gay icon Sailor Moon (in particular from the Crystal saga), Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon Eternal: The Movie, Called by Netflix as suitable for ages 7 and up, it unfolds a complex, crazy, romantic and apocalyptic story that is not easy to follow.The film shows us a universe of heroines and villains almost entirely female, of warrior princesses who reunite from their "civil" life. It is a world with characters that change age, gay and non-traditional families, trans and androgynous characters, romantic relationships between girls and adults, princely but irrelevant boys and where the celebrated transformations of the heroines (the Sailor Guardians ) with its crystals, skirts and stylized nudes, young people and women in a state of permanent amazement, a magical world with jingles of Candy Crash and outbursts of humor.The film respects the simple and bright anime graphics of the original series and allows interesting licenses with respect to the occasional character in that regard.In short, intended primarily for children and pre-adolescent female audiences, this return of the characters from the cult series Sailor Moon (and a few more) retains its potential to perplex (and somewhat overwhelm) adult audiences with its lysergic display, its complex and delusional temporal and narrative structure and the audacity with which it proposes gender and sexual orientation issues."

Gorgeous animation but such a pointless messy plot! It was very boring and took one week for me to finish."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10635042/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," A sweet, serene Dream Arc ","Lovely adaptation of the manga, gorgeous art style from Kazuko Tadano who came up with something new and fresh for the series. The Eternal character designs (inner senshi and Usagi) are almost identical to page 68 of volume two actually ! I don't see any resemblance to the 90s apart from the attacks/transformations. I am not sure why they just copied the old ones, as a 90s fan I wanted something a bit more creative not a remake. Uranus really stood out, if they can show more creativity with the others it would be great.This is the first Crystal arc I have seen so far as previous art style was not something I would enjoy in a "modern" animeI would love to give Eternal a 10/10 but unfortunately the music was a huge letdown. Apart from Moon Color Chainon and Watashi-tachi ni Naritakute (cover) I did not think the music went well with the atmosphere of this film. The dramatic battle at the end especially also had unsuitable music. Very forgettable.I found no issues with the pacing personally. It was mostly the atmosphere that was very calm instead of dark and tense. Eg when Mamoru is in distress Chibiusa just sits there gasping instead of showing actual concern. Very weird. Maybe it was the voice acting as well that could have been more passionate, at times they sound disturbingly calm even when going through the nightmare sequencesLoved the background style, gave depth to the Juban district and and the outers' home, some shots are really beautiful to look at.The manga has plenty of violence so not sure why nothing more serious is ever shown. I also think both the films deserved a proper opening.If they fix the music for Stars then this will be peak Sailor Moon for me.I also don't think it would be fair to compare this to the 90s version, they re both independent after all. I don't think one is better than the other and since they show different stories it's not worth analyzing the differences. Eternal is a lovely film and hopefully Stars is next."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10635042/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," If you watched the 90's version ","For anyone who has watched classic sailor moon, Crystal keeps doing it better, this adaptation does justice to the essence of the story. It's way more mature and places sailor moon in a higher place along manga and anime most successful of the world such as Dragon Ball, Saint Seiya, One punch man, Naruto etc. The dream arc is truly redeemed."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10635042/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","1"," "Eternal" because it went on forever ","What a hot, incoherent mess this was. Two 90-ish minute "episodes" of the flattest, shrillest dubbing plodding through a "plot" that made no sense. The Dead Moon circus wasn't menacing at all, Nehelenia was a pointless, prosaic villain who ultimately did nothing, and the sailor senshi were at their absolute worst racing from one scene to another without having any awareness as to what was going on.Pegasus essentially did nothing respective to the senshi's fight or revealing the meaning of the Golden Crystal, and Elesion served no purpose. Maybe it was more punctuated in the manga, but to see that already scant attempt at a story unfold through animation was just painful nonsense that at once moved too fast to really get a sense of what little narrative there was, and yet far too slowly across 180 minutes of absolutely nothing of consequence happening. But no surprise, since that's all Netflix's formula is these days."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10635042/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," The animation looks gorgeous! ","As a girl born in the 90s, Sailor Moon was my favorite TV show. Watching the 2 episodes of Sailor Moon Eternal was an amazing experience! The episodes were beautifully paced and I felt like a little girl again.The story felt slightly more mature than the classic anime. It was also obvious that the writers wanted to make Usagi more powerful and less dependent on Mamo-chan. Their chemistry also seemed much better than what I saw in Sailor Moon Crystal."

The 90s were far more childish but we were able to understand the connection that grew between little Lady and Helios. Furthermore Nehelenia has lost her grace she didn't do anything except showing her disgrace and hate to the sailor team by words. Pace was ok much more in second film but I wanted to see more Amazon's quarter reincarnation. I DO like that sailor senshi and tuxedo mask were mor powerful and useful than the anime.The worst part was the music. 90s anime had an exceptional music theme here you almost forgot the minute after I heard it.The best part : animation. Not even comparable to the crystal season I really like it how they bring sailor senshi into the new era."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10635042/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," 25 Years Later and Time Has Been Good to This Lady ","Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon Eternal is the continuation of the Sailor Moon Crystal series and is a direct adaptation of the Dream Arc of the original Manga. Like most of Crystal; it follows the Manga very faithfully but there are some changes that mostly work out for the better. In the Manga the weapons "spoke"; it would have been a little cheesy for that to be pulled off even though that as a lifelong Sailormoon fan, even I can admit.The animation is a huge improvement from Season III. Although some of the original 1995 Transformation and Attack scenes were more polished; they certainly looked better than last earlier seasons. The Moon Crisis Make Up sequence is not as polished and somewhat glamorous but the music is better.The subtitles are mostly accurate; I was hoping that they would have been as accurate as Netflix did with Neon Genesis Evangelion; but oh well... The film is two parts and the total running time is 140 minutes.There is no pacing issues, in my opinion. If you were disappointed in the earlier episodes of Crystal, Eternal may bring back faith for a very likely adaption to the Stars Arc.Rated TV-14 for Fantasy Violence."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10635042/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," A good combination ","This movie is a good combination of 90's version and Sailormoon Crystal. The old one was childish but had some fun anime parts, also Mamaru was really annoying. In Crystal, the chracter drawings were unrealistic and disturbing yet it was more mature. This one combines the good parts and more loyal to manga. I hope we watch Sailor Stars season too, either movie or a whole season."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10635042/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," A bit flawed, but very enjoyable! ","Let me start out by stating that I am mostly a fan of the classic 90s series of Sailor Moon, having loved the characters, humor and gorgeous artstyle for as long as I can think. With that being said, I unfortunately have to admit that I found the newer Crystal series a bit lacking in each of this three categories - at least up to the much improved third season - which meant that the series overall was somewhat of a disappointment for me.As with these earlier entries, the two new Eternal movies, continuing the story, were to follow the manga, which had me slightly worried that the same mistakes that already made the first two season hard to watch for me would be repeated: Not only was there another artstyle change, some earlier trailers seemingly implied that the animation, despite the long wait, would again be sloppy. Even worse than that, the plan to cram a whole story arc into barely two hours of film suggested that many of the smaller scenes that make Sailor Moon for me might again have to be scrapped, leaving no time for characterization, humor or heartfelt moments.However, after watching the long anticipated movies twice now, I can gladly say that my worries were unfounded - at least for the most part.First of all, the story follows the manga to a tee, with only a few very minor differences. While that indeed means that the pacing is pretty hectic at some points, I still felt that they left enough space for genuine emotions and funny scenes to not make it feel too rushed or bland. Despite that I would have appreciated if certain scenes were given just a few more moments to breath, and, as someone who knows the corresponding manga chapters pretty well, I am not entirely sure how well first-time experiencers of the story can follow the movies' plot.On another note, the animation (for the most part) is some of the best the franchise has ever seen, and I am not only talking about the Crystal series, but also the 90s anime. Expect no Studio Ghibli, but I think if you liked any animated Sailor Moon content so far you are more likely to be delighted than disappointed. There certainly are a few noticable flaws (like some wonky transitions and faces) to find if you really want to look for them, but I can say that they did not influence my personal enjoyment, what did however (in a positive way) were the many gorgeous panels taken straight from the manga, as well as some really appealing attack animations.In summary, these are two very nice movies to watch if you go into them open minded and with the right expectations. If you only know the 90s anime so far, this is maybe not exactly your childhood cartoon in which crybaby Serena "fights evil by moonlight", but it contains many of the elements that made the series so special for many people, including me. If you already know the manga story, I can honestly not see you hating these entries unless you expect god-tier animations or lots of added content.Ultimately this makes the movies a very solid 8/10 for me, although I am sure many will enjoy them even more than that."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10636130/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","3"," close encounter of the sixth sense... ","Or just nonsense. Well its a 90 to 10 formula movie, with just 10% good story , acting and message, the remaining 90 % are just mumbo jumbo experimental movie making on high self esteem, which could have been busting the block in the late 70' or early 80's, like ''e.t.'', ''contact'', '' close encounter of the third kind'', '' the philadelphia experiment'' and all the 10's of 1000s of the scifi drama genre made since then, but just not in the year 2021 ad.Its just a pure fact that to fetch a grumpy old mans interest youll need room for space, not close up facial panning of rather untrained actors, youll also need some confidence on the truthfactor on the complot, are there any sense of truth in the material theyve plotted the story with? , and they need a good production managment and some utterly ingenious prop makers to make it all convincing. I think theyve missed the tools to succeed in their mission to make sensory disabled persons into sensible caracters, most of all due to lack of budget.So therefore just 3 for the effort, there are better moves out there, take a dive under watersurface and youll see, that this was time spent that youll never get back."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10636130/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," Mediocre Sci Fi with decent premise and no follow through ","First, this is (currently) listed on Amazon Prime under another fake "18+" rating. I've been tracking Amazon's using this stunt to get people to watch their films. In reality this is a PG-rated-- though not "family" film (the plot is a little too high-brow for children). No bad language (at all) , no nudity, no sexuality, etc. PG rated-- and even that merely for complexity of story.Beyond that, this is a mediocre film with an interesting premise (humans can develop far more senses than our limited five)... with zero follow-through. I won't spoil the film by going into specifics, but this flick starts with some promise and ends with mumbo-jumbo grammar-school-play fizzle.It is of note that they hired handicapped people to play the parts. Good on them. It's a shame they didn't give them meatier and more meaningful parts to play. This could have been so much better; I can think of a half dozen ways it could have ended smarter. Instead it just kind of plopped and left viewers regretting the time wasted on this amateur "fan film" quality production.Kudos to the actors for doing a fairly decent job. The directing was even pretty decent, considering the environment of the plot. It was the basic storytelling and ending that really let the film down. Said it before and I'll say it again: If you don't have a good story from the beginning, don't make the film. They really needed to hash this out a lot better before investing money and energy on an ill-conceived story line."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10636130/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Smart, flawed, cringy and fantastic. ","Obviously this is a low budget production. That being said, the second half of the picture was shot very nicely with proper framing and good editing. The audio track was rather 80's synthy, but personally I like that.The subject matter is very interesting and properly fleshed out. A good sci-fi basis for a movie that thoroughly explores that space and then takes it into the realm of actual science fiction.The writing varies in quality from flat and contrived to funny and at times excellent. It seems like the majority of the work was put into the science narratives and the character development. There are awkward moments, especially the first half of the picture. The start is quite slow and feels cramped but this is resolved as soon as the characters start to move.The acting is good enough to convey the narrative. Like the writing sometimes rather good and at other times a bit wooden or staccato. But in most scenes the good outweighed the bad and when it did not, it was forgivable.I feel like most of this was shot chronologically because as the story progressed, the quality in all areas improved. There were no unnecessary sidetracks and the one b-line that did not close explicitly was the family situation with the protagonist and her family, but this was resolved implicitly so no loose ends.Once I got into it, I rather enjoyed it, especially the exploration of the main theme. Quite impressive actually. Solid 7."

But, one cannot deny the heart and love that so many put into this, in front of and behind the camera. And, it's because everyone truly wanted to tell a good story. Good sci-fi starts with "what if?" and proceeds from there, keeping everything thing else as real as possible, including the people.

Even calling them actors is generous because the performances are really bad, lines are delivered with wooden faces, peppered here and there with over-the-top arm waving to make it look more dramatic. An "action" scene was so involuntarily funny that I almost choked on my coffee with laughter when something as simple as a car door being slammed shut was fumbled beyond belief.I can only suggest this flick if you plan on making fun of it while watching. Otherwise avoid as the plague."

Do not try to compare the series with this if you can. The movie will lose out for sure.Politics are thrown out (mostly, maybe if you are good willing you are able to see some small references) and it is all about the personal journey of 3 main characters - a "family" of sorts. Now I do not know what they were based on and I read there are many things that are anything but accurate. Having said that, if you suspend your disbelief and go with the flow you'll be able to enjoy the movie.Well enjoy may be too strong of a word. There is enough tension from start to finish - although it does take a few moments ... or an introduction to the characters before it goes on. There are quite a few things that bugged me, but overall the movie worked and I was there with the characters. Again, it will depend how willing you are to suspend your disbelief ... otherwise you may not want to watch this at all."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10648714/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," Boiling soup on brittle bones... ","This 2021 movie titled "Chernobyl" (aka "Chernobyl: Abyss") actually felt like a very, very unnecessary movie to have been made. Why? Well, because the story has been told many times before in other movies or TV series, and often with more impact and entertainment value.Well sure, I will say that if you haven't seen other movies or TV series that deal with the tragedy that took place with the Chernobyl power plant, then sure this 2021 movie will provide adequate, if not actually good, entertainment. I will give that much credit to writers Elena Ivanova and Aleksey Kazakov, sure.The storyline told in "Chernobyl" was one that I was well familiar with already, as I am no newcomer to movies or TV series that depict the events that took place on April 26th, 1986, and the aftermath in its wake. So because of that, then this 2021 movie felt sort of obsolete and wholly unnecessary.The acting in the movie was good, and I can't claim to be familiar with a single actor or actress on the cast list, as I am not well-traversed in the Russian cinema. But the people cast for the various roles definitely did good jobs in bringing the characters to life.And the atmosphere in the movie was definitely good as well, adding a lot to the movie in overall.My rating of director Danila Kozlovskiy's 2021 movie "Chernobyl" lands on a very bland and mediocre five out of ten stars. This was definitely a watchable movie, but for us that are already well-familiar with cinematic representations of the accident, then this movie was just not delivering where it mattered."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10648714/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," Real life drama dressed up like a bad '90s blockbuster ","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningAlexey Karpushin (Danila Kozlovskiy) is a burned out firefighter (no pun intended) battling the bottle and trying to rekindle a romance with old flame Olga (Oksana Akinshana), and strike a bond with her son. Then an unthinkable disaster occurs, when the Chernobyl nuclear reactor explodes, resulting in mass injury and death. But then Alexey, Valera the Engineer (Filipp Avdeev) and Boris the military diver (Nikoly Kozak) must race against time to cut off the flow from a reservoir that is slowly heating up with contaminated water.The events at the Chernobyl nuclear reactor in 1986 remain embedded in the global consciousness years after it occurred, the biggest showcase of the perils of nuclear power in living memory. And, like every major disaster that gains worldwide publicity, there is potential to make a (hopefully respectful) dramatisation of. Rather than getting the Hollywood treatment, here is a Russian produced effort, from star and director Danila Kozlovskiy. The trouble is, maybe he watched too many corny Hollywood blockbusters as a kid.Netflix deliver this as a slick, polished big scale production, but it soon becomes clear it's a smaller scale Eastern production, with scabbier production values that start to show. Rather than explore the potential of the human drama on display, Kozlovskiy instead follows the template of a standard corny '90s Hollywood blockbuster, with all the standard tropes, from the alpha male hero battling his demons, and stand tall heroics. Verging generously over the two hour mark, it's also indulgently overlong to further compound its problems.What could have been a searing examination of the lives of those most closely affected by this massive human tragedy, is instead just a curious homage to the sort of daft big scale blockbusters that got left behind in the 90's. **"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10648714/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","2"," Terrible ","Greetings from Lithuania."Chernobyl: Abyss" (2021) is a terrible movie. I think that after this disastrously bad movie, Danila Kozlovskiy's carrier as a director will end pretty soon. This movie felt like it took / ripped all from Hollywood movies produced some 20 years ago. It was like a rollecoster of all bad scenes from movie like "Peal Harbor" (2000) and beyond, with quick cuts every second showing and focusing on nothing meaningful for a second.Overall, skip "Chernobyl: Abyss" and better watch HBO's masterpiece series than this crap. This movie done everything wrong. Even a very talented Oksana Akinshina did not had anything to do in this movie, which says a lot. Its not just a bad film, its a terrible one."

","This was so much better than the poor show about Chernobyl, of you re looking to be entertain watch this one. If you want to be bored af just watch the HBO show, both are different Propaganda so it doesn't matter.Also it was in original language, not with stupid brittish accent . How Can some people prefer the HBO show to the movie ? I really cannot understand people taste today. They have no taste."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10648714/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Definitely, not as bad as the ratings suggest !! ","I am really astonished at the low ratings for this Netflix version of Chernobyl called Chernobyl 1986. Yes, I have seen the HBO mini series, Chernobyl and loved every bit of it, except for the fact that it was terribly odd to see Ukrainians and Russians speaking in English. Compared to the HBO version head on, yes this one doesn't stand a chance, as the HBO version Sheds more details on the catastrophic events and had a far superior impression on the viewers minds. Chernobyl 1986, focuses on the personal life of a fictional character who plays a major role in containing certain aspects of the disaster.The problem with Chernobyl 1986 is that, the movie looses about a good thirty minutes in introducing the lead character and his love life. Things get on track when disaster unfolds, it is when things get intense and sometimes even gripping. Lot of other characters are introduced along the way, and the core story moves to, locating and opening a valve near the reactor, though this part was already covered in the HBO series, but still, it keeps the viewers minds interested.Cinematography is brilliant, with some shots really exceptional. Screenplay is good enough to keep the viewer interested by just telling a human side of the story, than a technical one. Production design, music, costumes and makeup were excellent. Editing is good and the movie has a runtime of 135 minutes. CGI has some good and bad bits equally. Sound design is excellent. Most of the actors play their parts decently with Oksana Akinshina's performance the best among the lot.Overall, assuming that the viewer has seen the HBO mini series of the same name and knows all the technical details of the disaster, this movie will give you, a further crash course on true blue patriotism, soul touching love, sacrifice, some nail biting action sequences and a lesson on humanity. All these may sound very cheesy, but thankfully Chernobyl 1986 is definitely not, One has to thank its director Danila Kozlovskiy for that. I would recommend this movie to all the people who have watched HBO mini series, for a follow up of things. Watch it if you don't have anything else to do. 6.7 stars out of 10 for a movie that celebrates humanity and love above everything else."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10648714/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Decent enough to watch ","A decent Movie, nothing special, watchable enough with some good Thrills here and there. The Love Story angle is a bit too idealized, something which an Authoritarian State like Russia would approve.I mean 2 good looking People staying single for a Decade because they sort of waited for each other? Also typical Politically Incorrect Russian Scenese like stopping a Bus to get a Girl to go with him. The Wokes would go livid with that Scene, LOL."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10648714/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," VERY, VERY, VERY POOR MOVIE ","Many others have already said that there just isn't any comparison at all in quality between this movie and the really excellent TV series that was made a couple of years ago; a series that I watch regularly and very happily."Chernobyl 1986", or "Chernobyl: Abyss" as it also appears to be listed here on IMDb, is a pretty poor movie. But what really annoyed me was that the audience was expected to believe that the main character, the fireman, Alexei, was somehow immune to the effects of ionizing radiation while all around him, those who was exposed to far lesser levels of radiation were dying like flies. He goes into the plant after the explosion to rescue two others and has no radiation effects at all while the two he rescued quickly died. Then he goes into the basement level of the plant to try to drain the water under the reactor building and seems ok after his heavy exposure there as well. Then, and this is truly impossible to believe, he goes into the basement of the building for a second time and is also heavily exposed again. Finally, this superhuman guy appears to suffer some ill effects of all that exposure to radiation but we don't see him die, as he most certainly would.All this unbelievability is driven by a plot that's not good and by a love story which, in the circumstances, also appears quite beyond possibility.Yes, folks, don't waste your time with this one. Just watch the HBO series instead. It's thoroughly wonderful.JMV."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10648714/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","3"," This movie is Abyssmal ","So first of all it is dubbed and dubbed badly. Next up nothing happens for half an hour. Apart from a dude finds his long lost love well for a bit. Then we get to the meat of the movie, will have ever sit up and be a man? Yep that is the main plot as far as can work out. Then the power station goes boom! Is he going to become a man, take care of Mother Soviet Union and his family?By the time it gets down to the movie you will be thinking, who cares? This is the weak sibling of the TV series. It is not as good as the BBC version either.The effects are pretty good and there are some good scenes of devastation. The two leads are effective but they do not have much to work with.So if you have watched Cameron's Titanic you will guess the plot. Take Titanic away and put the power station in and you will have basically the same movie. A love story set among the ruins.It passes the time but could have been so much better."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10648714/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","2"," Netflix does it again ","Another crappy movie from Netflix. I have always been very interested in the Chernobyl accident and in the town of Pripyat. The HBO series was great, almost a documentary. But this movie, is just crap. Its a love story between a fireman and his ex. Sure there are some fine footage of the Chernobyl accident, and those very pretty good. Also some fine footage of Pripyat. That was rather well done. I looks like Pripyat in 1986, before the disaster. But thats all. The rest is boring. I could might as well be a love story with any disaster as a background. Come on Netflix."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10648714/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","1"," Fake ","While the HBO series brought us a fabricated female genius scientist who never existed in real life, just to shove in feminist b.s., this series invented its own falsehoods. It takes real events, but puts made-up characters in the shoes of very real people, without caring for what these people did. It does so brazenly and deliberately. If the story revolved around fictional characters who find themselves in this crisis without playing pivotal roles in major events surrounding the crisis, it would be perfectly ok. But when you take for instance the divers who went under the reactor, and invent who they were and what they did, you commit a kind of fraud that is inexcusable. These people deserve to be represented in cinema in a way that is as accurate as possible. Otherwise you are lying to people and creating a false image of these heroes. It's particularly bad when you have no good reason to resort to fantasy to such a degree. The filmmakers thought they could just make anything up if they felt like it. And the worst part of it is that it is not very interesting or emotionally engaging."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10648714/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," not great, not very bad ","It is 85 % about a love story, and 15 % about the happenings of the disaster, 0% about the reasons behind and the responsible people. It is not even close to the mini-series "Chernobyl" from HBO which is the best thing that I have watched for many, many years. Overwhelming tension and fascination and information on what was really was going on back then. Personally, I am very interested in that topic because I was a teen when it happened and I was in Germany. Trust me when I tell you, in reality, they lied in the news and reports. Nothing about the true risks back then. It was ALL about what to eat, and what to avoid eating. Nothing about the real dangers, about the fact that half of the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe and even parts of east Germany have been close to the edge of a disaster for these countries for at least 100 years and millions of deaths! Unimaginable. Back to the movie: watchable if you want to watch a mediocre "drama/action/love story"."

The hero is a flawed character who seeks to recreate the past with his old flame a la Jay Gatsby. The Chernobyl disaster disrupts his campaign and forces him to confront his moral shortcomings.Soviet-era incompetence is not whitewashed and at one point a character is sent to Switzerland for medical treatment because, as Aleksey the fireman admits, "Their doctors are better than ours." All in all, an intriguing look by Russians at one of their country's most horrendous failures."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10648714/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," Waste of time ","Boring love story. Stupid dialogue. The only thing this film has going is showing how life in Russia was in the eighties. So have look for 15 miniutes and then shut this crap off and never watch it again."

It's about a family living in those times and what it's like.At the same time, I have to admit that I did not care about the family drama. I was completely bored with the female character, I had no idea what she was doing or what her character wanted. She is probably the weakest link in this movie and that is terrible because she has a huge role in the movie.The main character is so wishy washy. I did not understand what he wanted. It started out well but then it got very ridiculous in the end. The chemistry is everywhere but it started out well. I have no idea why they decided to make it so awkward. But if you think about it too much, this movie is going to get worse and worse. He is just so convenient. He is in the most convenient places and just happens to know the most convenient things....Also if you know the story of the Chernobyl, it will hurt your head. So do not go into this movie having seen the miniseries or knowing anything about the Chernibyl. Just imagine that this movie happens in another Universe."

I thought it would be a fresh, alternative perspective after the phenomenal HBO version, especially given that this actually came from the country where Chernobyl happened. Plus, anything to raise people's awareness of the atrocities of the incident.Sadly, "Chernobyl 1986" is quite rubbish. Its main problem is that it is boring! How can you film a story about Chernobyl and make it completely devoid of any drama or tension? Talk about dull beyond belief. Half my family went to bed before the end.Not helped by the fact that the protagonist sprints through the nuclear power plant - in scenes worthy of Hollywood at its most dire level of cringeworthy - pulling out his burnt, dying, blood-vomiting comrades from the ruins...and he remains completely unscathed. At the rate that character was going, he'd have been dead in about ten minutes.Watch for a drunk, popcorn 'bad-film' fest; otherwise skip."

All-in-all, this is poorly managed from behind-the-camera, and shows a lack of creative thinking... #Scattergun."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10648714/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," I don't get all the hate ","First of all this movie isn't at all a copycat of or competitor for the HBO show Chernobyl.The plot is obviously built around the same real historical event but similarities end right around there.It has a whole different approach really being not a grand and comprehensive drama about the catastrophe but more a story about a vagabond reluctant to commit to anything learning about dedication, selflessness and sacrifice in the time of hardship and becoming a full fledged hero in the end.A rather well written character arc.Now the way the USSR of the 1980's is presented is typical of more recent Russian movies meaning a tad romanticized showing a cleaner, happier, more modern, more free country than it was in reality but not overly so and there is still plenty of honesty and criticism involved in the narrative too.All in all this is a decent movie, not propaganda and not a rip off."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10648714/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," A little bit underated ","This is the first movie I saw about Chernobyl. I haven't seen yet the series so it was good for me. I learned a lot about liquidators. I didn't know at all this operation. The only negative thing about this movie is the propaganda. I can't believe all the facts about Soviet Union and how they controled the situation. I don't think it's absolutely objective. Nevertheless, it's a good way to see the other side, how Russians see this catastrophe, their own perspective. The direction in my opinion is good and realistic, definately not apocryphal. They did a good job and I liked the love story. It wasn't only a history but a romantic movie."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10648714/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Good movie ","You just have to keep in mind that part of the plot is fiction, even if it's based on the Chernobyl disaster.

Not best movie ever but way far from the worst!"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10649008/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," daft and low on... ","Quality, but hits the head in the wall of nothingness and dialouges written either with invisible link, or just some clean blank papers. Its a film about a woman and a man that makes rather stupid selfish descisions, being hesitant to eachother in their relationship till all solutions has been tried until the aversion against eachother becomes far too strong to rescue. So its a downspiral turn especially for the male part and this film tend to take this much too far and relentless.Its the trivialities of life that makes love come easy, or to some, it strangles love completely. A desperate search to consider if your love is the right person to live with for the rest of your life gone to far and too long. So if youre in for a comedy its not in a common standard and all of it becomes like everyones marriage, loving you is a dirty job but somebodys got to do it.I think the acting and the dialouges in the battlefield were mighty fine, its just the plotting and a little bit lack of spontanity from the direction that kills this curious male chat. The clarinett and fagotto inspired score marks the transitions very well, more score there aint. There are plenty wisdomewords and advice you may learn from and for once the actors of a british film speaks clear enough for a near deaf norwegian grumpy old man to watch without cc's. A tiny recommend, a sequel could be an exciting project, dont you think?"

You really need to think out of the box, make something creative to stand out. "I'm not in Love" fails to do that. The one liners fell flat, the chemistry between Rob and his friends fell flat, some scenes felt like watching a theater play.The love story looked forced.

It's funny that we really don't see many films like this - in attempts to generalize and gloss over it, or wishing for a sugar sweet finish, we can use romantic comedy as a way to escape our own questions, or fantasize our own better endings. This film invites us to look at ourselves, and uses humour and pathos to get there. At times uncomfortable, at times laughable, the characters bring us up close with difficult conversations about relationship, expectation and love. As a viewer, I found it an honest film - and that honesty, as well as the performances of the actors themselves, felt like an important gift that that brings the audience into maturity and honours a film tradition that demands engagement out of a friendship, or at least a kind of kinship, with its viewer."

How privileged are we to get a rare glimpse, to look at things from a man's point of view , not just the main character who is surprisingly sympathetic, but his friends each one representing a different type of man at a different life stage for things and people are not just black and white. The women aren't left out either. But more than just a romantic comedy, this film which sped by which is always a good sign shows the little things that make up our everyday life. The link to the childhood effect on how men and women live their adult relationships is often overlooked and it was unusual and refreshing to see this handled here in a lighthearted but effective way. It also brings out things that everyone experiences of the banalities andmundanities of true love when or if we even find it that people often don't talk about.. It touches on the challenges men and women face every day and what it means to be human.. The movie was over before I knew it even though I rewatched bits of it. Loved it."

Comedy is as cheap as comedy gets, and as cringey as it can be, casting is terrible and even actors who are good (which is basically only Karim to some extent) are doing a terrible job and pulling off zero effort.And that's not mentioning Huda el Mufti whose facial expressions and acting are SO BAD, she really should NEVER appear on film or tv or even on social media EVER AGAIN, unless she plans on not talking.Writing is so terrible and continuity is screwed up. Nothing about the movie is creative, nothing even took effort, it was just an effortless sploof that was not funny nor good. I was literally banging my head to the wall behind my head the entire time watching this movie with my family who fell asleep literally 10 minutes in because of how bad the jokes are.This is the first time I ever left a review on IMDB, I would've hoped it would be for something like Breaking Bad or Game of Thrones or Rick and Morty, but I was so angry with the film that I just had to break my silence, so thanks for wasting my first review and for ruining a century of egyptian film with this stupid movie and I would like to personally request that IMDB adds negative ratings because this movie deserves a -7/10.

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10661500/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," "I'm a codified system of beliefs." ","Mixed feelings about this film. Written originally as a stage play, it does have a static feel to it with it's single location in a hotel room. When it started, it felt a little corny to me in the way the Bible was represented by a real live person, but I guess that was the only way to get the Bible message across. The idea that Pete (Bradley Gosnell) was the son of a pastor went a long way to explain how he had so much familiarity with passages from the holy book, but it might have been more interesting to have the conversation take place between Gideon (Daniel Floren) and an agnostic or an atheist. As it is, Pete spoke from the side of one who had faith but lost it when his prayers about his father weren't answered to his satisfaction. I'm not sure if Gideon's responses were convincing enough to sway one's belief either way, and their keeping score with points didn't resonate with this viewer because it felt like a gimmick. I assume one must reconcile the film's off screen gunshot ending with one's own personal view of what might have happened, as there were a number of possible scenarios. Pete could have shot Leo, he could have committed suicide, or he could have fired the weapon target-less out of frustration, while Gideon in the hotel room anguished over the outcome. A happy ending in the picture would have been called for, but just as in most matters of religion, the answer comes down to a matter of faith."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10661710/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," better than expected ","Before the popularity of MMA, Mickey Kelley (Sean Patrick Flanery) is an early master of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu learned under the legendary Renzo Gracie. He only fights to defend himself. He's in Dubai for a demonstration when he rescues paralegal Layla (Katrina Bowden) from a creepy rich Russian. They get married and have a baby. Despite her reservations, he goes back to Dubai to fight in a private tournament for the money. It goes badly.The story is much better than expected. It's a very good underdog tale. Flanery is playing it very reserved and maybe he's playing it too reserved. It's not the most magnetic performance but he does well in the fight scenes. It's missing an early scene when he follows Krav Maga into the bathroom. It doesn't need to show the fight but it does need to show that he didn't jump the guy. It has to be a honorable fight. Katrina Bowden is not known for great acting but she is very good in this. There are great ideas like Taco's porch. On the other hand, Karate guy gets a little too much. He would be better if his threats are less cartoonish. He could threaten to fire him and his threats are better with quiet intensity. The final fight also has a few issues. The movie keeps making the point that MMA is not as barbaric as the layman expects but the final fight ramps up the brutality a lot. In fact, Mickey does something very dirty which diminishes his honor. The second problem is Dennis Quaid's personal revelation. It's too convenient, coincidental, and comes out of left field. The third is that Mickey would never be able to collect on that bet. The Russian would never pay. The film needs to make the Shiekh the guarantor behind the bet. Quite frankly, I was going to give this a 7 but the last act has too many of these little issues."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10661710/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," A Champ of a Jiu-Jitsu Movie ",""Boondock Saints" star Sean Patrick Flanery holds Black Belts in both karate and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, so it's no surprise he staged all the stunts in co-writer & director Alex Ranarivelo's "Born A Champion," (*** OUT OF ****), a sentimental, hard knocks, mixed martial arts tearjerker that borrows heavily from Sylvester Stallone's boxing classic "Rocky" (1976). Indeed, Flanery isn't so much playing a fictional character as much as he is playing himself since he is a real-life Jiu Jitsu instructor with no aspirations to tangle in tournaments. He prefers to stop fights rather than start them. Like the film's heroic protagonist Mickey Kelly, Flanery owns his own Jiu Jitsu gym and trains clients of all ages. Mickey Kelly's most endearing trait is his sense of utter humility. Kelly contends with far greater adversity than Flanery will ever face. Meantime, Flanery infuses Mickey with an amiable charisma but without a shred of pugnacity. Flanery dreamed up the origins story for this globe-trotting fight feature, and Ranarivelo and he have taken stereotypes and turned them into unforgettable characters. This R-rated, 102-minute, melodrama boasts a seasoned cast, co-starring Dennis Quaid as MMA fight promoter Dick Mason, Katrina Bowden as Mickey's love interest, and Costas Mandylor as an unsavory Greek fur salesman. Flanery and Ranarivelo stick Mickey in a variety of suspenseful situations. The initial clash between Mickey and Dimitris spawns ill-feelings between the two men. Mickey is pretty saintly when he turns head over heels for his future wife, Layla, (Katrina Bowden of "Piranha 3DD"), a pretty North Carolina paralegal lured to Dubai under false pretenses to model furs for the unscrupulous Dimitris Kostopoulos. Mickey's best friend, a tattooed Hispanic auto mechanic named Taco (Maurice Compte of "Den of Thieves") provides voice-over narration and shares his perspective about our hero's enigmatic backstory. The layer of dramatic oversight Taco contributes with his running commentary throughout "Born A Champion" enhances what otherwise would have remained strictly a straightforward saga exploiting its tear-jerking twists and turns.Mickey is flying to Dubai to teach the young son of affluent Sheikh Bin Khalid (Ali Afshar of "Three Kings") the ABCs of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. During the flight, Mickey helps out an elderly woman, Mrs. Miller, who cannot bear to be separated from her husband in first-class. The first-class passenger sitting beside Mr. Miller is Layla Boudreau, and she is delighted to give up her seat so the elderly married couple can sit together. Afterward, Mickey and Katrina enjoy the rest of the flight sitting beside each other. Mickey doesn't believe in love at first sight, but he finds himself hopelessly attracted to Layla. Later, Layla finds herself in trouble with the arrogant Dimitris. It seems Kostopoulos made improper advances, and Layla slapped him for his impudence. Mickey comes to her rescue and disposes of Dimitris' overconfident bodyguard. Since she has defied Dimitris, the fur merchant has defunded her return flight to America, leaving her stranded in Dubai. At Mickey's request, Sheikh Khalid intercedes and furnishes Layla with a ticket back to America. Later, once each has returned stateside, they rekindle their passion during a whirlwind romance. Taco winds up officiating their marriage in a private ceremony at his auto repair garage. Later, Layla bears Mickey a son named Kyd. Mickey wants only the best for his family, and he jeopardizes his health when he enters an unsanctioned MMA competition in the Arabian desert. Things are going swell for Mickey and Layla until adversity topples our hero. Mickey's depraved opponent Marco Blaine (real-life Brazilian MMA fighter Edson Barboza) sucker punches our hero during the moment when each fighter shakes hands with each other before the competition commences. Marco batters Mickey unmercifully to the mat, and Marco's savage blows break Mickey's eye socket and partially detach his right eye. Tragically, Mickey's career as a championship contender is kaput! He had received a $25,000 payday as a down payment for a new home for Layla and his son. Mind you, Edson Barboza is one of those despicable villains who is conspicuously lacking a crumb of sympathy for his adversaries. Mickey serves as a lowly gym custodian when he isn't giving private lessons on the side for peanuts. Layla is terrified by Mickey's other part-time job bouncing drunks at a grubby bar because he could lose his sight. Meantime, Marco ascends to the summit of his profession as one of MMA's undefeated fighters, and fans worship him like a god. Abruptly, public opinion reverses itself when a VHS video of Marco sucker punching Mickey goes viral online. Marco's fans are shocked by his sadism and talk of a rematch arises. Layla refuses to let Mickey climb back into the ring with Marco again."Born A Champion" rarely pulls its punches as Mickey and Layla quarrel about the rematch. As much as Layla abhors violence, she loves Mickey enough to make sacrifices, even though she dreads the worst may happen. "Born A Champion" doesn't give Mickey a break, and his victory over Marco comes with terrible consequences. Like Stallone's Rocky, Mickey gets his rematch, but his life takes a turn for the worst before he challenges Marco again. Since he cannot land a professional rematch because his eye sight is impaired, Mickey settles for another unsanctioned competition. By this time, fight promoter Dick Mason (Dennis Quaid of "Midway") has entered the arena, and he is reluctant initially to give Mickey a rematch. Later, the tough-minded Mason learns to his surprise that Mickey served under him in the Gulf War as a valiant Marine sergeant who refused to abandon the body of a slain comrade shot by an enemy sniper when their Abrams tank struck an IED. Ultimately, Mickey must endure blood, sweat, and tears with a couple of horrific reversals that prove as shattering as they are tragic. "Born A Champion" amounts to Flanery's unabashed 'love letter' to jiu-jitsu, and director Alex Ranarivelo has fashioned one of the best jiu-jitsu movies ever."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10661710/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," the more it breaks genre, the more entertaining it gets ","The script is so ambitious that it never settles on a single theme for more than a few minutes. Equal parts sports drama, MMA, romance, inspirational, motivational, and yesterday's lunch. Strangely it is precisely this lack of traditional story-telling -- an anti-Rocky if you like -- that keeps it interesting. Flanery, softspoken and sincere, is perfectly suited to ground the effort, and Alex Ranarivelo has the solid skills needed to keep things moving. The audience never gets quite what it expects -- the ending makes that more than clear -- and therein lies its charm."

It had it all - drama, sport, mma action, family, romance, etc. And in the way it was shown - part Lifetime Movie style and part Documentary, worked perfectly. It lacked all the Hollywood dazzle, and that was refreshing for a change. I'm still not sure if this is based on a true story, especially when I recognized some famous UFC fighters in this film.Alex Ranarivelo directed, and also wrote this story with Sean Patrick Flanery, who also starred in this film. The cinematography was decent, as was the score. The pacing felt a little slow, and I feel if it was a little faster and/or 10-15 mins shaved off the 112 min runtime, it would've shown better. The story flowed really well, with some unexpected surprises and twists. It will fill you with suspense and play with your emotions. Performances were convincing, and it was good to see Mr. Quaid in this one.Overall this film was much better than I expected, and it's a "recommend", and I'll probably see it again. It's a well deserved 8/10 from me. To see my review criteria, or more of my 1000+ reviews, click on my username. Then go see this little gem.

This movie has the based on a true story feel to it, although I couldn't find anything saying that it actually was. Sean-who also shares a writing credit of the movie-plays an American that teaches Brazilian Jiu_Jitsu in the 1990's in California. Sean catches the eye of an Arab Sheik from Dubai that hires him to teach his son some moves-he even flies Sean in to teach. While in Dubai, Sean saves Katrina from Costas, a visiting unscrupulous businessman, and in the process, Sean falls hard for Katrina. Sean also gets involved in a MMA fight where his opponent cheats and beats Sean. Dennis plays the winners' promoter. Some resourceful people video taped the fight and released it, which caused many other people to demand a rematch, saying it wasn't a fair fight. Earlier, I said it feels like it was a true story. That's because they keep pointing out specific dates-I think the rematch was in 2001-and they tell what happened to certain people at the end of the film. I read that there were no stunt doubles used during the sparring and the fight scenes-Sean is a real Jiu_jitsu practitioner, which I did not know-so the fights look pretty authentic. It's rated "R" for language and has a running time of 1 hour & 52 minutes. I really liked this movie and I would buy it on Blu_Ray."

Its draw for me was, in fact, the very different manner in which this story is portrayed.

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10661710/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," VIEWS ON FILM review of Born a Champion ",""Protect yourselves at all times". Ain't that the truth. That's especially inherent when drawing bloodied hands in the realm of white-knuckle jujitsu. 2021's Born a Champion delves into this system of unarmed combat training. The film feels a little direct-to-video but in these trying times, what doesn't."Champion" is a violent sports drama. It is cut from original cloth and pigeonholed with a TV feel. It's not based on a novel or a magazine article but on a story concocted by its lead actor (Sean Patrick Flanery). As something about an American black belt fighter who seeks revenge on another fighter who almost ended his life, Born a Champion is akin to a jujitsu version of Rocky (or any of its sequels). The main character is even named Mickey and he's got a "cut" about his eye. Natch.Born a Champion saddled with good intentions, does a lot of research in regards to the art of jujitsu fighting. And I'm sure star Sean Patrick Flanery had a lot to do with it. As grappling brawler and family man Mickey Kelley, Flanery completely disappears into the part. We're talking a change in voice, a change in weathered appearance, and a change in body type. Sean channels his inner Mickey Rourke here because he almost looks the way Rourke did in the late 80s (or early 90s). This is not the same guy I remembered from Powder, Suicide Kings, or 1999's Body Shots.The fight sequences in "Champion" are adequate, the locales are isolated, the direction by Frenchman Alex Ranariveto is standardized and scorching, and the acting is a little C-list had it not been for Flanery's disciplined transformation (and Dennis Quaid's reliable supporting performance). Bottom line: Born a Champion's diegesis unfolds steadily like a blanket. It is good enough to not "tap out" early."

But I was so wrong, in the place of the usual hackneyed I'm tough I don't need to rely on anything smart of run or witty or anything that makes storytelling compelling and interesting experience owing to replacing everything for heavily induced action scenes for the sake of overly employing the ol' lets just resort to mad action scenes but usually that's fine but when there is nothing to tie the thing together in the inbetween then what do we have, what are we doing here essentially? But this, this had everything and way way way more! A true gem! And true talent all around, a true masterpiece and I can say that knowing I went in with preconceived ill notions and I was so wrong! and I can say that I not only loved this, I LOVED IT! cause I can't find another word for it! just such impressive writing all the way around and really cool everything else that makes for an enjoyable visceral experience! I so recommend this and I have to say fine job great job keep up the fine work and can't wait to see more hopefully from this combo writing and directing duo! Super cool and super cute and super intimate moments and the best part was it was all so natural and smooth and from teh beginning to the very end I was so gripped! I have never ever seen an action film that was written with this much intuitive creative talent behind the pen! Excellent job!"

He has worked in numerous movies but never rose to an A-Grade Hollywood actor. He gives a very convincing performance in the film.Dennis Quaid is the only veteran actor in the movie and my hero of many movies like Dreamscape 1984, Enemy Mine 1985, Innerspace 1987 among his many, many other movies.This movie concerns underground fights during the period when M. M. A. Was yet unknown. The fights were staged by powerful wealthy individuals and not made available to be seen by the general public.The fight scenes in the film are well choreographed and backed by some decent acting. In my opinion this is director Alex Ranarivelo's best work."

","So i didn't knew what to watch and had a look at new movies, i always enjoy Martial Arts movies, and i saw this, i was like alright ill give it a try. I am not Brazilian Jiu Jitsu's biggest fan as a Martial Arts in general, i mean i know its very effective but its not the best one to watch either on TV (UFC) or in movies, i prefer more flashy stuff like Muay Thai, Kickboxing, Wushu or Kung Fu. Yet this movie blew me away.The fights are very well done and they never bore you, main actor being an actual BJJ Black Belt, but they are not the main point of the movie, what really hook me is the story. This movie is filmed as if it was a true story (wich i don't think it is at all) and you really get into it, you feel for the main character and you actually wish this was a real story.Its really one of these movies that if the story wouldn't had been good, i would had probably negatively review it, because there is not a lot of fight, its more of a drama WITH fights in it. Kinda like what Rocky is to Boxing if i can say, altough there is a little more fights than the first couple Rocky movies. But since its well written and you do care for these characters and what happen to them, you really get into it. At least for me that was.Honestly if you remotely enjoy BJJ, absolutely watch it, if you enjoy Martial Arts, give it a shot too. Its only like 10$ Canadian on Xbox Marketplace and it has French audio too. Not that it matter for most of you but well ;)"

It looks realistic, although he is 55 years old in real life, in the movie he plays a much younger person, simply because he is so fit and looks much younger thanks to his lifestyle and... makeup. In terms of plot, you have seen it before in so many movies, but still, the cast brings all you can wish for, so if you like these action-drama-fighting movies you will be fully satisfied.

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10661848/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," A strictly average gangster comedy overly melted into foreign refugee drama. ","Jagame Thandhiram (2021) : Movie Review -Jagame Thandhiram gave all ideas about its lack of creativity from the trailer itself so expectations were not high. Well, it has helped to enjoy this average flick as Dhanush was coming after a high end Classic like 'Karnan'. Gangster film isn't anything new for Indian audience, we have seen almost all kinds of varities in it. So what was left for Jagame Thandhiram? Nothing, as far as mainstream filmmaking was concerned but for creative filmmaking there are always new ideas coming from genius filmmakers. So, Jagame Thadhiram uses all the old methods from multiple genres such as Gangster, Refugee Drama, Love Story and Crime Thriller and exports a regional local gunda to foreign land. If that's enough for you as something creative then you can be happy because there is nothing much left after that.So, the basic storyline is, A nomadic gangster finds himself caught between good and evil in a fight for a place to call home. Suruli, a local goon is hired by big foreign gangster to do a job for him. Interestingly, his target is from the same soil and same caste. Jagame Thandhiram has a decent storyline to keep you engaged for 2 hours out of 2 hours and 38 minutes runtime. These extra 30-35 minutes are the real culprits who kills the engagement of the film. On additional bash, all those twists are outdated and predictable. By the time you arrive at intermission point, you can easily guess the climax and its premises.Dhanush plays Surili very funnily actually. He didn't look like a dangerous gangster at all, don't ask why. We have seen him doing much much better in couple of Classic Gangster flicks of his. Aishwarya Lekshmi looks pretty, nothing great as an actor though. James Cosmo looks somewhat convincing as deadly villain, Joju George is brilliant as Sivadoss and other supporting cast members are okay. Jagame has got misfired explosion and even action scenes doesn't add anything useful. Dialogues are really good though, while cinematography and technical aspects are simply unnoticeable.Karthik Subbaraj isn't an extraordinary director to be honest, he lacks consistently in his filmography. So, It does not hurt much to see him doing mistakes. His ordinary vision to present things can be noticed easily in many scenes. But, he has really done a great job for some scenes, that credit he deserves along with smacking. There is no creativity or new sense of storytelling in anything. It's just the same repetitive stuff with new characters and new locations. A gangster film deserves to be looked from that one perspective only but with Jagame Thandhiram all the additional things like immigrants, love story and generosity fails to match up with the basic elements. Overall, it's a strictly average for Dhanush fans, others can skip it.RATING - 5/10*"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10661848/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," A thoroughly uneven gangster thriller with fun action sequences la Guy Ritchie & Tarantino! [+53%] ","The real star of Jagame Thandhiram is Santhosh Narayanan. Whether it be the peppy Rakita Rakita or the badass Naan Dhaan Da Mass, or the scintillating score with absolute bangers like Suruli & Barotta Master, the soundtrack is superb. Jagame Thandhiram seems to have been made with the sole intention of Karthik Subbaraj wanting to stage those Tarantino-inspired action-heavy scenes during the climax - featuring dhoti-clad Madurai-bred gangster Suruli (Dhanush) gun-battling white supremacist Peter (James Cosmo). On paper, this is a splendidly creative thought. But the journey of getting to said climax is such a chore. The butt-numbing length (2h 38m) only adds to viewer woes.Subbaraj, like most of his predecessors who have attempted gangster actioners, tries to bite off more than he can chew. The second half takes up the immigrant issues faced by Sri Lankan Tamil refugees, adopting a more serious tone to proceedings. It never feels as fulfilling as watching a Petta because the ambitions are higher but the execution isn't. The characterizations are odd and thin - if all it takes for a no-nonsense rowdy who specializes in the manufacture of crude bombs to turn into a saviour of sorts is an emotional backstory told in a 15-minute flashback, it can never be convincing enough. Cosmo seems to be enjoying playing a baddie, as he goes delightfully over-the-top in most of his scenes. While Joju George's character Sivadoss is pivotal to the plot, the character lacks any real punch. The only thing we get to know about him is that he's a gangster with heart.Dhanush handles the role of Suruli with consummate ease, switching from a local Madurai thug with cooking skills to the trigger-happy London gangster. As a character, it's tough to root for the guy because he's not only arrogantly self-indulgent but also extremely weak-willed. He's defined by swagger alone, not memorably written scenes. Another notable drawback is the (almost subtitle-like) English dialogue - it's something most Indian filmmakers are yet to crack, especially when they set their story abroad with key English-speaking characters. The final shootout sequences are a scream, however, crafted in signature Subbaraj style. This is also where the "loose cannon" aspect of Suruli vividly comes across. Much of the film is a series of hits and misses though; the latter a bit more prominent."

"," Review Of Jagame Thandhiram, Out On Netflix: Karthik Subbaraj's Guy Ritchie Swagger Cannot Save This Ambitious, Messy Dark Comedy ","Back when Jigarthanda released, almost seven years ago, Tamil cinema was a very different place. The Internet was slower and more expensive, Netflix hadn't entered our markets and we were just being introduced to our first batch of filmmakers who had graduated from The Tarantino University with a Masters in Style and Irreverence from The Guy Ritchie School. Most of us had already seen gangsters (and films) behave this way but never in a Madurai setting. So, when Assault Sethu uses a bloody sword to cut his birthday cake, or when Rolex Rawther (Jil Jung Juk) literally runs out of 'time', we were being seduced by the novelty of Tamil sensibilities mixing with a borrowed-yet-attractive filmmaking style and visual language."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10661848/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Heat of style evaporates substance ","This felt like Michael Bay movie, which for the record, I enjoy a lot. But coming from Karthik Subbaraj this was not expected. Let's break it down.First of all the style, action and sequences were very 90s and amazing. Dialogues were punchy and effective. All the gang meeting and shooting scenes were expertly choreographed and homages or inspirations were clear. Overall it's a great movie to watch for timepass and that's the problem. Trailers had ruined half the movie. You can predict what's next. The big twist in the middle is supposed to make you feel something but the character choices feel unrealistic.Second half story takes an unbelievable turn which feels very odd when you think about the characters you saw during the first half. The whole immigrant issue in backdrop is supposed to make you feel emotional but becomes just a tool to further the story. It seems like the writers didn't know what to do with all the heavy objects they lifted in the first half of the movie.In the end as a popcorn flick this was solid. But as a Karthik Subbaraj movie this feels like he was given money to spend and he just did that mindlessly not caring about his audience."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10661848/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," Bad Movie?No. Good movie. Naah.. ","Jagame Thandhiram was Karthik Subbaraj's Dhanush led film with a predictable/age old story of an anti hero, guilty of his actions turns into a saviour of the weak. Except Dhanush, nothing in the film is enjoyable other than unseen locations and cinematography at times.The politics told in this film is a very relevant one. Not much portrayal of Sri Lankan tamils have been done on screen. The people with no where to go and no land to own is a very helpless situation especially when they're branded as terrorists.Nothing else in this film is worth the time of almost 3 hours which feels like a torture after an hour into the film, especially the laggy scenes, slow edits, and a very unimpressive music score which doesn't add anything to the screen.Overall- Below average. Watchable if you've 3hours to kill. It ll be surprising if you don't fall asleep in between.Karthik, the man who made Jiggarthanda must've ran out of his gangster stories to tell. He really needs a refreshing plot devoid of goons and guns to stay interesting. Else he d be another of the great director turnt monotonous category."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10661848/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," Not logical but enjoyable. ","The film starts and stars local goon, Suruli from Madurai, played effortlessly by Dhanush. His car comes and lands on a a plain better railway tracks and then disappears. Start is shaky but it then picks up just like we all pick up a pack full of air.. Oops chips in a supermarket.The white guy looks like KFC colonel Sanders enough of our stupid and non real interpretations of foreigners. Just naive. Amidst all the gang gang games, comes usual twists.After watching Family Man 2, this movie shows light to Srilankan history and refugee crisis. Family Man 2 does make a mark of reference within us.The film eventually talks about emigrants sculls out a messiaha for them.There is nothing new in Karthik Subbaraj's Jagame Thandhiram that you would have not seen or felt before. Just watch fir plain entertainment in with Netflix.The real problem with movies like these is that the climax comes in the second act itself and thereafter the film is kinda irrelevant with all the mellow drama with altering of hearts and changing of attitude. What was right first becomes wrong and the vice-versa.Lazy attempts at few places. Also screenplay was not rocksolid. Apart from all this it's still not bad and quite enjoyable. Less songs help.Aishwarya Lekshmi does good and Dhanush fans will gi crazy over this but it is almost 3 hours long so be prepared with "Parotta's" (you will know why) and curry and dive into both movie and parottas. Movie available on Netflix and Parottas on Swiggy/Zomato or just order iD Parrottas from Groceries delivery otherwise easily available at any store."

I did love all thatThe beats and scores were another positive that kept me hooked...sick and energeticThe songs were good and well placedOverall its a movie that hardcore DHANUSH fans will welcome with open hands but not sure about others For me apart from the acting and cinematography and scores...I didn't care much or nothing else had my attention apart from those points i mentioned aboveAN AVERAGE ONE TIME WATCHABLE IMOFor me it's a 6.5 /10 the extra .5 is for the CINEMATOGRAPHY."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10661848/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Too simple execution - watchable ","In Jagame Thandhiram, directed by Karthik Subbaraj, the ruthless gangster Suruli (Dhanush) gets involved in the gang warfare between Peter (James Cosmo) and Sivadoss (Joju George), but his ignorance gets him into a bigger conflict. The movie is definitely meant as a theater entertainer experience, while at the same time it tries to convey the aftermath of the civil war in Sri Lanka. Even with low expectations, it was just watchable for me and it's my least favorite Karthik Subbaraj movie so far.What seems to be a great story on paper with enjoyable characters gets lost in a rather lazy and incomplete execution. What made the movie watchable were some great dialogues (even the English - Sri Lankan Tamil at least better than the usual standards). Subbaraj always had a touch of Tarantino; in this movie it was more obvious and I enjoyed it. Some performances elevated the simple characters as well as possible, too. James Cosmo and Joju George might have even saved their characters.Yet it didn't help to cover the incompleteness of the plot - mainly due to the lack of story and character depth. Instead of exploring the different subplots and characters, the narrative forcefully focused on Suruli. Not only did this create many plot holes, but in many scenes the story failed to convey the feelings of the characters authentically.It has to be noted that in technical aspects Karthik rediscovered himself. Some of these technical decisions were interesting, yet they were very confusing to me - over-produced. Sadly not even Santhosh Narayanan's score clicked with the visuals, though it sounded good. Another big disappointment was the action - kinda felt like the mix of Hollywood exaggeration and Kollywood exaggeration.Overall Jagame Thandhiram is not what it could've been. I don't think it's a bad movie - just way below the standards of the people involved."

It will become a blockbuster and hope the makers confirm it will have sequel. Although the Netflix version did not have Bujji, Aala Ola and Nethu, those three songs will come during television premiere and I am waiting for it. Even though I gave criticism for mostly angry scenes in Karnan, I like the soundtracK and hope Jagame Thanthiram will become blockbuster.However ,the movie has two versions:Actually the Netflix version has a duration of 158 minutes with an 18+ rating (A certificate) because of violence and abusive words, three songs and sequences were removed to follow the platform's guidelines.But the televised version has a duration of 165-168 minutes which included deleted songs and sequences and also censored or bleeped the violence and abusive words.I think the televised version is more better than the Netflix version. Hope they will like the televised version.1st half is good and interesting but the 2nd half is awful and disappointing.Hence, the film is not awful and must watch for Dhanush fans.DHANUSH ROCKS!!!!"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10661848/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," NOTHING - FOR ALL THE HYPE IT CREATED ","Karthik Subbaraj's Jagame Thandhiram finally came out after more than a year of anticipation.The movie consisted of a cast which gave huge hope for both the fans of those actors and the writer-director Subbaraj. The film is starring Dhanush, Joju George, Aishwarya Lakshmi and also James Cosmo the British actor known for playing the role of Ser Jorah Mormont the Lord Commander of the Night's Watch in the commercially and critically acclaimed HBO TV Epic Drama series Game of Thrones, Academy Award winner film Braveheart and 2004 film Troy starring Brad Pitt.Despite having a great cast of all these actors the movie fails due to the screenplay which is written in a very flawed and cliche manner.The screenplay is littered with countless unnecessary scenes and trash cliche elements which bores the hell out of the viewer. It has a politics which is relevant but written in an idiotic way.The protagonist Suruli(Dhanush) is a restauranter and local goon from Madurai, Tamil Nadu, India. A white gangster and racist in London - Peter Sprott(James Cosmo) faces huge problems from a Tamil gangster named Sivadoss(Joju George). To eliminate Sivadoss from Peter's list of enemies he decides to hire a Tamil gangster. Peter found difficulty in tackling Sivadoss, so he thought that a Tamil gangster will be great for the elimination of Sivadoss because he will be able to understand Sivadoss psychologically. Never expected this kind of writing from Subbaraj.Finally, Suruli comes to London and successfully tackles Sivadoss and puts an end to his criminal empire. As a reward, Peter gives Suruli an entire street and allowed Suruli to do whatever he wanted. Suruli made that street his Little Madurai.After a while, Suruli realises the white supremacist agendas of Peter and sets out to put an end to him.The movie raises it's voice against a huge global problem. The issues faced by immigrants, the discrimination and racism they face, nativism and xenophobia. But all this are not written properly! In the beginning the screenplay consisted quirkiness but as the story progresses, Suruli has a change in his mindset, to express that the writing was focused on melodrama. One major problem it had was extreme cringe. Secondly, it was completely unnecessary. The writing should have been in the way how it was in the beginning. The melodramatic scenes were just cliche which could be seen in almost all of mainstream Tamil movies. The writing was focused more on telling instead of showing. It simply demolished all the fun. Performance was also trash. The cause of Suruli's change in mindset was due to something which his lover(Aishwarya Lakshmi) did to him. After that incidents she explains a lot of things to Suruli. When you see it you will be bored and cringing out at the same time. It's written in such a way that's so cliche, something which we have seen since decades.The other major problem in the screenplay is the drag which was created due to unnecessary scenes and dialogues which didn't create a grip on the viewer.Above all this, Joju George and Aishwarya Lakshmi were a miscast.Still there are some positives in this film, the action choreography, Background score, cinematography and color grading were all very good. The style of cinematography and color grading were top-notch and something which is unfamiliar in Tamil cinema.Santhosh Narayanan's Background score was exceptionally amazing. It was simply on another level.The direction also didn't have much flaws.Dhanush as usual, was stellar with his performance.Not recommended, it's a disaster."

There is little to none here, the focus being the Kills (duh, I know, the title is sort of a giveaway, right?). But it is not just the Kills, it is all the small roles from the Original finally getting their 15 minutes of fame - though for some it is way less than that.Now if you suspend your disbelief enough (especially when it comes to what makes sense or not, like how the Killer looks and who is being chased in the Hospital to name one example), you are going to be able to be quite entertained by this. It is a fan service - but it also may dissapoint some fans. Especially those who are here for Jamie Lee Curtis character - she is quite passive in this movie to put it mildly.That being said, there is enough tension here and the violence level is as high as any horror fan would wish it to be. There is even a scene with firefighters (and another one later on), that may remind you of action movies rather than horror. Still it works and the stunts and effects are as good as they can get.Giving us a motivation for Myers is kind of a risk - even more so, because apparently that does not involve Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis) ... even if a sequel was not already announced, you'd know there is never an end. Even if there is one ... don't be mad at the characters here who seem oblivious to that fact ... even if they sort of come up with an explanation for the "unstoppable" force that is Michael Myers.A lot of throwbacks and winks to the fans of the original, starting once again with the opening credits.

The core of the film was as you would expect, lots of gore, lots of violence, and the ending was again a mix of good and bad. It didn't have much in the way of suspense.The only upsetting death here for me, was the suicide, that was about the only time the screen went silent, it was a very upsetting moment.My favourite characters were Big and Little John, those guys were really good fun.It'll have its fans and its haters, for the season it's a thrill ride, does it enhance The Halloween catalogue, sadly not, it lacked structure, it lacked a cohesive narrative, it was just a killing spree slasher.6/10."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10665338/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," Halloween Kills ","The previous film, a reboot disqualifying all events from previous sequels, was a great return to form for the franchise, this follow-up was delayed by a year due to COVID-19, so I was hoping it was worth the wait, directed by David Gordon Green (Pineapple Express, The Sitter). Basically, it opens with a flashback to 31 October 1978, the police are on the hunt for murderer Michael Myers (Nick Castle, the original Michael from 1978, and James Jude Courtney). Michael is cornered when he returns to his childhood home, but Deputy Frank Hawkins (Thomas Mann) accidentally shoots his partner dead while trying to save him from the killer. Michael is eventually caught, surrounded by many officers outside the house, and is incarcerated for forty years, until his escape. Returning to the present, Halloween night 2018, teenager Cameron Elam (Dylan Arnold) finds the dead body of Dr. Ranbir Sartain and calls an ambulance for Hawkins (Will Patton) who was left for dead after Sartain stabbed him. Meanwhile, Tommy Doyle (Anthony Michael Hall), who witnessed the attacks of Michael Myers in 1978, is in a bar with fellow survivors Marion Chambers (Nancy Stephens, reprising her 1978 role), Lindsey Wallace (Kyle Richards, reprising her 1978 role), and Cameron's father, Lonnie Elam (Robert Longstreet) to celebrate the 40th anniversary of Michael's imprisonment. Meanwhile, Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) has escaped the house fire with her daughter Karen Nelson (Judy Greer), and her granddaughter Allyson (Andi Matichak). Firefighters responding to burning house unknowingly release Michael, who slaughters them with their own equipment. The trio are taken to Haddonfield Memorial Hospital, where Laurie undergoes emergency surgery, while Michael continues his killing spree while heading back to town. Tommy, Marion, Lindsey, and Lonnie hear of Michael's return from an emergency news report. Bar patrons Vanessa (Carmela McNeal) and her husband Marcus (Michael Smallwood) supposedly encounter Michael in her car, but the unseen driver escapes unnoticed. Tommy forms a mob of vengeful Haddonfield residents to hunt down and kill Michael. Karen is informed that Michael is still alive but hides this from Laurie to allow her to recover. Allyson reconciles with Cameron, her ex-boyfriend, and she joins Tommy's mob to avenge the death of her father. Laurie and Hawkins both awaken in the same room and reminisce about their former relationship. Hawkins admits that he regrets not allowing Dr. Sam Loomis to execute Michael given the opportunity and vows to kill him. While warning the Haddonfield community to stay inside, Marion, Vanessa, and Marcus are killed by Michael. Lindsey escapes and is found alive by Tommy, Lonnie, Allyson, and Cameron. The group map out Michael's path and deduce that he is heading towards his childhood home. Tommy takes Lindsey to the hospital and reunites with former Haddonfield sheriff Leigh Brackett (Charles Cyphers), whose daughter Annie was killed in 1978, and informs Laurie about Michael's survival. Michael's childhood home is now owned by gay couple Big John (Scott MacArthur) and Little John (Michael McDonald), Michael breaks in and murders them. While Laurie tries to leave, convict Lance Tovoli, who escaped Smith's Grove Psychiatric Hospital following the bus crash, and stole Vanessa's car, arrives at the hospital. The scared criminal is mistaken for Michael, Tommy's mob pursue him through the hospital, but Karen realises that he is not Michael. Despite her attempts to calm the mob and help Lance, he jumps out a window to his death. Tommy and the mob realise that Michael has turned them into "monsters" themselves because of their rage for his crimes. Laurie urges Karen to work with Tommy and Brackett to hunt Michael down. Elsewhere, Lonnie heads in alone to Michael's home and is killed. Allyson and Cameron also turn up and find Lonnie's body, and Michael attacks them, murdering Cameron. As Michael prepares to kill Allyson, Karen stabs him in the back with a pitchfork, steals his mask, and taunts him to follow her. She leads Michael towards Tommy's mob, who swarm, attack, and seemingly kill him. When the mob disperses, Michael recovers and massacres the entire mob, including Tommy and Brackett. Back at Michael's home, Karen finds Allyson who needs medical attention. Michael appears and stabs Karen to death in Judith Myers's old bedroom as Laurie stares out of her hospital room. Also starring Jim Cummings as Pete McCabe, Brian Mays as Brian the Bartender, Omar J. Dorsey as Sheriff Barker and Tom Jones Jr. As Dr. Samuel Loomis (a spitting image of Donald Pleasance). As before, Curtis goes from post-traumatic stressed victim to determined fighter wanting to end the maniac's reign of terror, and the indestructible killer is menacing enough. The previous film felt a bit fresher and more exciting, whereas this follow-up feels a bit samey, using the same predictable formular and slightly silly dialogue as past instalments, at least the over-the-top violence and inventive kills work well, and the fear of the people having consequences stuff is interesting, all in all, it is an alright slasher horror. Worth watching!"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10665338/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","1"," David Gordon Green sticks the knife in and twists it. ","Those who thought that Rob Zombie was the worst thing to happen to Halloween, think again. David Gordon Green is the new boogeyman, out to terrorise fans of the original film with his atrocious approach to all things Michael Myers. I thought that his Halloween (2018) was pretty bad, but this follow up is an absolute travesty: the tone is all wrong, the dialogue is laughable, and the acting sucks. Sure, it features plenty of gory kills - and god knows, I love my splatter - but Halloween has never been about the gore. It's about atmosphere, palpable suspense, sheer terror, with believable characters you can care about. And Halloween Kills has none of that.Following a flashback to the aftermath of events in Carpenter's original classic (complete with CGI-enhanced Donald Pleasence lookalike), the film picks up immediately after Green's previous film, Laurie Strode and family driving away from the burning house in which Michael is trapped, presumably gone forever. Except that Michael never dies, and when a firefighter crew turns up to tackle the blaze, the killer emerges from the burning building to slaughter the lot of them.From there-on in, the film consists of a series of graphic murders at the hands of the 'boogeyman', resulting in the townsfolk of Haddonfield declaring enough is enough, and forming a mob to track down Michael and put an end to his grisly shenanigans once and for all. Don't they ever learn? Writer/director Green, once again assisted by Danny McBride, fills his script with characters who act and talk like idiots, and frequently places them in perilous situations from which they could easily run away, but never do. There are numerous touches of comedy throughout, none of which has any place in a Halloween movie. There's nothing funny about Michael!Jamie Lee Curtis is given nothing to do but pontificate from a hospital bed about the nature of evil. She's not alone: several characters expound long, boring and completely unnecessary theories about why Michael kills, when all we need to know is that he is pure, unbridled evil. It's been said before, and doesn't need expanding upon.There are so many awful scenes in the film that it's a tough call to pick the worst...The gay couple (who call themselves Big John and Little John) checking their house for an intruder is a serious contender, especially when the second bloke (Big or Little... I can't remember) spots Michael and just stands there waiting to be killed.Or could the lousiest scene be the attack on the car in the park, in which Michael kills one of his victims by kicking the car door, causing the person to shoot themselves in the head (it actually pains me to type that!)?Or does the film hit its nadir when Tommy Doyle (an embarrassingly bad performance from Anthony Michael Hall) rallies the masses in the hospital into finding and killing Michael? The crowd, chanting the slogan 'Evil dies tonight' ad nauseum, spots one of Michael's fellow escaped lunatics (who just so happens to wander into the building at the wrong time) and assume he is the killer. They chase him and trap him in a corridor. Terrified, the loony smashes a window and falls to his death on the concrete below. It's a terrible scene that adds nothing to the film except for the messy sight of a smashed body on the ground.In another ill-advised move, Green tries to placate long-time Halloween fans with nods to previous movies, the most obvious being the inclusion of the deadly masks from Halloween 3. It's not a clever touch: it's just a reminder that even the much-maligned (unfairly so) Season of the Witch is a far better film than the one we are currently watching.The movie's ending - another possible choice for most ludicrous moment - sees Tommy and his chanting followers finally cornering Michael and bludgeoning and stabbing him, then turning their back on him, only for Michael to stand back up and get in a few more kills before the closing credits. It's bad, not only for the way that the people allow themselves to be slaughtered so easily, but for the fact that it heralds another sequel: Halloween Ends, coming October 2022 (how I hope that the film lives up to its title).1/10 - I don't hand out the lowest rating lightly, but the way this film trashes the legacy of the original movie, it deserves it."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10665338/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","3"," Well, the music score is nice... ","Follow-up to, among other films in the canon, 2018's "Halloween", again directed by David Gordon Green, rather adroitly ties in flashbacks to--and new events from--that film and John Carpenter's original "Halloween" from 1978 (with Donald Pleasence lookalike Tom Jones Jr playing Dr. Loomis). Haddonfield survivors from '78's rampage band together with the 2018 characters to take down boogeyman Michael Myers, who somehow escaped the fire set by Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) in the last installment. But what begins as an interesting concept soon turns into yet another illogical hack-'em-up, with Michael's victims acting like foolish sitting ducks (in a ridiculous sequence, Michael eliminates each member of a firefighting team--one at a time, because that's the way they do things in these movies--leaving the whole crew decimated). Curtis, recovering from surgery at Haddonfield Hospital, consoles a wounded police officer who blames himself for Michael's killing spree (seems he stopped Loomis from shooting Michael in the head in 1978--but, since Myers "isn't flesh and blood like the rest of us", the conversation isn't useful or productive). When an angry mob finally encircles Michael and has him on the ground, one might think executive producers Curtis and Carpenter would be happy to call it a night...not in Haddonfield, it seems, nor in sequel-hungry Hollywood. *1/2 from ****"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10665338/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Sure, why not?... ","First of all, I must admit that I have never really been much of a friend of the "Halloween" franchise, though I have seen all the movies. Might seem odd, right? Well, you're right. Sure, I've seen all the movies as I do enjoy horror movies and slasher movies, but I've just never warmed as much up to "Halloween" as I did for franchises like "Friday the 13th" and "A Nightmare On Elm Street".So when this 2021 addition to the "Halloween" franchise was announced, I wasn't just exactly thrilled. But as I had the opportunity to watch it, of course I did sit down to do so.And sure, "Halloween Kills" is a watchable movie, and it certainly is among the better of the "Halloween" franchise since the original movie. But I have to say, though, that this wasn't a milestone in horror cinema by any account.The storyline told in "Halloween Kills" is adequate, although I found a bit unnecessary. But it made for adequate entertainment, given the sheer brutality of the murders committed by Michael Myers. And yeah, there were some pretty cool-looking kills in the movie, I will say that much. And those alone actually make the movie well worth watching.Sure, I was thrilled to have Jamie Lee Curtis return to the movie - yet again - but she didn't really play that much of a big role throughout the movie, so it was somewhat disappointing. But of course it was nice to see her in the movie, and she did add a good element to the movie. Judy Greer actually put on a good performance in the movie.Visually then "Halloween Kills" is top notch. It is a dark and gritty movie, and they definitely upped the game in terms of visceral kills that puts you right in the slaughtering gore."Halloween Kills" is a watchable and entertaining enough movie if you enjoy slasher movies, and it will definitely bring enjoyment to the fans of the franchise, of that I am quite sure.My rating of "Halloween Kills" lands on a six out of ten stars."

","Ah, had only the contents of the trail been a tease for the rest of the film, rather than a reasonably comprehensive depiction of the best bits! Regrettably, this is a pretty poorly stitched-together rehash of the original with a rarely seen Jamie Lee Curtis still on the hunt for the murderous "Michael Myers". He is still loose, and is wreaking havoc - but how can they they track him down and stop him? I have to say that by around half an hour in, I felt that with no notable exceptions, the entire town of gung-ho eejits deserved all they could get from their avenging tormentor. The "evil dies tonight" nonsense just made me cringe, almost as much as the truly mediocre acting on display; a script - pretty much entirely devoid of humour - that could have been written by one of his victims and an ending, well I am sure you can guess. There are the odd scenes that are gory, but for the most part it is a poorly assembled and structured story that culminates in a pretty risible last ten minutes. Sorry - I know this film will appeal to "Halloween" die hards, and I was delighted to see it play to an almost full cinema on a Friday night (I saw "Malignant" (2021) in the same screen four weeks ago all by myself), but it's really all rather a let down."

They have a point) survived, because of course he did(...well, no, I'm not complaining). Never underestimate the power of fan interest and profit motive. Once word spreads, so does a strong drive to stop him. This leads to armed mobs of civilians roaming the streets, trying to find and stop him. But are they actually counterproductive?Did they seriously try to put a message inside of a Halloween movie? Yes, and while I understand those who say that it ruins the film, in my opinion, it works more often than not. Unlike the 1980s, you can no longer simply do a slasher flick(a sub-genre that I continue to love) and expect people to be passionate about it; you have to be offering something else. The previous entry used an exploration of PTSD(which this tries to replicate, here expanding beyond the scope of one person and how that ruined her family, to an entire town, with mixed results) and a lot of elements that very heavily homage the 1978 original, to the point where its plot structure, among other things, is extremely similar. You can think of that one as proving to the fans that they share their love of John Carpenter's masterpiece, and that we should give them a chance with a more unique vision for the franchise. For my money, this one does do a largely great job at that. The fan service, however, is excessive, and often does more to hamper the overall effect than to improve the final result. Yes, bringing back so many of the OG cast members is impressive, no, sadly it did lead to this being overstuffed.I recommend this to huge fans of the two in the series that are in continuity with this, and make sure you watched them very recently, or you will definitely be confused. 7/10."

I was stunned. Opening titles, and then we go to the fire. Nice to see Michael coming out of the house, a bit exaggerated what he did with the fire brigade.Killings are messy and just on the edge of being gory but then it lost my attention a bit.

Nothing new, Michael Myers can't be killed, it doesn't matter if you stab him, shoot him, set him on fire, he just can't be killed nor injured. It's getting lame to be honest. Jamie Lee Curtis hasn't a huge role and that was maybe best like that. I hope this one was finally the last one because there's no milk to be milked anymore here."

","If like me and a fan of the "Halloween" movie series then you probably have seen "Halloween Kills", as it picks up and off after 2018's "Halloween". Really it's plenty of killing, rage, and blood and gore.You find Laurie Strode(Jamie Lee Curtis) in a hospital from her injuries and the film also does fine to flashback in time to show the past of other characters and how the story and saga has continued since 1978. As many clips and scenes are shown from Carpenter's 1978 original, the whole town is looking for Michael and blood and gore is spilled it's like you can't keep evil or the boogeyman down. Nothing great still it's a watch if your a fan of the series as the violence and evil blood gore does not stop with this horror legend icon in one Michael Myers."

Every time the make a great/very good ending, they botch it with the next installment. Halloween II (1981) Good, Halloween III (in comparison) Bad. Halloween 4 good, Halloween 5 bad. Halloween H20 good, Halloween: Resurrection bad. Halloween (2007) good, Halloween II (2009) bad. And Halloween (2018) GREAT, Halloween Kills...meh.Thanks to Peacock, I'm gonna rewatch this, probably this weekend. For starters, I just finished it and I'm puzzled on how this got made and need to see it again to figure out something, anything. Some clue on what the writers were thinking. It felt like there were 6 writers, none of which met each other followed by 6 editors who just lost their sight.When the movie begins there's a flashback to the original film and my immediate thought: well, that "looks like the classic, but doesn't feel like it at all. Clearly there were two different directors." As the movie progressed, I felt the same for the director of both Halloween (2018) and Halloween Kills....even though they are the same person, they looked the same, but felt wildly different.The same part I probably liked best: on how many characters they took from Halloween (2018) I wanted to see more of last time around and had such small roles beforehand. Honestly, I don't have too many more positives here. I think I'm giving it 3/10 stars because I'm biased for this series and characters and while it's bad, it's not Halloween: Resurrection or Halloween II (2009) bad.Hard to describe the plot, but it follows some of the subplots/locations of the original Halloween II, but mixed in a ton of III and 4. Michael's on his set path of destruction, Laurie did even less in the hospital than she did in 1981 and Dr. Loomis shows up and looked even more creepy than Carrie Fisher or Peter Cushing in Rogue One.I believe the next/final (ha) one is named "Halloween Ends." If this new trilogy decline in quality continues, I'm gonna HATE the series' climax. Recommended for EXTREME diehard fans and/or subscribers of Peacock.***Final Thoughts: Time to update the Best to Worst list:1 Halloween (1978) 2 Halloween (2018) 3 Halloween H20: Twenty Years Later 4 Halloween II (1981) 5 Halloween III: Season of the Witch 6 Halloween (2007) 7 Halloween 6: The Curse of Michael Myers (Producer's Cut) 8 Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers 9 Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers 10 Halloween Kills 11 Halloween: Resurrection 12 Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers (Theatrical Cut) 13 Halloween II (2009)"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10665338/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt"," Made Me Root For Michael Myers ","Completely clueless about what it wants to be or where its priorities lie, Halloween Kills is an absolute trainwreck of a sequel from start to finish. A dull, pointless & thoroughly frustrating entry that fails to capitalise on the blank canvas after the 2018 film wiped the slate clean by retconning the franchise, this latest instalment is an utter mess that's all over the place and unsure of its own identity.Co-written & directed by David Gordon Green, the story shift the focus on other survivors of Michael Myers' 1978 killing spree by sidelining our protagonist yet does it so awfully that we are never for once invested in the new characters. Green does the bare minimum to improve the ride, has no idea what tone to settle with, and branches the story out in directions that's neither warranted nor called for.It attempts to give us a peek of the trauma that Myers inflicted on not just Laurie Strode but the entire Haddonfield community and skims on mob mentality in dumb, facepalm-inducing ways. The film is devoid of tension, build-up & atmosphere, Myers' looming presence is also gone, and the narrative flow & editing is a nightmare. The only aspects working in its favour are the grisly kills & Carpenter's score.Overall, Halloween Kills features a healthy dose of gnarly kills & slasher brutality but the rest is not only underwhelming, it's almost cringeworthy. The callbacks are mere distractions, the subplots lead nowhere, performances are forgettable, and it really made me root for Michael Myers as he creatively slaughters a lot of stupid, annoying folks in this. A wasted potential at best, this newest chapter adds nothing to the saga."

I think they should not tell us they are making 3rd movie. This film is a filler.P. S : Of course people are (in the movie) are so stupid :)"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10665338/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," a plot ... ","Not easy to follow, jumps back and forth to the other halloween nights where mr myers have tortured this city. There has now been made far to many sequels to this mm caracter, maybe its time to give him the final push into the purgatory???But urban legends will survive nevertheless, and for the halloween industry ,flicks like this makes money in the cash register and sows fright and agony in every new trick or treat generation, i'm happy that the tradition is very sparse over here rural norway(its an urban phenomenon mostly)...theres nothing new here, some more gore and advanced special effects, but the idea is the same. So for me the grumpy old man the music will alwaysgive an adrenaline kick, the rest is just an average repeat of the past, just a could see film, cause there are better films on the present market."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10665338/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," Grotesque delight ","This sequel is exactly what I would want from a horror experience David Gordon Green directed a disturbing thrill ride for fans to enjoy! The music is perfect, the kills are brutal with exciting vibes, some of the humor is ridiculous yet excellent, and this is probably the most chaotic Halloween ever made and I'm ok with that. I'm so glad I got to see day 1 with a large audience that made everything more fun! Micheal Myers is a unstoppable force of evil that still has surprises."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10665338/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," Unnecessary... ",""Halloween Kills" is a Thriller - Horror movie and another movie of the "Halloween" franchise, in which we continue the story of Laurie Strode from the end of the previous movie. Michael Myers is again free and he is searching for his next victim.Since I had already watched all the previous movies of the "Halloween" franchise I knew what I was about to watch and there was not any surprise. The direction which was made by David Gordon Green followed the same pattern as the previous movies of the franchise without something new. For one more time the interpretation of Jamie Lee Curtis who played as Laurie Strode was very good but she was not as good as in the previous one. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Will Patton's who played as Officer Hawkins, Andi Matichak's who played as Allyson and Judy Greer's who played as Karen. In conclusion, I have to say that "Halloween Kills" is an average horror movie comparing with some of the previous movies of the franchise and I do not believe that it adds anything on this."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10665338/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Halloween Kills is thrilling but lacks everything from the first movie. ","3.5 out of 5 stars.Halloween Kills is a pretty fair slasher film that follows right after the last film. When Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis) thought she killed Michael Myers. He comes out of the burning house and is back on the killing spree. Tommy (Anthony Michael Hall) bands a community together to help and fight back. To kill Mike Myers once and for all.Halloween Kills is everything you can ask for a slasher film. Different in tone from the first film. This film has more of a bloody and gory body count. While the other movie had more of an intense thrills.What worked? Well Halloween Kills does have a lot more body counts deaths which you can expect for a slasher film. Check mark that off the list. Mike Myers walking in a path and killing anyone he sees. Breaking into peoples homes and slaughtering them. And posing the dead bodies in a disturbing way. Tommy who is a character from the original Halloween movie bands a community to help face the evil. With the help from other survivors from the original movie. This can only help set up a higher body count. Even during the climax of the film which becomes a blood bath.The cast ensemble was decent. Jamie Lee Curtis, Judy Greer, and Andi Matichak are back. Andi Matichak going with her boyfriend and his father to help hunt Myers down. Jamie Lee Curtis spends the whole movie in the hospital and sitting on the sidelines in this sequel for now. While Judy Greer is stuck in the hospital when chaos is breaking loose with people living in fear. And paranoia. Anthony Michael Hall is a new addition playing a previous character was a great addition.The music score by John Carpenter, Cody Carpenter, and Daniel Davies was great and menacing.What did not work? Like all slasher films and characters falling for the whole making stupid decisions and getting killed off. The previous sequel Halloween at least had a smart script which had characters trying to trap Myers. However, Halloween Kills falls for the characters making stupid decision. Everyone setting up for there own trap and getting killed. The script is filled with characters making dumb decisions and slasher horror movie clichs.The plot also felt like a middle chapter with setting up the after math of the movie. While making the community fall into chaos while Myers is back on his killing spree. Not really much is thrown with the plot. The one thing that was interesting with the concept is the theme of essence of evil with Myers about him transcending every time he kills. And his obsession with his old home. Without giving away any details.Halloween Kills is an okay sequel. The script fell into the horror slasher clich with a thin plot. While setting up for a third film."

It's hard to find a film you know nothing about, unless you stumble upon it in the darkest depths of Netflix, or, as in this case, you go to a film festival and essentially throw a dart at the schedule. THE SCOUT is a low budget indie horror film that's rough around the edges, but with loads of heart, great pacing, and a capable cast. Clearly put together by people who love horror films, it takes itself serious enough to be compelling, but not so serious that there isn't an abundance of well earned laughs. The male lead, Kenneth Guertin, is great as the film within the film's director (the look on his face when being turned down by an actor he wanted in the film over the phone, is priceless), as was the actress that plays the internet influencer - I'm sure we'll see more of their work in the future. This film reminded me of the days of video stores and making great B horror film discoveries."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10670858/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," Well made indie horror film worth watching! ","In the Halloween spirit, I was able to attend the October 21 evening of Screamfest at TCL Chinese Theater. I was pleasantly surprised with The Scout. The horror elements were well executed and strange as you would expect from a horror film. There was a good balance of gore and levity.The cast was great with some real stand outs such as Jeff, the director and Denise, the producer. Overall, it was a fun and entertaining movie."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10670858/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," Fun and Entertaining ","As with the other reviews I found the show to be a great mix of horror and levity. The plot was original and a fun concept. If you are looking for a low budget horror film worth watching The Scout is a stand out."
