"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11777920/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," This was fun to watch... ","I remember watching "Dogtanian" on the TV when I was about 7 or 8 years old, every Saturday and Sunday morning. But I must admit that I didn't know what there was a 2021 CGI animated movie in the works. I stumbled upon this 2021 animated movie by random chance, and opted to sit down and watch it with my son, and let he see something that I watched when I was buy a boy.It should be said that the 2021 CGI animated movie "Dogtanian and the Three Muskehounds" definitely was in the spirit of the 1981 animated cartoon, so it was somewhat of a trip down memory lane for me. And the storyline told in "Dogtanian and the Three Muskehounds" was enjoyable for both my son and I, so that was something great from writer Doug Langdale.The voice acting in "Dogtanian and the Three Muskehounds" was good, which is something of importance when you're watching an animated movie. I weren't familiar with anyone on the cast list, for better or worse. But I will say that the voice acting was suitable for the movie.The CGI art style was also nice. They managed to keep the style of the 80s animated cartoon, while adding an updated touch to it at the same time."Dogtanian and the Three Muskehounds" is enjoyable for old fans of the 1980s cartoon, just as it is enjoyable for newcomers unfamiliar with the characters and storyline.I am rating "Dogtanian and the Three Muskehounds" a six out of ten stars."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11777920/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," Very beautiful film ","This is what I wrote, watching Dogtanian and the Three Muskehounds:1) The Pink Away 2) The Pink Wheel-A-Bout 3) Purple (undertake-her) 4) PIP's introductionFollowing the list, that I assembled up above, what I realised had happened was that I'd come across an AIA vs UUCU tradition (or, if not tradition, a 'dog'mate of meta)UUCU stands for uniformity, uniformity, contrast, uniformity. AIA stands for anti, intellect, anti, which basically means a roadtrip/slingshot for a central force, who is guarded by two anti's on the former's path to doginance.During the screening, I also added -AIA = all for one UUCU = suggesting OCD/"suggesting overdone" (quote by Aramis)So, as for PIP themself:It's better to be a co-UU in PINk, than to be late to the part-(wh)y.

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11777920/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","3"," Really not sure who this movie is aimed at ","I took my kids to see this at the cinema, having never seen the original. The animation quality was poor especially considering it was shown in the cinema. The language they used to tell the story went straight over my kids' heads so it was difficult for them to follow and most of the characters lacked personality. We were all utterly bored and glad when it was over."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11777920/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Classic brought to new audience ","It must be difficult to remake something for the modern age something that was produced 40 years ago with the common techniques, styles of the times and for the typical audience. The world has moved on, the risk is to make something new for the modern audience that the older audience will hate. This film has done a remake but with a nods to the classic. The 1980's version was a version the classic Dumas story made child friendly at the time, and this it what they have done again for a more modern audience. If you are a fan of the original look out for the dream sequences and watch all the credits at the end there will be things very familiar. If you are too young to remember the original take your kids for a treat and hopefully it will get them into reading books, as that was the effect it had on my back in the 1980's last time round.Lets hope that Apolo films get funding for remaking some of the other BRB classics."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11777920/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","1"," Worse animation than the 80s kids cartoon ","Ignore the obvious fake reviews from shills, the crude animation would have looked bad 20 years ago and the charmless 3d renditions of the characters have none of the personality or details of the 80s cartoon. Even the crappy clipart 2d animation flashback scenes are infinitely better than the awful, barely animated CG that looks like a student projectAs an 80s kid who loved the original I was nostalgia baited into watching this disaster and regret every minute. Absolutely unnecessary and a totally pointless remake that misses the mark in every way."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11788956/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","3"," It had the potential to be better... ","I stumbled upon the 2021 movie "Habit" by random luck. I must admit that I had never even heard about this movie prior to getting to sit down and watch it. So I wasn't sure what I should be expecting from director Janell Shirtcliff's movie.The movie's synopsis did, however, seem interesting enough. And I have to say that I initially felt like there could be a potentially enjoyable comedy here.And while the movie definitely has a colorful and interesting character gallery to offer the audience, I must admit that the movie was just lacking phenomenally in the story department. So writers Libby Mintz and Janell Shirtcliff just didn't manage to deliver a wholesome movie.The acting in the movie was actually adequate, and especially actress Bella Thorne was standing out in the movie with her performance in the lead part. Just a shame that the actors and actresses that participated in "Habit" didn't have a properly written script to work with.I managed to endure about an hour of "Habit", then I just couldn't sit through any more of the nonsensical storyline, as writers Libby Mintz and Janell Shirtcliff had be progressively losing me along the way as the movie trotted on and on. And truth be told, then I have absolutely no interest in returning to finish watching the rest of the movie as the storyline just fell short of entertaining me. And while the characters in "Habit" certainly were colorful, I must say that I just don't really care enough about them to want to return and suffer through the rest of the movie.Ultimately then "Habit" was a movie that had potentially more to offer, but was cut short by an inferior and awkwardly written storyline.My rating of "Habit" lands on a mere three out of ten stars."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11788956/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," blinded by the light... ","Habit is a visual mess of drugs, sex and psychedelia, spread allround in a very experimentally made film about an alternative lifestyle in the number one state of usa, california.its all about californication, where the path to a perfect life takes the easiest turn, namely the downturn spirraled direction. Its a film that loves to prvoce and deems to harras the social correct protocol of life, and religious impertinence is one of the methods to make this film become a commercial hit among the young and restless of the digitalized generation.Bella thorn, accompanied bytwo other sisters of the'' new age' generation of actresses, does fill this jive of earthbending harrasment with pretty bold and natural acting, and tries their best to make the provocing action look even better than the screenplay and direction does, so a small pluss for their efforts.Productionwise its a blended mix of films styles, reaching from kubricks a clockwork orange, to the crazy witchhunt of assassination nation, with colourshifts and psychedelic incitions of kaleidocsopical experimantation, filled with a score that will please only the chosen one( not me), using a self narrative way of telling the story, glued together by an editor without a leach, and the edition i viewed did not impress much on the sound quality...(yes, ive checked the sound settings of my system).So if youre a fainthearted religious person, take a halt before breaking the woes of never watching a silverscreen movie, because its provocative and graphic both physically and spiritually, for the rest its no more than ''you can try it'' movie. For a grumpy old man it becomes a bit to senseless, and i look forward to seeing ms thorne back in a sweet loved by all character in the near future. Snorting and going haywire aint that good for a long careere as an actress."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11788956/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","3"," VIEWS ON FILM review of Habit ",""Good day sir, so kind". Me, well I'm not gonna be so kind to 2021's Habit (my latest review). Habit is like a Gen X movie made with millennial-s (if that makes any sense). It's also over-stylized, over-directed, bible-thumped, full of itself, and pretty kitschy. It's as if rookie director Janell Shirtcliff dares you to hate it. Yeah I'm not joking here.So OK, Habit's plot is so murky I had to look it up on the flick's IMDb page. It's about a heroin addict who gets involved in a bad drug deal and poses as a nun to keep out of trouble (huh?). Habit paints helmer Shirtcliff as the poor man's Darren Aronofsky and/or the poor man's Terry Gilliam. The imagery here is striking and ornamented but the overall result is a hollow mess.Produced by over 20 people and clocking in at 81 minutes (that's with credits), Habit is a cinematic acid trip, the worst kind of trip. There's nutrition-less flash cuts, bad filler low camera angles, and even a couple of freeze frames (ugh). Yeah that's fine and dandy if you knew what was going on, you actually cared what was going on, and the troupers didn't come off as so darn irksome.Honestly I'd like to know what went down at the meeting when Habit was formally green-lighted. Did the studio execs think it might turn into a cult film? Maybe. Did they owe the filmmakers a favor or were strong-armed? Probably.Actors/actresses featured in Habit are Bella Thorne, Gavin Rossdale, Josie Ho, and Ione Skye. Throughout the proceedings they think they are being witty but they come off as total dolts. The dialogue given to them by Libby Mintz and Shirtcliff is so rife with annoyance it suggests an inner circle sitcom a la the Disney Channel (with profanities added). Um, please make a "habit" of never watching movies like Habit ever again."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11788956/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","1"," Making garbages is a habit I guess? ","Me if I see Jesus: yo what up JC!Bella Thorne as a theosexual. This has to be one of the dumbest movie of this year. I tried very hard to see this movie as a satire, but it's actually just stupid and nonsensical. Most of the time it's Bella Thorne going around saying "I love you jc" pretending to have a thing for Jesus. Ew like what the hell man. It's like watching those ecosexual communities where people try to have sex with nature. It's so gross and most importantly pretentious.Since Thorne produced this movie, I guess she thought that she was being clever, but she was just being cringe. Her acting along with the rest of the cast were horrible throughout. The dialogues were unbearable to listen to.Also, the movie tried to create a surreal and sexual atmosphere with the blurry and pink looks of the movie. There were scenes of characters getting high, which added more to the surrealism. I guess this made sense, but it doesn't cover how dumb the movie was.Overall, it's cringe and annoying to hear Thorne screaming she wanted to do Jesus. Also, I said "I guess" a lot because I had no idea what I was watching. I'll never get in the habit of watching garbages like this. 0.5/10."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11788956/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","1"," Do NOT Make Movies Thorne!!! ","This was just horrible. I saw it on the 17th but could not write a review until it released on IMBD. But I can see everyone felt the same way I did about it so no real loss there. Why anyone thought this would make for a good movie is beyond me! I liked the villain and her side kick cowboy but even they could not save this movie. Like I would really believe that everyone wants to jump Thorne's bones, even a priest was just laughable."

The movie is entertaining and does not deserve the very low ratings it has been given. Yes, it could have been better, yes it could have had a better script but Bella totally delivers in the character she has been given. So I have given it a 5.

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11788956/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","1"," Self-indulgent tripe, makes no sense ","I can almost guarantee that this concept was fueled by a weeklong coke binge party in the Hills by the group of friends who are in the movie, who wrote it themselves. The plot is idiotic, nothing is explained or even makes much sense and the actress playing the villain may be the worst acting I've ever seen. Good thing they got some CCP money to make it, probably because they were hot for Bella. Avoid like the plague.EDIT-I just realized that the CCP money probably came from a relative of the actress who is playing the villain, daddy (or whomever) bought her a movie woohoo! She is laughably terrible."

Like maddie is a devoted Jesus lover but not much of a christian. The first part of the film was comedic while middle part had a rock bottom moment and then it went action packed with a so so ending but amazing Performance from bella and Paris's first movie i think.

They have very loose tie-wraps on their wrists. Nothing looked realistic. Action scenes lacked a Liam Neeson hurt aspect.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11799110/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Almost maybe perhaps an OK film ... ","Rourke is the Bob Joyce of bad guys -- even pushing 70, he still gets the job done. Dennis Miller once said of Rourke, in a typically flamboyant role, "I wonder if Mickey even knows he is in a movie." Michael Jai White never quite got the career he deserved, and lately seems happy to underplay everything. His wife Gillian steals what is left of the film after Director Sesma misses countless opportunities to improve the pacing and audience interest. He somehow manages to make even sex traffiking seem boring. Could have been a contender."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11799110/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt"," Too much filler for the little substance of a generic story ","A typical low budget B-grade film that didn't offer up anything new. Producer and director Christian Sesma's directing was decent in some parts, horrible in others - Rourke's hair blowing like Fabio's in slow-mo, especially towards the end which had the lamest and most amateur trade-off/stand-off I've ever seen, it was laughable.This is the first ever writing credit for Zach Zerries, and it shows. It was riddled with plot holes, predictable, and omg some of the dialogue was horrid. There's a part near the end that Rourke repeated his line; why? I'm shocked that none of the producers including Rourke didn't give the screenplay a once-over to make some much needed edits. The normally comfortable 89 min runtime felt dragged out, and the slow pacing didn't help. There was too much nonsense filler, and the premise of the story needed more substance, and had someone added that to the script, this film could've been way better.Even the overall sound was bad, like everyone forgot to bring the boom mics up close, instead of hanging high up in the air. The cinematography was good, and the performances were actually not bad, considering Sesma clearly failed in directing his cast properly. Luckily he had some seasoned actors who pulled through, and the White's performances were the stand out for me. Even my boy Rourke seemed bored for most part of the film. Oh, and what was the meaning and purpose of his bandages lol? Sloppy writing, and lots of it. But considering it's from an amateur writer, the blame falls mainly on the experienced director being even sloppier and lazy at his job. A little effort could've gone a long way in this one. But as is, it's only a 5/10 from me."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11799110/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," Martial Arts Action Dud ","I saw "Take Back", starring Mickey Rourke-The Masked Singer_tv, The Expendables; Michael Jai White-Arrow_tv, Black Dynamite_tv; Gillian White-The Young and the Restless_tv, Jackie Brown and James Russo-Django Unchained, Open Range.This is a low budget martial arts action dud. I usually like martial arts movies but this one has bad acting and plot holes that you could drive a truck through. Mickey plays the villain and he is one of the worst things about this movie. His 'acting' is mostly just sitting around petting his dogs and trying to look villainous. Michael is a martial arts teacher that teaches his wife Gillian how to be a bad ass-she can even beat him up. Just in time, too, when she needs those skills to stop a bullying boyfriend from terrorizing a woman in a store. Gillian gets on tv and gets recognized by Mickey-they have a secret past connection-who sends guys to kill her. Gillian keeps maiming or killing the would be assassins which draws the attention of James, the detective investigating the cases. Sometimes, Mickey wants to kill Gillian and other times he doesn't-I said there were plot problems. There are even times when he could do things he earlier said he would do, and then he will just feed his dogs or just look off, menacingly.It didn't have a rating but it had violence, language and sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 29 minutes.It's not one that I would buy on DVD or rent, either. If you really want to see it, I would wait until it's on cable tv."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11799110/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," VIEWS ON FILM review of Take Back ",""Don't you remember me?" Ah when someone says that, it's never really a welcoming sign.Anyway 2021's Take Back is my latest write-up. By definition, the words take back refer to reclaiming possession of something. In the film Take Back, a married couple is trying to reclaim possession of their daughter who is being kidnapped by sex traffickers. Take Back is a shade watchable but it doesn't equal the intensity of the similar Traffik from three years ago. That flick involving the forced labor of women was pretty darn upsetting.Movie comparisons aside, Take Back is an action/thriller that has a little bit of both. It's a somewhat dangerous pic in which no one really feels safe throughout. There's plenty of hand-to-hand combat, a few remorseless killings, a couple of shootouts, and one proposed ego trip by Mr. Russell Jones (he acts as co-producer, extra, production designer, and art director).Yeah Take Back moves at decent clip and yeah, the acting is sort of amicable. But as Roger Murtaugh once said in an 80s action relic, the overall outline here is uh, "pretty thin".Take Back has a lot of brooding characters (with Mickey Rourke acting like well, Mickey Rourke) and everyone pretty much appears mean-spirited and nasty. But the filmmakers obviously didn't do enough research with the concept of captivity in cinema. The script by rookie Zach Zerries is pretty vague as it presents some holes in the so-called trafficking mythos. I mean not that I condone torment but those scenes are so quickly cut you don't know exactly what's going on.Bottom line: I don't want a "take back" so I'm going with a mixed review. Check out 2018's Traffik (mentioned earlier) if you haven't already. It just goes deeper down the rabbit hole of coercing and abduction. Furthermore, it does so without the inching folly."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11799110/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","1"," Pathetic ","Terrible acting for a start, unnecessary graphic shots of women obviously directed by a pervert, all the characters have no substance. Every scene with Mickey Rourke I found myself looking at his dreadful face surgery and not even paying attention to what was going on as it is that distracting. He plays a sex trafficking head honcho yet he can't afford a flat screen tv ???? The main character is displayed as a level headed woman yet she has a samurai sword on display in her house on a stand ??? It's a stupid film with stupid characters. A 15 rating just shows that the censors are not doing their job."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11799110/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," Elephant Man ","In seeing Mickey Rourke here in this movie, I realized that he could very easily star in a reenactment of the "Elephant Man." The production would be a lot less expensive due to the fact that Mickey would not need any special make up effects."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11799110/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","2"," Poorly crafted film is absolutely terrible. ","This movie is terrible for these main reasons.1. The heroine at the end shoots an unarmed man. The showdown between the heroine (Gillian White) and the villain (Mickey Rourke) was completely lame while a policeman and her husband watch it like they are at the theater sharing a bag of popcorn. She shoots the villain who does not have a weapon. Very anti-climatic!It also make the heroine a murderer.2. The husband abandons his daughter during an active shoot out so he can go watch along with the police detective, his wife shooting an unarmed man. Talk about irresponsible and bad parenting and reckless endangerment of a child.3. The villainess played by (Jessica Uberuaga) is in love with Mickey Rourke because he treats her like crap, uses her as a sex slave, had her chained up at one point of the movie, and will kill her if he gets bored with her. I guess people in love will do anything. I don't think anyone would understand the motivation of this female character. It makes zero sense.4. They make an effort to show how dedicated the police officer is in the film and how he cares only to have the Michael Jai White character say the police don't give a $#%^.5. At the end they don't call the police until the shootout starts even though they could have done it when they were going to have the hostage swap. Instead they rely on the sharpshooting skills of some redneck with rifle and scope that couldn't hit a bull in the backside with a hand full of cantaloupes. Insane!Was there a positive. I felt the lead Gillian White did okay and had some good action scenes at the start of the movie. The camera man had some excellent and scenic wide shots in the film."

The plot centres around Sidheeque (Mohan kumar), who demonstrates how difficult it is to remain in the film industry when stardom governs the business and the audience. Kuncako Boban and Mukesh have done an outstanding job with their respective supporting rules.Certainly, the film is worth seeing, and it is gifted with wonderful emotional moments as well as some humorous parts."

And this movie is just filled with positive content. The setbacks we could face in our life is reflected in the movie and just like in real life, our urge would be to give up without a fight. However, apart from usual tragedies, the movie focuses on overcoming every situation. Just like in real life, every character has had their setbacks, but still instills confidence in one another, when the time comes. The movie focuses on the plight of washed up actors, distributors/producers and hence brings their plight to light. This is exactly why I felt happy to have watched this movie. In a way, I felt I had contributed to them somehow. Its a family-drama movie, and a decent watch. -D. R. Adinath."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11800272/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Feel good movie ","This movie has an engaging script throught with a flat climax(negative part). But still this is a good movie to watch."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11800272/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," It's actually not a bad movie as it is made out to be ","I just saw this movie and the first thing I remembered was its review by Unni on Unni Vlogs that I had seen earlier. Unni is a good film reviewer, but I cannot agree with him on this. If you go to Youtube and watch his reviews of big brother and this, you will realise that knowingly or unknowingly he reviewed this movie to be as bad as big brother which it is not. Most of the other reviewers over here are also following his footsteps. Make no mistake, I am not saying this is a good movie, but even when you say a movie is bad, you have to correctly say how bad it is. Just because a movie doesn't meet your expectations, you shouldn't classify it as being not worthy of anything. Now coming to the movie, because of such bad reviews, when I started watching this post midnight, I readily expected to be asleep within half an hour, but surprisingly I was awake and alert till the end. There are three things or scenes in the movie that really pulls it down. Had it not been there, the movie would been satisfying to a lot more audience. First is that scene at the courier office where x meets y again, then Pisharody's scene towards the end and also Asif Ali's guest appearance as an angel. The contents of the letter towards the end and the message that it conveyed was a genuine feel good moment. That message is going to stay with me for atleast a week and hence I am giving this movie a rating of 7 that it deserves."

I'll say that the actors did a reasonable enough job, you did what was asked of you probably on the screen. But the reason why you chose to act in a movie with such a lousy plot is beyond me. Bobby-Sanjay has come up with a movie that is in shambles. The subplot of Mukesh being a movie producer and him going around to secure dates of actors - including Asif Ali (who does a cameo for 5 mins) is only there to increase the run time and waster the audience's time.You are treating your audience without respect. You are thinking we will be happy watching whatever crap you will film and put out and call it cinema. The number of songs in this movie is too many, if the movie does anything successfully, it is one thing - giving me a lot of confidence, that actors are now ready to take up any kind of scripts if there's enough money to throw around. You don't love the craft, you love the money - if that was another thing you tried conveying through Mohan Kumar Fans.Star studded cast and this is what we get. Crap. Don't waste your time.

Tamil audio w.Eng.subs. on Netflix. It is a faithful Tamilised remake of the wonderful Telugu film C/o Kancharapalem. In fact the Tamil title ought to have been C/o Meenakshipuram instead of Kaadhal (love) given the end scene where the entire village of M'puram come to the protagonist Palani's support, as in Kancharapalem.Anyway, C/o Kaadhal is a lovely simple film, narrated throughout in seemingly unrelated flashbacks and present moments. Having seen Kancharapalem I already knew the connections, which are revealed as a pleasant twist only at the end in both films. No spoilers from me as those who have not seen Kancharapalem will enjoy Kaadhal in their own way.Everything is ultra and mundanely realistic. The characters could be anyone you pass by in an unsophisticated setting. The acting by all is superb, the sets more than real ... did they take over a village in rural Madurai for the shoot? The direction and cinematography are superb. Bittersweet moments of lost love, acute tragedy in the death of the little boy's impoverished sculptor father, as with Salima, happier moments in between are all beautifully portrayed and so believably real.Summary: C/o Kaadhal is a wonderfully narrated, realistic film with a feel good ending.

She had been brutalized in a robbery a decade earlier and hates her husband's job as an amoral defense lawyer. He brings her to an isolated vacation home. He handcuffs her to him and shoots himself in the head. She's stuck with his dead body.The setup is too convoluted. The premise is that Mark had planned an elaborate scheme to set her up. It's way too elaborate when all he has to do is to handcuff her other hand to the bed. It's too much work for too little effect. Like Emma says, just call the cops and let them figure it out. It wouldn't make sense that she handcuffs herself to her husband without the key and then shoot him. No cop would even arrest her with that situation plus all the clue that Mark left. So the only good reason to Mark is to trap her with a dead body until she dies. A better way to achieve that would be to tie her down. (see Gerald's Game)Then the story has a lot of conveniences, some of which are kind of funny like lying down in the snow. Despite all the different problems, this is a fun little thriller. Megan Fox has done worst. It's unbelievable that she would let the bad guy live when she knocked him out with the golf club.

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11804152/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," A taut little thriller ","It is Emma and Mark's eleventh wedding anniversary. Things haven't been going for them lately but he takes her out to dinner, gives her a necklace then drives her to the remote lakeside house where they had happy times before. It looks as if he intends to try to rekindle their romance... until the next morning when she finds herself chained to him. Moments later he shoot himself in the head! She is miles from anywhere, the temperature is well below freezing and Mark has made sure there are no obvious means of breaking the chain or driving away. To make matters worse Mark has contacted a couple of brothers, one of whom has just served ten years for attacking Emma, and told them she holds the key to a fortune. It won't be easy for her to get away from them and avoid freezing to death.This might not be a great film but if you are looking for a taut ninety minute thriller you could do a lot worse. It starts off well and once we are at the lake house the tension rises nicely and peaks impressively towards the end. The frozen setting creates a great atmosphere and having Emma chained to Mark makes things more exhausting for her. The arrival of the brothers isn't much of a surprise and it must be said Emma makes some odd choices; it is a film clich that people being attacked don't finish the job when they first turn the tables on their attacker. The acting was solid; nothing to worry the Oscar committee but far from terrible. Overall I'd say this is well worth watching if you want a ninety minute thriller."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11804152/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Entertaining thriller... ","The 2021 movie "Till Death" definitely felt like a good old fashioned thriller, for better or worse. So if you enjoyed the thrillers from back then, then chances are you'll also like "Till Death".Sure, the storyline was predictable, but still it proved to be an entertaining movie to watch, as writer Jason Carvey managed to put together a wholesome movie. I was definitely entertained by what transpired in the movie, from the beginning to the end, despite of having figured out the ending of the movie well before due time.Megan Fox was pretty good in this movie, proving that there is more to her than just being a pretty face that stars in mindless action movies. Her portrayal of Emma in "Till Death" was spot on. And it was definitely a treat to have actor Callan Mulvey in the movie as well, because he always adds something enjoyable to the movies that he stars in, and he was rather nicely cast for the role of Bobby Ray."Till Death" does have some good and exciting moments throughout the course of the movie, despite being a somewhat predictable story.Director S. K. Dale's 2021 thriller is a movie that has contents to watch a single time, and that is about it. Yeah, I have to admit that, for me at least, then the storyline in "Till Death" just doesn't have any replay value.I was certainly was adequately entertained by what "Till Death" delivered.My rating of "Till Death" lands on a six out of ten stars."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11804152/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Dead Ringer ","Wives, imagine celebrating another wedding anniversary with your husband at a swanky restaurant. After you have dined on savory cuisine and sipped elegant wine, he walks behind your chair and drapes an exotic necklace at your throat. Later, he persuades you to don a blindfold because he has a surprise in store. You endure a tiresome drive into the middle of nowhere. The romantic lake house is straight out of Disney's "Frozen." Powdery white snow is heaped high everywhere, and the lake is iced over. Eventually, you follow a trail of rose petals lit by flickering candlelight to the upstairs boudoir. Awakening refreshed and contented the next morning, you watch in mute horror as your husband puts a gun to his head, pulls the trigger, and blood-splattered brain particles shower you! Of course, nothing like this would ever happen to you!Nevertheless, the ill-fated wife in this thriller, Emma (Megan Fox of "Jennifer's Body"), is devastated by her husband's suicide. Freshman director Scott Dale's "Till Death" (*** OUT OF ****) qualifies as a nimbly wrought nail-biter that conjures up suspense and intrigue galore throughout its gripping 83-minutes. Scenarist Jason Carvey, who wrote "A New Wave" (2006), has penned an atmospheric thriller that confines most of its action to a remote lake house after a brooding opening gambit in New York City. Emma's husband Mark (Eoin Macken of "Close") kills himself 23 minutes into "Till Death" and traps his woebegone wife in a house where she cannot find anything to remove her shackles. Before he killed himself, Mark admitted their marriage had fallen apart long. He admitted his philandering ways had driven Emma into the arms of another lover. At the same time, Mark had forsaken all sense of morality and steeped himself in corruption enough to prompt authorities to raid and ransack his offices.Mark is a 'piece of work.' Not only does he kill himself without a qualm, but he also leaves his unfaithful wife in a tight spot. The night they dined out, Emma had told her lover, one of Mark's colleagues, Tom Gorman (Aml Ameen of "Red Tails"), that she could no longer continue an affair behind Mark's back.Ironically, Mark qualifies as the "ball and chain" in their flawed marriage. Typically, this term applies to females. Here, the act of Emma dragging Mark everywhere gives new meaning to this phrase. Moreover, when she awoke, Emma had on a skimpy satin neglige, and the loss of heat in the lake house has put a chill in her marrow. Towing Mark's corpse around the house like a mule takes a toll on Emma. Her bruised wrist aches from the pain of her exertions. Later, she sprawls Mark on her wedding gown and finds it easier to haul him around the premises.Dale and Carvey have done an admirable job of painting our heroine into a corner. She is secluded in the middle of nowhere. Emma drags Mark's body outside and into the garage. She spots a hose sticking out of their SUV gas tank where Mark had drained off the gas! Earlier, she had struggled to use a soaked cell phone she found submerged in a flower vase. Mark's revolver held only one bullet, so she cannot obliterate the handcuffs. She curses Mark for the dastard that he is and this dire turn of events has her stymied. She is surprised when her former lover Tom shows up at the front door. Tom talks about the authorities ransacking Mark's office. Tom is stunned when he looks Mark's corpse on the wedding dress. While they are talking, an unknown vehicle wheels up in the driveway. Tom and Emma exchange suspicious glances.If Emma thought she was stuck between a rock and a hard place, she is alarmed by what happens next. Before they dined out, she spotted a dossier on Mark's desk about a low-life hoodlum, Bobby Ray (Callan Mulvey of "Shadow in the Cloud"), who had stabbed her in a street robbery years ago. Ray landed in prison for ten years. This happened before Emma, an amateur photographer, married Mark. Since he is no longer incarcerated, Bobby Ray has a score to settle with Emma. Mark has promised him $200 thousand in diamonds. Moreover, it also turns out this ex-convict gutted Tom fatally when he tried to run them off. Emma relies on her wits to elude Bobby Ray and his timid, safe-cracking brother, Jimmy (Jack Roth of "Brimstone"), and director Scott Dale stages a tense game of cat & mouse.Of course, Megan Fox is no Meryl Streep. Nevertheless, the "Transformers" actress has gotten older, and Emma is no idiot. Happily, she is an ordinary, down-to-earth, but troubled wife. She lacks the knack to unlock her shackles. Later, Emma musters unheard of ferocity when she clobbers Bobby Ray with a golf club and then locks Jimmy up. The dreadful predicament of our heroine inclines you to feel more sympathetic to her plight. Fox doesn't let her tantrums get out of hand during her moments of hysteria. Now, she faces a fate worse than death from wicked Bobby Ray. Callan Mulvey steals the last half-hour of "Till Death" with his electrifying performance as a pugnacious ruffian who wields a knife like a butcher. Ultimately, the villains catch Emma and stab her. Television lenser Jamie Cairney captures the action from a variety of angles. Although the setting is upstate New York, the producers filmed "Till Death" on location in Bulgaria. Altogether, this occasionally exasperating, often white-knuckled exercise in suspense will keep you on edge."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11804152/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," even as it is a simple story, it's full of suspense ","Remember the time that Megan Fox would be the next big thing. And sshe was on the way to become it until she made some fatal errors. From there on her Hollywood career was over but the horror genre picked her up. Jennifer's Body (2009) was her first entry in the genre and by a lot of geeks she became a new scream queen.Now she's back with Till Death. Starts off very slowly until minute 22. From there the troubles get in for Fox and she has to solve her situation.I can't say a lot because I would spoil it all. I found it an above mediocre flick, can't say it's a real horror but it do has some elements of it in it.The effects were also okay only the end is a bit exaggerated. Still, it's worth picking up. For me she Megan did a fine job. And the flick wasn't that bad after all, a lot of things I coudn't see coming.If you like suspense with some gory shots, pick it up.Gore 1,5/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 3/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5."

She gets roles because of her looks, which in my humble opinion are not that great like everybody else seems to think. The movie starts slow, borderline boring, but gets a kick in the second half, where there's actually some decent suspense. The story is not to be taken too seriously as there's no way a fragile woman like her could drag a dead weight like that without getting noticed. But there's some suspense, I'll give them that, but that's about it. Good enough to watch once, but you will forget everything about it the next day."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11804152/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt"," Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote. "," An Eye for an Eye ",""Till Death" began as a romance. It then turned into a thriller. It then morphed into the action genre. In the end, it can be described best as a horror film.The hodgepodge of styles detracted from the overall arc of development that was a brutal struggle for survival of the protagonist Emma Webster. When Emma Davenport first met district attorney Mark Webster in New Orleans, the "romance" was due to Mark's prosecution of Bobby Ray, the man who attacked and stabbed Emma. Emma and Mark were married, and now, years later, their marriage has soured.Emma has been unfaithful to Mark with one of his fellow attorneys, Tom Gorman. Tom is the most sympathetic character in the film, whose love for Emma appears genuine. Tom also makes a valiant attempt to rescue Emma from the diabolical fate planned by the vindictive Mark.Most of the action revolves around the lake house where Mark took Emma to celebrate their anniversary. Instead, the horror genre kicks in when Mark handcuffs himself to Emma, then shoots himself. We get to know every inch of that lake house."Till Death" was overly unpleasant with rarely any moments of levity. The characters were uniformly repellent. It turned into a ghoulish cat-and-mouse game when Bobby Ray returned to torment Emma. She had come close to gouging out his left eye during the New Orleans incident. The final touch will be for Emma to compete the cycle by gouging out the right eye.Some credit is due to the filmmakers for having a vivid imagination. But the lugubrious nature of the film will surely be off-putting to squeamish viewers."

This is fun thriller that I crave especially during the Halloween season and I'm glad I don't have to pay because of Netflix which I rarely use. Sure there's a few dumb parts but that doesn't make it as bad as some say not by a long shot! Megan Fox is great in horror she should do it more."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11804152/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Highly entertaining thriller ","There seems to be much backlash over this film and the character of Megan Fox due to her not cutting off her husband's hand using the vase or sharp edges from the picture frame. Where people rate the film low simply due to that.Otherwise Till Death was a lot better than expected and is far better than the current 5.8 IMDB rating.This film is carried by Megan Fox (one of her better performances- these are the type of roles she should be doing). What makes this film good is that it is quite simple and gets straight to the point. It isn't long and it doesn't drag. Also It is shot very nicely and the outside scenery is great to look at. Although somewhat of a predictable ending, it gets the job done."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11804152/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt"," Flawed, but also impressively put together by newb filmmakers. ","I must say, that the directing by S. K. Dale - in his first full length feature film, was outstanding. Then you have this film as the third ever writing credit by Jason Carvey. These two managed to give us an intense edge-of-your seat thrilling well paced 88 mins of impressive filmmaking, with what I'm certain was a low budget. They even managed to put some seasoned filmmakers' recent big-budget blockbuster releases to shame (e.g. Soderbergh's star-studded No Sudden Move). Mad props and respect to Dale and Carvey for pulling this little gem off so well.The story certainly wasn't perfect, and had some obvious plot holes and logical inconsistencies. But it was simple and very effective, and even managed to throw in some awesome gore. Although this genre has been overdone, this film will hold your attention and elevate your anxiety. The score and cinematography were spot on.Casting and performances were excellent and convincing. Fox seemed almost "too out of it" in the first act, and although it was meant to display her PTSD from a past incident, it felt more like bad acting. I'm sure it was from the lack of experience from Dale directing his cast properly. A rookie mistake, and it was less obvious as the movie progressed, so no real biggie. Fox's performance was outstanding, especially when the suspense began.But my biggest peeve though, was Fox's perfect hot-looks make-up throughout the entire film. Who said "make sure there's no blood close to her eyes so it doesn't ruin her stunning make-up"? I mean she looked like she walked off a fashion runway in every scene. Not a smear off her lipstick. That was annoying and ridiculous, and really took away the authenticity of her character rough scenes. I'm not sure if it's in Fox's rider to always look hot, but she needs to look like crap once in a while to fit her character, instead like a carbon copy of beauty since we saw her in the first Transformers.Maybe that was all these wannabe critics giving this film 1's and 2's issue. A production with such a low budget put together by newb filmmakers doesn't deserve anything less than a 5/10, even from the bottom-feeder haters. At least the professional critics got this one right. It's a great at least one-time watch, especially considering the slim-pickings we've had since the pandemic started. Thus it's a well deserved 8/10 from me."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11804152/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," Okay ","Well, like many reviewers stated, there would be a lot of ways to get rid of the husband's arm/hand, if needed. Anyway, Till Death reminds me of Gerald's Game, a story written by the almighty Mr. King. Whereas the reading of the for mentioned book was a suspenseful pleasure, Till Death was rather an okayish experience. The second part (after our heroin got rid of her husband's body) I liked a little more. Anyway, the body of Megan Fox is still in pretty good shape, so my recommendation: read the book if you want suspense, watch the movie if you wanna watch Megan Fox."

Will Emma(Fox) be able to find a way out of all of this and set herself free from her bad husband Mark(Eoin Mulvan).There is alot of twists and turns in this film especially with Emma's deceased husband (who I forgot to mention shot himself while handcuffed to his wife)hiring hitmen to kill Emma over a crime involving Emma and a guy who assaulted her.Megan Fox is a great actress yet she gets alot of hate. Here in Till Death she showcased what she can do."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11804152/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Good premise but a very formulaic run out ","As I was watching 'Till Death' I kept thinking how I wished this wasn't an American film. With an American film you pretty much know what you're going to get going forward. There's a very specific formula they have to use otherwise their audiences simply don't accept it. It's one of the reasons the majority of films are so bland and forgettable these days. The sad thing is that 'Till Death' has a great concept and if the Europeans or the Koreans for examples had come up with the idea they could have done something special with it.Even considering how formulaic this film is, it is still a decent watch. Megan Fox does her best in the lead role. Her face doesn't move these days unfortunately, but we can still tell which emotion she is trying to portray most of the time. The pacing of the film is also very good. It moves at a good click and always has enough going on to keep us glued to the screen.I was just very disappointed with how the movie wrapped up. I won't spoil it at all, but it was just a very predictable and disappointing conclusion. I had a particular way in my head that I was hoping it would play out, and had it done so I would've been highly recommending this one. As it is I'll just say watch it with low expectations and you'll likely have a decent time."

He makes it all romantic for her and it looks like they will reconcile.Next morning she wakes up handcuffed...to him. He has one last surprise for her. Then he blows his brains out. Now she's attached to his corpse and has to drag him around the house and elsewhere. There are no tools or useful objects anywhere in the house/garage/boathouse. The car has been emptied of gasoline and she has no phone.Then her lover shows up and freaks out. Then suddenly two guys show up to repair something but act all weird. When the lover won't let them in, one of the guys kills him. Megan hides. That guy is of course the guy who attacked her years ago. We learn there is a safe in the house and these guys want diamonds that are in there. They need the combination and the husbands finger. What follows next is a cat and mouse game of Megan having to hide/escape/go on the offensive from these guys while dragging the husbands corpse around.Till Death is pretty unique, interesting, occasionally tense and funny as well. It is a well-made horror thriller centered around this odd scenario and the mystery of why the husband did what he did. The role is well-suited for Fox. Her character is pretty tense herself and uncomfortable and doesn't open up a whole lot. She has to use facial expressions more than words. Overall, I enjoyed this quirky movie quite a bit."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11804152/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," An okayish thriller that somewhat achieves its only task of reviving Megan Fox's career! [+52%] ","Till Death doesn't come close to achieving the psychological payoffs of a Gerald's Game but what it holds good on is offering Megan Fox (once stereotyped in generic "hot girl" roles) something worthwhile. The horror here is only in the form of blood-spill, so let's get that out of the way. The entirety of the first act feels like an exercise in blandness - every actor including Fox simply goes through the motions without making us feel strongly for their respective characters. We have the by-now-clichd terrible husband (Eoin Macken), the wife (Fox) and her boyfriend (Aml Ameen), and finally, an ex-convict (Callan Mulvey) with a grudge. It only gets interesting around the 25-minute mark, however, even the second act is just Fox bumping around the house and its surrounding icy landscape with a corpse handcuffed to her.The third act thankfully features a few well-packaged, sufficiently gory thrills. When Fox gets into action-hero mode, she elevates the film to a fair extent. On the flip side, the climax plays out exactly the way you expect it to. It isn't a difficult film to sit through at all - to its advantage, the better parts arrive towards its grisly finale. Jason Carvey's writing is both clever and lacklustre at the same time: the deceptive cat-and-mouse bits intrigue while the overall predictability cannot be ignored. If nothing else, this is a perfectly serviceable comeback vehicle for Fox."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11809034/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Rurouni Kenshin: The Final started off quite alright, its final act and ending was both memorable and remarkable - containing one of the franchise's best fight sequences ","Keishi Otomo returns to the Rurouni Kenshin franchise with a direct sequel to the Kyoto duology called Rurouni Kenshin: The Final, this film was filmed back-to-back with The Beginning which takes place before the events of the first film. With it being a franchise with many characters of likeable and most being well written, there are a lot of characters returning, heroes and villains. Some are Kaoru, Sanosuke, Saito, Aoshi and Misao.Rurouni Kenshin: The Final adapts the Jinchu Arc which marks the first appearance of Yukishiro Enishi and Yukishiro Tomoe. Enishi witnessed the (accidental) killing of his older sister, by her then-husband, Himura Kenshin. Filled with grief and anger, he swore to bring jinchu "judgment from man" to the man who killed his only sister. Ten years later, Yukishiro Enishi have formed The Six Comrades, a group of six men (himself included), to assist him in his revenge against Kenshin, also being the boss of the Shanghai Mafia. We quicky learn that he was the person who supplied Makimachi Misao in the Kyoto arc, so Enishi have been pulling some of the strings.I'll be totally honest here, I didn't really like the first arc, I found it okey at most. The second act was an improvement but the editing and some of the writing wasn't the best, also The Six Comrades came off rather silly and not menacing enough. But I appreciated the costumes and how accurate it was to the anime and manga. There were no emotion or stakes in the fight sequences, but that changed in the third act. Oh yes indeed. The third and final act was truly amazing, with Himura Kenshin going up against Yukishiro Enishi, the fight between them are some of the finest fight sequences in the franchise (up to this point) and there's true emotion as the history behind them is well written and it's easy to sympathize with both of them, it's also an unpredictable action sequence that kept me on the edge of my seat.The musical score wasn't as epic in scale as Kyoto Inferno and The Legend Ends, but Naoki Sato created a great score that kept it suspense and dramatic. It helped a lot with the fight sequences. The fight choreography was stunning, like always. Takeru Satoh's performance as Himura Kenshin continues to be a clear highlight in the franchise, the dramatic work and the stunt work, great actor. The director and cinematographer shot the movie for more than 7 months and was carried out at 43 locations nationwide, including Kyoto, Hiroshima and Osaka. There's some truly beautiful locations and the sets they built and used, remarkable. The cinematography and direction were top notch.Rurouni Kenshin: The Final had a great ending which tied up things nicely, and this was supposed to be the last movie. But I just feel like Keishi Otomo nor the cast is done with the franchise, it feels like there are endless of opportunities, another film with Kenshin or a spin-off with Saito Hajime. Non the less, we got another great samurai film that's stylish and entertaining."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11809034/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Oops just realized I didn't watch the first three movies ","A live action adaptation of the anime with the same name. In 1879, Kenshin and his allies face their strongest enemy yet: his former brother-in-law Enishi Yukishiro and his minions, who have vowed to take their revenge.I have never heard of this anime, so I only judge the two movies as standalone.The best part of the movie was for sure the action. The choreography was amazing with people flying around and got kicked through many rooms. The sword fight and movement from the main characters were incredibly clean and smooth.Another positive aspect was the villain, Enishi. Although the protagonist Kenshin was badass during action scenes, Enishi was badass throughout with the cool look and great acting. His motive made sense and he wasn't just a purely evil character.My biggest problem was the story itself. Even though the movie was 2 hours and 20 minutes, it felt very fast with many side characters introduced. However, there seemed to be too many side plots to be included in the whole movie. Also, because of this, there wasn't enough time to care for the characters. At the end, the emotion just wasn't there.Overall, solid actions but overdone story. 7.5/10."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11809034/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," What It Means To Be A Hero ","I'm not entirely sure why Kenshin resonates so strongly with me. He's an inspiring character who tries his best to atone for his past. A past frought with the slaughtering of an untold number of people. And yet, he strives to be a better man.A number of people have defined "nobility" as being better today than you were yesterday. And Kenshin seems to embody that.We're finally treated to the mastermind. The one person who's basically been behind everything Kenshin has had to deal with from the previous trilogy. We thought Shishio was bad, and he may still arguably be the worst, but enter Enishi, the man who financially backed Shishio, his warship, and everything else.To fully understand Enishi and his vile hatred toward Kenshin, you'll need to have seen "The Beginning." In fact, I would recommend seeing that film before this one.Kenshin, once again, is trying his best to live a quiet, peaceful life. But now, everyone he loves and cares about is under attack by Enishi, who will stop at nothing to maximize Kenshin's suffering.The beauty of the film comes in the last hour or so when many Kenshin's allies and former enemies alike, help him to run the gauntlet of hundreds of Enishi and Heixing's men. Heixing being Enishi's own connection with the Shanghai underworld.What we see is a transformation of character in former villains who now see the wisdom of Kenshin and his lifestyle. It proves that as soon as one man vows to change, it creates a ripple effect for others to do the same.Kenshin also finally reveals his past to his friends, how he got his scar, and why he vowed to change his ways. Tomoe saw the goodness in Kenshin even before Kenshin or Kaoru did. It usually only takes one person to have faith to start the ball rolling!Once again, we have epic action sequences that, somehow, is even moreso than the previous trilogy. But also, the action lies at the periphery of a much deeper film that is full of heart, wisdom, and inspirational characters. And mostly, it shows us a glimmer of a path of what a true hero looks like. And what it truly means to be noble."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11809034/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Decent remake ","This series is actually a remarkable adaptation of the manga and animation. Similar to its previous movies, the scenes and battles are shot beautifully, with fast and well choreographed sword actions, and a decent plot that retains some essence of the original. While Kenshin was based on a most feared assassin in Japanese history, this part of the side story(OVA anime) isnt from the original author but the production company.There are also some other downsides like overloading with too much long battles with the pawns and subordinates which becomes a bit of drag, over exaggerated acting by some actors and ridiculous costumes/moves which were some of the common problems of Japanese movies, well as some rather long stalling with motionless instances. Though I cant blame the production too much as this is still adapted from an anime and it had tried to keep these at minimal, I would prefer the story to stick more closely to the anime, while the presentation matches more closely to the real world to make the movie more convincing, with characters castings that have closer resemblance to the anime/manga."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11809034/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," A satisfying conclusion for the franchise ","Rurouni Kenshin: The Final is the 4th entry in the franchise, but not the final entry despite its name. I was genuinely surprised when they announced they would be making 2 more in the franchise and it would be the final ones. I was very stoked about it as I love the franchise as they are one of the few live-action manga movies that deliver. The premise is "In 1879, Kenshin and his allies face their strongest enemy yet: his former brother-in-law Enishi Yukishiro and his minions, who have vowed to take their revenge". So does Rurouni Kenshin: The Final stick the landing or should it have just remained a trilogy?Firstly, Rurouni Kenshin: The Final continues to deliver on the authentic and beautiful set design with sumptuous costuming. Naoki Sato also returns to score the movie with him bringing a more sombre theme for both Kenshin and the main antagonist that is very effective. The cinematography by Takuro Ishizaka is visually stunning at times with some shots that perfectly capture the emotions of the scene. The amazing choreographed action set pieces return here with the glorious wirework and it is still awesome to watch. Despite it being 6 years since the previous entry, the actors are still great in their role including the new cast members, although Yahiko was recast because the previous actor is no longer a kid. Everything I loved from the previous entries in the franchise is still here and I am glad about that.This entry does do something different with the story and that is by making it more personal for Himura Kenshin. We can see this by the antagonist, Enishi Yukishiro, being his brother in law who wants revenge. Enishi is a fantastic villain and while he doesn't top the previous villain Makoto Shishio in the cool and fearsome factor, he is a lot more interesting. He is not some over the top cartoony bad guy who wants power, glory or chaos but wants Kenshin to pay for his sins. Enishi does terrible things in the movie but he is still very sympathetic as his motives are understandable and we see how damaged mentally Enishi is. Due to Enishi vengeance, we also see Kenshin at his lowest point as he realizes that this is all because of him. We see him truly questioning himself on whether he deserves his happiness and how he should atone. It's a great conclusive story for Kenshin that perfectly wraps his arc and leads to a satisfying end for the franchise.Unfortunately, since it is primarily focused on Kenshin and Enishi, the supporting characters don't get much characterization. Kaoru remains as a damsel in distress but with a weaker romance story than Kenshin has with Tomoe in the next entry. Sano who has always been a punching bag but gets an awesome fight by the end is just a punching bag in this entry with no awesome fight. Yahiko talks about being stronger and braver but never does anything. Megumi is just kind of there. There are also some other returning supporting characters but they are mostly there to show that Kenshin has friends worth fighting for and to have some cool fights.There are also some pacing issues I had with this film as during the second act the pacing drops significantly. The second act contains no action scenes and is mostly dedicated to characters being sad or exposition and flashbacks. I do understand the importance of the exposition and flashbacks but it drags for too long. On that note, there are way too many flashbacks with a fair amount being unnecessary such as flashbacks to things that occurred minutes ago or events that happened in this movie that people watching didn't forget. There is also a flashback that lasted over 5 minutes that spoiled the entire prequel, Rurouni Kenshin: The Beginning, which came out after this film. Additionally, I don't get why this is not the final entry as it feels like watching Rurouni Kenshin: The Beginning, the actual final entry, first will make it easier to appreciate this film and could have allowed the director to avoid the overuse of exposition and flashbacks.Overall, Rurouni Kenshin: The Final is a great send-off for the titular character. It wraps up the story satisfyingly with a more emotional story while still giving us the terrific fight scenes we all know and love. It does have some pacing issues and certain scenes can feel like it goes on for a little too long. However, I still loved it despite the flaws and was very happy that it stuck the landing. Just make sure to watch Rurouni Kenshin: The Beginning before this though and have Rurouni Kenshin: The Final as the last film you watch in the franchise; it is just more satisfying that way."

","One of the best movie of one of the best live action adaptation series of an anime franchise, I like the background story it builds up to, the practical effect is good, the fight choreography of each fight is, by god, over the top, probably the highest selling point of the movie series, a perfect blend of samurai swordsmanship and body flicking technique of kung fu, the filmmakers really know how to bring up the fight scenes from the anime to life, something that even Hollywood will never be able to mimic. One minus point that bothers me is how they make Sanosuke, one of the strongest fighter and one of the fans' most favorite and interesting main character in the franchise, useless. His sole purpose in this movie is almost only to act as some sort of a comic relief for every time the plot takes a dark turn. But overall, it's a pretty enjoyable watch. It's there with the live action Bleach adaptation."

But the peace is shattered by the emergence of a new adversary from Kenshin's past with a link to the Chinese Mafia, and could trigger an upheaval in the new government of Tokyo. Kenshin must once again draw on his back-blade to defeat this new threat together with Sanosuke the street fighter, Aoshi the long bladed watcher, and the chain smoking police inspector Saito . Cue excitement galore amid moments of high emotion and drama. Although not hitting the heights of the previous installments (parts 2 & 3) there is enough swashbuckling action and heartwarming moments to please both fans of the series as well as new converts. The baby faced assassin Sojiro also appears in one of the series' show stopping action highlights. Great continuation of the adventures of the man formerly known as the fearsome killer Battosai, who has learnt that to atone for his past sins, he should not die, but to preserve his own life to perform good deeds. Pic ends with poignant moments, perhaps a closure to Kenshin's relationship with his long time admirer, Kaoru. Highly recommended, and much better than any Hollywood action movie recently."

You might as well watch the avengers or the PJ Hobbit. It does not follow the story and there are extended made up fights all the way through. Japanese Culture is missing and replaced with Western shallowness. As an example Kenshin here in late 1800s holds hand with Kaoru Kamiya, to keep up with culture they would be walking two meters apart rather than hold hands. Very disappointed.

Every single moment of the film is better than the last, I loved seeing all the characters again, and while Kenshin was as always an amazing protagonist, the highlight was definitely Yukishiro Enishi, the best villain of the series. The dynamic between hero and antagonist is incredible, and unlike anything the series has achieved before, and I loved every moment of it, even though I initially hated Enishi, even though his character arc was amazing, but I can't stand the things he's done, I genuinely hated him that much as I watched the film, and it worked.

It helps if you like lots and lots of androgynous glowering through implausible wigs. You know that the 20-something guy with the purple-grey, half-baked jheri-curl/frosted tips wig is bad because you're supposed to hate him for hating his natural hair so much.Did you know that you can swing a sword into a crowd and by virtue of being the good guy with the best, longest wig, your blade discharges an invisible current that passed through the target individual and kills everyone else with a sword behind him? They all topple like bowling pins, and there's a hundred more on the way! Good guy wigs will also allow you to dodge bullets when you're ambushed and cornered by over 20 henchmen, each firing one, sometimes two guns simultaneously until everyone's out of ammo at the instant you stop running! Sometimes, 1-on-1 combat is punctuated by blood spraying, but if you collect enough melodrama points and Xanax, you can unleash multiple bowling pin charged attacks for easier cleanup. Watch out for the guy in the gimp mask swinging his metal claws around; he'll use his robot growl at you and show you his yellow contact lenses when he takes his mask off. When you're not speaking, just think of Nick Rhodes from Duran Duran and you'll get through anything.Honest opinion: 2/10 on the merit of period set design."

A Perfect Diwali Bonanza For Family Audience! ","Hum Do Hamare Do (2021) : Movie Review -Family dramas are very common in Bollywood but you can't deny the fact that this is one of the most loved genre in India. It isn't just about entertainment but that emotional connect too. Those days are gone when bollywood used to make films like Hum Apke Hai Kaun and Hum Saath Saath Hai, and this new generation filmmakers and audience, both wanted a change. Abhishek Jain's Diwali offering 'Hum Do Hamare Do' may not be a direct answer to those popular 90s flicks but it's certainly a nice attempt on its level. This new-age family dramas people always talk about will get better sooner or later, but let's not miss some real fun now. Hum Do Hamare Do has everything you expect from a Mainstream Family Entertainer but moreover it's that one film which actually tries to convince you about family values without using blood-relations.The film is about young lovebirds Dhruv (Rajkummar Rao) and Anya (Kriti Sanon) who decides to get married. The problem is, Dhruv is an orphan and Anya wants to marry a man who has a perfect family of her dreams. A hilarious ride begins when Dhruv brings fake parents who happened to be lovebirds in their younger days. Two parallel love stories of two different generations are configured to provide you hilarious gags. Prashant Jha's screenplay makes it easy for you to understand things but you do smell what's coming later. That family melodrama is avoided to keep the humour alive and that's the best thing about Hum Do Hamare Do's screenplay.This film becomes different from other family dramas because it has young brigade teamed up with experienced actors like Paresh Rawal and Ratna Pathak Shah. Whatever Paresh Rawal couldn't do in Priyadarshan's 'Hungama 2', he does it here and how. That old Paresh Rawal we adored in films like Hera Pheri, Hungama, Bhagam Bhaag is back with the bang. Purushottam Mishra is by far his most humourous character recently. Supporting him, Ratna Pathak Shah is just brilliant. Her expressions and dialogue delivery looks so real and it doesn't beocme spoofy at all. Kriti Sanon and Rajkummar Rao makes a lovely chemistry. The major comedy scenes have gone into Paresh Rawal's kitty but the supporting cast is equally responsible to make them look hysterical.Abhishek Jain and Deepak Venkateshan's writing is good but not flawless. You can easily notice some blunders here and there but as we know family dramas are meant to have few loopes so that you can create a filmy experience. The best thing done by Director Abishek Jain is that he didn't leave it lose anywhere except for the songs. He couldn't battle out that stereotype notion of bollywood family dramas that you have to have two songs before interval and two after that. The film loses some grip there but those two family songs are surely engaging. A glamorous number which appears with end credits is tappy enough. The film may look slow at the beginning but that's because he has something fantastic to show later. It keeps you busy for two hours so there'll be no moments to have a little nap. Overall, Hum Do Hamare Do is funny, dramatic and emotionally well balanced. There's something in this film which makes it a recommendable product that two generations in the family should watch together.RATING - 6/10*"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11816092/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," The Intent was there, but the execution failed to deliver. ","What is family? Is it only about sharing an identical surname? Or to live under the same roof? Or is it something that goes way beyond the definition of our conservative norms? Does it have any impediments? Any premeditated barriers set by society? And what would it all amount to if somebody decides to take a different route all of a sudden?Abhishek Jain's 'Hum Do Hamare Do' attempts to pose a stern challenge against the very foundation of a well functioning Family. The notion itself begs a lot of valid queries and without a doubt has a significant value tied to it.Even though not all parts of the audience would come in agreement with such fairly questionable viewpoints and it could also come off as naive and childish at times but I'm pretty sure that nobody would deny that it's an honest attempt at executing things in a slightly different manner.Do you know what the actual problem is though? That there's not been proactive support from the Writing. Not to mention, due to the same reason, it falls short of bringing us to a tangible verdict. Dialogues barely comply with the broad spectrum of emotions and feelings this film hoped to achieve.Performance-wise, no one outshines heavily as an individual; it rather comes across as a collective effort from the whole ensemble who did just enough to help us navigate through the entire duration.In short, 'Hum Do Hamare Do' is serviceable only as a pastime and has just enough entertainment quotient to somewhat appease the mainstream audience. However, there's not much in it for the intellectuals though!"

He falls in love with Kriti Sanon's character who is seemingly obsessed with family and relationships.How he endeavors to win over her and her family with a 'fake' set of parents forms the rest of the story.

",""Hum Do Hamare Do" generally refers to a couple and their two kids, who help complete a family. However, in the movie Hum Do Hamare Do, the hero is in dire need of parents to have a happily ever after. Dhruv (Rajkummar Rao) is a self-made man. An entrepreneur, he has created his own app and deals in Virtual Reality technology. During the launch party of his app he meets a blogger, Anya Mishra (Kriti Sanon). The meeting goes south pretty fast, but subsequently we know that Cupid has struck.Story by Abhishek Jain & Deepak Venkateshan, Hum Do Hamare Do is a comedy of errors that is inspired by multiple Bollywood movies we have seen over years. Boy and girl meet in a chance encounter, boy falls in love at first sight and decides he will only marry her or Sanyas! She demands, it is fulfilled, twist and climax. Screenplay by Prashant Jha.Paresh Rawal and Ratna Pathak Shah are the real heroes in this movie. The actors make you feel how much more substantial work they deserve than the industry is offering them. As a fake father, Rawal leaves no stone unturned to become one. His one-liners and the timing are so balanced that it all looks improvised and not choreographed. In a blink-and-miss scene when Kriti comes to his home, he tells her 'beta jhuk ke ana', while it could have been easily offensive by some other actor, Rawal makes it sarcastically funny.Ratna Pathak Shah is as good as she gets. Having loved her as a mother in Kapoor & Sons, this is a new shade. The actor knows when to act without words and when to be funny. Well, she also cries and it is an adorable moment. Her chemistry with Rajkummar as her son is surprisingly good and soothing to watch.Rajkummar Rao, who has fast become an actor to reckon with, delivers yet another earnest performance and proves why he's beyond the box office. Kriti Sanon is effective and does justice to her part as Anya.Despite being a good actor, Aparshakti Khurana seems to being forecfully stereotyped as the hero's best friend. Manu Rishi Chadha and Prachi Shah Pandya lend good support.Nonetheless, the film has some really nice and funny moments. At the same time, it also makes a telling comment on families portraying a happy and united image outside while squabbling and fighting within. And that one can choose a perfect family if need be. 'Hum Do Hamare Do' is a perfect watch for Diwali."

It's a great family watch. We all enjoyed it!!"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11816092/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","1"," Great actors doing terrible film. ","They wasted great actors for this film. This film is not even mediocre is just terrible the only redeeming quality is music by Sachin-Jigar.Parvesh Rawal and Ratna patak give best performance from this film."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11816092/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Orphan hires parents to have a family marriage ","Two aspects of the movie are I found interesting.1. It is about an orphan Rajkummar Rao hiring out fake parents so that they can talk to the parents of his lady love Kriti Sanon about their marriage. A comparatively new idea for a film. ( However It would have been socially relevant if he had selected an old couple from an old age home instead of hiring them through a shady character) 2. A connected question to this issue is also discussed in the movie though superficially. How do you define family ? Is it just a group of people with the same surname even though they may be at daggers drawn ? Can't others who live and love together but have different surnames be called family? Point to ponder.Be that as it may, the movie itself is nothing much to write home about. A romcom which finds it difficult to raise laughs through dialogue or situations and it just about manages to entertain. Rajkummar, an orphan spends his childhood washing vessels in a roadside Dhaba (owned by Paresh Rawal) and later grows up to be a successful businessman. Kriti on the other hand is also an orphan been brought up by an uncle. She develops a soft corner for Rajkummar since he teaches street kids. She is looking forward to affectionate in laws with a pet doggie.A question one can ask the director. Why didn't Rajkummar just tell Kriti that he is an orphan and wants to marry her ? Where was the desperate need to get fake parents ? Both Paresh Rawal and Ratna Pathak are good as the fake parents. An interesting comic subplot shows a guy providing on rent a complete bridegroom party complete with a sexy sister in law, a sulking uncle, a bad tempered aunt etc etc."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11816092/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","1"," Terrible, immature and boring ","A boy refuses to tell the girl that he is an orphan and gets fake parents to cover up. And justifies it arrogantly and after being rejected, still gets her. This is the typical Indian male chauvinist type movie. Forced comedy, pathetic script. Just ignore this."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11816092/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," Boring ","In spite of attempting to play the family card, that too with a cast of legends (not Sanon), it's average, boring, a drag...could have been presented better."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11816092/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","2"," Absolutely nothing new!! ","Incredible cast with a disastrous plot. Let's face it, if characters in bollywood movies don't take terrible decisions and don't keep things hidden from everyone around them, these movies would get nowhere. After all, what bad can come from introducing your would-be spouse to just some fake parents? To top it all, he gets mad at the girl and justifies it all in an idiotic monologue in the end. Chauvinist much?It was also very weird that in the age of feminism when we are preaching that only husband and wife CAN BE and IS a family and you don't need kids to complete it, the movie says otherwise.Comedy scenes seemed forced. Paresh Rawal seemed like a wasted talent. Music is passable.One star extra for Ratna Pathak only."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11816092/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," great romcom ","This movie was a great, heartwarming, family friendly movie. I absolutely enjoyed it throughout. It's light-hearted, funny, and cute. The story is quite unique, and although the script could've been better, it was still a fun watch."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11816092/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," Absolute delight, watch with family! ","Loved the movie, very cute, very naive, not a 10/10 but pretty close. Paresh Raval and Ratna Pathak did what they do best - amazing acting. They are living legends. Apar was usual, again best friend of the hero but he can't pull off a sikh from chandigarh, a dilli ka shohda kind of dost ka role should have suited better on him here. Kriti was an eye candy, loved some of her recent performances in other movies too, since Dilwale. She's definitely not just beauty, she's fabulous, takes any character and adapts to it like it's written for her. Movie could've been a bit shorter in my opinion, like office scenes had no relation to the movie's plot or story."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11816092/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Decent Family Entertainer ","#OneWordReview #HumDoHumareDo Decent .Good heartwarming movie. Performance of Paresh Rawal Ratna Pathak Shah was too good. Rajkumar rao & kriti Sanon done a decent job, Aparashakti Khurana was good too. Comedy was good. But I loved the Family part the way they present Family Values, the importance of family it adds so much emotions throughout the movie. Climax was Excellent. Definitely a must watch movie. #HumDoHumareDoReview 3.5/5*"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11816092/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," A complete family movie ","If you ignore the premise of the film, as to why did Rajkumar get fake parents (which is beyond absurd), it's an excellent movie. Every single actor, has outdone themselves. Watch this with your family. Everyone will love it. Finally, even after watching this, if you don't agree that Kriti Sanon is the best female actor in Bollywood right now, you've got to be biased"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11816092/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","3"," Ok ... ","Ok movie.Actually rated 5 but Thanks to Hotstar for putting 8/10 adds at every 10 mins interval ... I think they believed adds in between will help build the story .. of whatever was there .."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11816092/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," A Feel Good Family Entertainer Movie ",""Hum Do Humhare Do" starring Rajkumar Rao, Kirti Sannon, Paresh Rawal, Ratna Pathak Shah in lead roles..... Aparshakti Khurana, Manu Rashi & Prachi Shah plays the supporting roles...Released on Disney Hotstar on 29th October 2021Verdict : Super Hit...When we heard the movie name we felt it will be based on family planning, but from trailer it was very clear that a boy ( Rajkumar Rao) makes a family of himself by hiring a fake mom dad played by Paresh Rawal and Ratna Pathak Shah to marry his love Kirti Sannon....Performance wise, Paresh Rawal is Paresh Rawal.... His comic timing and dialogue delivery never fails to impress the audience.....Ratna Pathak Shah when joined hands it was a double dhamaka..... ... Rajkumar Rao, Kirti Sannon and others were a part of the ingredients as these two artists have taken up the movie in their hands....Now let's come to the content.... What i felt or if what questions i came across after watching is when a person be successful in life?? Is he has the materialistic things, Nooooooooo....the answer is " A FAMILY".....Its not required family should be of same blood, its just that purest feeling which makes two or more people connect each other & that is "LOVE".....A family is the foundation for a person to move ahead in their life, a shoulder to lay down, a pillow to cover up the tears, a window to enter harmful elements, a person's life is incomplete without a family......A feel good movie which can be definitely watched with family...It has laughter & it has emotions too...."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11816092/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," For true filmy ","This movie is showing importance of family, bonding with family & people can't live with family, overall this was a good movie if you love your family you can feel the movie"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11816092/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Interesting concept but too predictable! ","First of all Ratna Pathak and Paresh Rawal are phenomenal in this film! They literally stole the whole show for me.Kriti Sanon does a great job too, and as an actor she has improved a lot.Although I was expecting a lot from Rajkummar Rao as he is phenomenal usually but felt a little flat in this film!Overall the story is new and unusual and quirky but towards the end gets too predictable and the climax stands weak!But it's a one time watch for sure and will entertain you!"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11816092/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," Finally a complete family entertainer! ","Bollywood had forgotten the meaning of family after the Sooraj Barjatya era. But here comes a film that shows the importance of family from the perspective of someone who never had one. To top it all, it is a laughter-filled ride. This one deserves a 10!"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11816092/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," Lovely movie ","It's a lovely movie, not outstanding but definitely worth watching. You can watch it with your family unlike today's vulgar movies. Definetly recommend................"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11816092/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Decent Family Entertainer Paresh Rawal&Ratna Pathak Shah Rock It ","Was a great entertaining film with good performances, really dnt understand y it's getting negative reviews. I really enjoyed the film as it was entertaining and also had all the elements such as a bit of comedy a bit of romance n also emotion's,so I enjoyed the film. I rate it a 7.5/10 stars. A good family entertainer with no any vulgarity."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11818426/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Good description of mental instability ","It is difficult to perform a character like Gritt, her helplessness in the face of lack of empathy, her mental degradation... Brigitte Larsen does a magnificent work, with the advantage of knowing the character from the short film "Retract" (Itonje Simer Guttormsen, 2016). There is a narrative construction of self-destruction, or rather the inability to make the right decisions. And this process is well built in the changes of format or in the more unstable style of the images at the end."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11821582/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","1"," Looking for a Great Werewolf flick?!? This ain't it... ","Anytime I see I a new movie that's come out which reportedly states it's about lycanthropes I begin to get my hopes up. After all werewolves are probably my favorite thing to watch coming out of Hollywood. Like I said, "I begin" then reality sets in and reminds how 90% of the few werewolf movies made these day plain SUCK."As The Village Sleeps" is no exception. From the very beginning you can see how cheaply it was filmed. The characters (who couldn't act) are all dislikable except for possibly the older, married couple. The writing was inconsistent with plot holes all over the place. People just went missing without any explanation. The special effects and make-up were high school level. And the conclusion will leave you saying "Seriously?!?".Yeah this film is that bad and it's people like this that give this type of movie genre a bad reputation. Hopefully they'll move on to making zombie flicks. They can try to peddle their fare there in that flooded market."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11821582/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","1"," Such a worst ","Really every thing is at worst level..actings,plot cinematography etc.Boring movie."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11821582/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","2"," Painful to watch ","The only reason that I haven't rated this movie as a 1 is that the camera work and editing are reasonable enough.That is where any praise at all ends.The script is terrible and the acting is (on the most part) even worse. The plot is weak and any attempt to build tension fails dismally, partly but not completely, due to the ineffective score.I can't stress enough: this isn't one of those films that is "so bad it's good". It's just plain bad."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11821582/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","3"," Forget the acting, the other aspects of the movie work. ","We open on a car pulling over to the side of a desolate road - the woman inside goes to bury something in the dirt and set it alight. Only to be disturbed and runs back to the car, the guy who was driving is missing and we hear ominous growling as she is dragged out of the car by an unseen force.I went into this blindly and with that opening I assumed it was demons haha. I was wrong! What starts off as an indie film with questionable acting is actually a fun (bad but enjoyable once you find out what kind of bad) werewolf movie! Or is it?!The main group are staying at a cabin on a Native Reservation when they decide to play a card game (I think it was either called Lynched or Townsfolk) which marks players as werewolves, civillians, a witch and a cat. Cut to the next scene where they're all waking up, seemingly drugged and realising that the game is real and they're being hunted. Through hazy memories and splitting up, some start to turn on each other, others banding together to try and figure out the mystery of whom the werewolf is to survive by sunrise.I mentioned the questionable acting, and it is very questionable at that, however the werewolf makeup designs, film score and just plain wanting to find out who would end up being hunted next kept me watching.As The Village Sleeps is out now on Prime Video!"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11821582/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","1"," Terrible. Don't waste your time ","This is a BAD movie seriously!This is a BAD movie seriously!This is a BAD movie seriously!"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11821582/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","1"," Not worth to watch...! ","All actors are act horrible... No plot,no scare,no stories. Like students' project which is very low budget. Better you you watch Mr. Bean again and again..."
