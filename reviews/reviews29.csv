I guess he made this one to pay his food, electricity, gas and phone bills, in waiting for something better in the future. Directing is ok, but the story is so lousy, it looks like a grade Z, straight to DVD crap, as we saw by dozens since the eighties, starring Dolph Lungren or Steven Seagal. The 2.35 frame is surprising for such a crap. The actress who plays a lesbian - the only surprise here, not a clich - does her best to save the whole, but that's a fight lost in advance. There are so many holes in this story that the audiences may feel to be treated as idiots, nearly an insult to their intelligence. I don't even speak of the more than predictable ending that the coup de grace, the bullet in the head for this condemned to death feature. Forget it and wait for the next Julien Leclercq's project: the BRAQUEURS series."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11734264/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," A Gay Heroine Who Kills Butt!!! ","Ukrainian actress Olga Kurylenko plays a troubled French soldier in co-writer & director Julien Leclercq's austere revenge thriller "Sentinelle" who launches on a vendetta against the dastard who raped her younger sister and left her for dead. Pared down to 81 gritty minutes, this spartan saga efficiently dispenses with the preliminaries in short order before our heroine improvises 'an eye for an eye' Old Testament retribution. Moreover, our heroine isn't some hysterical half-wit. She survived an arduous tour of duty in war-torn Syria with the French 92nd Infantry Regiment where she served as their interpreter. She convinced her commanding officer not to shoot the wife of a suspected terrorist in the back of the head. Initially, the wife had refused to divulge her spouse's whereabouts over fear for her son's life. Klara promises no harm will befall her son. The soldiers act to protect the couple's young son. Surprise of surprises, the father gives himself up, but his son blows himself to smithereens at his father's bidding! Klara witnessed this ghastly event when a fellow soldier found explosive charges strapped to the juvenile Syrian's chest. This harrowing moment haunts Klara like shrapnel in her soul.The French Army transfers Klara back to France and reassigns her to serve in Opration Sentinelle. Actually, France commenced this real-life, domestic military campaign after repeated outbreaks of terrorism rocked the country in 2015. Well-armed, clad-in-camo, combat troops patrolled French streets and helped stray tourists find their motels. Klara suffers from migraines as a result of that traumatic moment. Warning her about the perils of addiction, Klara's army doctor prescribes a cocktail of opioids, beta-blockers, and sedatives, so she can manage her PTSD. Back home again, Klara complains about her lukewarm military career. Graduating at the top of her class, she speaks five languages fluently. She complains her superiors have passed over her and promoted others.Klara and her fellow soldiers continue to prowl the streets and beaches for potential terrorists. Every time she spots a backpack abandoned in a public place; Klara relives the memory of the youth obliterating himself. Part of Klara is happy to return home to be with her younger sister Tania (Marilyn Lima) and her widowed mother Maria (Antonia Malineva of "Marie-Line"). Tania persuades Klara to accompany her to the Club Millennium for a night of dancing and drinking. While Klara cavorts on the dance floor with another woman, Tania joins a group of rowdy Russian guys. Clearly, Klara prefers women to men, but Leclercq and co-writer Matthieu Serveau never explore this revelation. Later, the following day, Klara walks out on her one-night stand and then is shocked to find Tania in a coma at the local hospital. Looking at her sister's bruised and battered face, Klara decides to investigate. She learns the guy Tania left the club with wasn't the guilty party. Instead, his evil, amoral father is the culprit, but he has diplomatic immunity, so the police cannot touch him until Tania recovers. Naturally, Klara ignores these niceties as well as his diplomatic status and his goon squad of bodyguards.Director Julien Leclercq stages two slam-bang, knockdown, drag-out brawls with our heroine outnumbered in each fight. Eventually, Klara snaps and steals a pistol and two 5.56mm Fama assault rifles from the army barracks. Initially, she screws up when she tries to kill the slippery Russian, and his bodyguard nearly drowns her in a tub. You'll love how she thwarts the bodyguard! Nothing if not resilient, Klara never quits and pursues her quarry. "Sentinelle" is unlike most thrillers because our heroine doesn't bounce off walls as if they were trampolines. Instead, like her adversaries, she suffers the ill after-effects of combat but musters enough spirit to keep kicking. Sadly, Leclercq and Matthieu Serveau leave questions unanswered about Klara which would have been illuminating. Altogether, "Sentinelle" ranks as an above-average thriller about an indomitable dame who doesn't shirk her filial obligations. You'll need a Netflix subscription to stream this unforgiving manhunt."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11734264/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," Feels realistic, but it's not. And it fails storywise. ","I wanted to like the film and I expected to. It's a French film, and they usually don't pull their punches, then it's action and French action movies, when well done, are the best, and finally it starred Olga Kurylenko, who is a talented actress, not to mention really good looking. I mean, she's 40 and she looks 27.Yet the whole movie is following this trained soldier fighting random people in order to get to her target. The entire story of the film is that one sentence. And the fight scenes were good, but far between, and too often they started from a careful and silent exploration of a building and some guy suddenly coming out of nowhere. The rest was boring and didn't make much sense. I do hope in France they don't take PTSD soldiers with an opioid addiction, arm them with Famas and let them roam wherever they want, even when wanted by the police and when they know where she's headed. The characters: all formulaic and most were superfluous. When they were not, they had a lot of extra characteristics not used anywhere. For example Olga's character knows five foreign languages - I expected her to put that to use, but it was just a random fact.The worst, though, was the ending. In order to make it a bit longer, they had the bad guy escape once, only to be killed a few minutes later, when the target of one hour and twenty minutes was reached.Bottom line: a failed film that doesn't know what it wants to be."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11734264/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt"," Not fully following the expectations of the genre, it is too lean a take on revenge porn. ",""It's a war within yourself that never goes away." Buried Above GroundSentinelle is a Netflix actioner with so little fat you want to stuff it with croissants. Although I am consistently in favor or minimalism, this revenge porn entry also needs a heavy dose of Viagra. If you're looking for a French take on Taken, you can enjoy a few kick-ass moments and get out 80 minutes later none the worse off.Klara (Olga Kurylenko) suffers from PTSD (see quote above) after Operation Sentinelle as the opening amply sets up. Upon coming home to France, after a club visit with her sister, her sister is beaten and raped. The tragedy gives Klara the excuse to off some cookie-cutter thugs in pursuit of wealthy and protected very bad guys.Although it's pleasing to see Klara take down baddies twice her diminutive size, even those encounters are skin tight, giving too little satisfaction to those of us who like a bit of banter before the revenge. That sparse emotional take on Klara and the evildoers robs us of the vicarious, Promising-Young-Woman fulfillment that shows just how much the bad-boys deserve their punishment. The filmmakers' reluctance to take further Klara's lesbian orientation robs us again of a rich understanding of her complex character. The gratuitous sex scene after the club visit is not enough.According to the dictates of the revenge genre, this little whirlwind will get her man and thereby satisfy our need for closure to the crimes. Cinema has been attentive to the #me-too mandate (even in our daily lives vengeance has shaken the tree of a once noble politician like NY governor Cuomo), and now women are depicted as central symbols of a society that has had enough violation of the vulnerable. In other words, bring her on; don't hold back.Although Sentinelle promises to be a complement to the French tough ladies like Nikita, it reduces its scope by not attending fully to the genre, which is woke with the need for full emotional disclosure and full closure."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11734264/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," Mediocre ","Gently put, Sentinelle is a watered down version of movies like Taken (Liam Neeson) with a little more focus on the broken character of our heroin. The action sequences are okay but compared to the genre standard of vigilante, revenge movies rather mediocre and lack verve, violence, speed, amount. As the rest of the story does not really make up to that lack of action quality, Sentinelle can't really satisfy the audience action nor drama wise. All in all: okay, a movie of TV standard, with a solid game by Olga Kurylenko. Verdict: nothing remarkable, but not that bad like many reviews and ratings indicate, that's at least my opinion."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11734264/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","3"," A Poor Generic Film ","This film came onto Netflix last Friday and I saw it is literally 75 mins so I gave it a quick watch and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a damaged French Soldier on the hunt after her Sister ends up in a coma.Main Character I always think it is crazy that Olga Kurylenko was a Bond Girl, it just feels like she has disappeared over the years and that is a shame, but she plays the main character here and I think she did a decent job. She gives as strong a performance as she can with the material she is given, this is a pretty damaged person and character and Olga does a good job of showing that and especially, in the first act you saw it. But there is a limit on the character for sure, she doesn't get much development and there are elements of the character that aren't ever addressed and you wonder why this is the case.Supporting Characters This film doesn't have a particularly large cats and I am going to make this section nice and quick by saying none of them are particularly great. Olga's family don't do much, the police are bland and the bad guys are clich dull characters, so this is a big weakness of the film.Story Olga's character has an interesting story about her, you can tell she isn't your average soldier and that is made clear and the film does an alright job of that and it is cool seeing her go after these bad people. But the film lacks any depth towards it, and as I said the supporting characters are generic and it just feels like someone wrote this film incredibly quickly and it holds the overall product down.Script The script is also a weak part of the film, the drama isn't there and there is literally no humour. As I said it feels like this was a script that was written really quickly and not given much thought to it and that really shows when you think about it.Style The style of the film has some decent action scenes. It is cool to see Olga going after people and it is well filmed and pretty graphic at times for sure. I also appreciated that the film doesn't overstay its welcome and drag it out for much longer then it needed. But this film has some strange pacing, there are elements of the plot that don't need to be there and it slowed the film down and feels like it was only there because this film is already short enough.Overall Overall, this is a pretty poor film. It is one that was written and made incredibly quickly and it feels rushed and despite its short run time I feel like it isn't a film that needs to be seen."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11734264/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," I liked it ","Olga is a translator somewhere in the middle east. Her unit is looking for some guy. When a fellow soldier is about to use force to get the whereabouts of the guy, Olga intervenes and gets the info peacefully. They find the guy who is with his young son. A long scuffle ensues and he keeps repeatedly telling the son "to do it." And he does. The kid blows himself up and a bunch of soldiers.Back in France, Olga is now tasked with walking around popular spots and look for signs of trouble. She's traumatized and sees potential bombs and threats everywhere. He sister takes her out to dance one night. They get separated. The sister leaves with some rich Russian guys. Olga meets a hot girl and has hot sex. The sister doesn't make it home but has been raped and beaten. Olga goes off the books and starts investigating. It's not too hard to track down the rich Russians...who have diplomatic status. That gets her repeated warnings from her superiors. But Olga continues undeterred. There's a bit of a surprise about the real culprit and Olga will have to confront the guy repeatedly till she finds her revenge.I like Olga and she manages to carry this movie. It's a short movie with some grit and violence and is well filmed. Sure, the idea is generic but the setting and background make it a little different. Cinematography is nice and bright. Fortunately, the French haven't learned the bad Hollywood habit of of filming all crimes and all climaxes at night. The sex scene surprised me and was very hot. The action is well filmed and believable. There's really not much wrong with this movie and it's worth watching."

I gave this thriller not only for the rape story a chance but also where this action movie has been shot. The main locations were in Nice, South of France, along the Cte d'Azur in Cap d'Antibes and St. Jean Cap Ferrat. Enjoy these wonderful landscapes but don't expect too much from the film. Another talent of Olga is she talks good French and has the double nationality of Ukraine and France. With my wife I give a 6.5 /10"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11734264/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","3"," Pacing is the only good thing about this movie. ","Before watching Sentinelle, I knew it would be a very typical action movie about a woman seeking revenge, and had my expectations lowered. I just wanted a decent action flick to watch at night, and seeing Olga Kurylenko headline this title was another reason to go ahead with it. While I wasn't really bored since the film was economically paced (roughly 75 minutes without credits), what this film had to offer was not engaging or memorable in any way.And that is really sad since the film started out very well. First 15-20 minutes showed promise, but even the action scenes were so below par that I as an action fan was disappointed. The introduction is the only thing this film gets right; with our heroine constantly suffering from PTSD following a tragic incident, there was scope to expand on the suffering and hence make the proceedings fun, but no. Even the ending was meant to be cathartic, but it was bland, emotionless and went by without any impact.It's not completely terrible if you consider the duration and pacing; the tone is intense and hence it grabs attention from start to finish, which is what a film of this genre should do. However, what it holds our attention with isn't necessarily engaging. It quickly begins to lose the steam, many scenes feel shoddily written and it just feels disconnected as a whole. Sentinelle's got a few fight scenes, and while they're realistic, their impact worsens, especially as the film descends into a very unnecessarily twisted, boring, predictable climax that can be guessed by ANYONE.However, Olga is still pretty convincing and saves the film from a total disaster. Her performance is near-perfect, and the only reason I can say I found the film engaging. So if you are to watch this film, watch it only if you're her fan. It's a shame an action film with so much initial promise makes its action scenes feel bad and pointless, and the second half feels unintentionally funny when you realize how loosely written and connected it is. Within less than 30 minutes, I knew watching this was a huge mistake, and the rest of it just made me realize the joke's on me. I don't want to sound overtly negative, but I will be staying away from Netflix's originals for quite a time now and instead stick to watching older non-original titles just present on the site."

Its' very nice, has a really poetic silent melancholic narrative running through the entire story that adds to intrigue and lends to a compelling nuance which when culminates at the big denouement of the thing emphasizes the quiet intensity that is founded on the protagonist ongoing turmoil which she is dealing with , its as if no matter what, no matter where she turns she is dealing with some hardcore stuff, very very cool, and the action sequences are brilliant and the score doesn't overburden , it blends in like a stoic fog that stalks through the pages of a great novel , its very very cool to watch. I highly enjoyed it , Netflix picked a winner this time, I don't know if they watch the movies but this one comes highly recommended! Good job to everyone! it was way cool!"

A traumatized soldier went on a revenge quest against those that hurt her sister. What I liked about the movie was the lead actress, who sold the character well. Throughout the first half, we learned about the character's personal struggles and how she became more on edge. The actress portrayed this aspect well and made me understood the character. Then, she was also good on the action scenes, which had good choreography and decent camera work. This movie belongs to the revenge quest genre, and had some Taken and John Wick vibes. However, instead of trying something new, the plot was mostly cliches, which ruined the tension and thriller. Also, after the opening scene, the pacing slowed down a bit too much to drag out the length of the movie, which was not even that long. Certain plot points were weird and confused me. Overall, a very meh movie that repeated the common tropes of the genre. There's no need to watch this movie. 5/10"

In the final moment you stay from, is it serious? Nonsense to lengthen the film. Unnecessary sexual scenes. The advantage is that it lasts an hour and twenty and it still feels quite long.

Shes a really good B-movie actress that has been in some great action packed films. So when I read the premise and saw the trailer I thought thats what to expect. However by movie end, I was left dissapointed at what I thought could of been great movie.First of all the premise isn't the issue at all. It was actually pretty good. This is a movie about a woman who is in the military and witnesses a traumatic event and then is transferred home. Where she develops an addiction to drugs and in between her sister is assaulted/raped and she decides to exact revenge.The problem with this movie up until about the final 20 minutes its incredibly draggy. Its loaded with scenes that literally added zero value to the story. As well as scenes that felt incredibly repetitive. Its only 80 minutes minus the credits, but felt about 2 hours long.However what I will say is the visuals in this movie were excellent, as well I thought the acting was pretty good too. Look its not the worst movie I ever seen. I just think if director took different direction and was made by bigger budget company could've been a hit."

The primary villain for example is not fleshed out or developed even near enough to provide an emotional counterbalance for the protagonist. More screen time and better writing on him alone will improve it. We need to feel and fret about how bad he is.

It's not something I'll ever watch again, unless I have the chance to view only the fight scenes. They're raw and realistic, tense and pure adrenaline. The settings vary and so did the bad guys, or in one instance, bad girl. However, they are very few and far between. At 80min though, it's a fair trade. The acting is solid by Olga Kurylenko, who I've never really liked until lately. It seems age has done her justice, and plying these gritty action roles suits her well. The dramatic elements in this are intense at times and slow, dragged out otherwise. It's a bit of a dredge to get through, especially if you're expecting an action. This is a drama with action, not an action with drama. Wouldn't classify as a suspense or thriller either. Taking that under consideration, I'd recommend if you have the skip button ready; still, many of its non-action scenes have a lot of merit."

It's quite obvious. They're not commenting on the actual film, they're spouting right-wing, Fox News propaganda.Now, the film itself, which runs almost two hours (a running time that could maybe have been shaven down, as it's dialogue-heavy), is a pretty solid character story from a narrative standpoint. The group of protagonists each has their own individual burden to bear due to the pressures of conservative extremism within this "future" United States - a future that could very well occur if the United States doesn't course correct.The dialogue, especially the scenes in the barn, is quite poignant. Sometimes a little on-the-nose, but it works.Technically, it's shot and cut well with no real composition or audio problems. Not sure what the budget was on this flick, but I assume it was relatively low - and they made it work well with one main location.

It's also funny that many seem to think this was somehow written, produced, shot and edited after the capitol riots when in fact it was filmed 2+ years ago. The film is a bit slow moving but very tense, thoughtful and well performed, and not once are the words Democrat/republican or left/right mentioned. In fact, having watched the film, unlike these other reviews, it is clear thematically the filmmakers are telling a story about common humanity and acceptance. If other reviewers want to make the claim that attempting to find connection and bridge the gap that divides us is "left ideology" being shoved down their throats then I question what ideology they associate themselves with. This is a film with a lot on its mind and it clearly struck a nerve with some people - but maybe those people needed a good nerve striking?

With the weapons people have outside of militias now their ranks would only swell. Mass defections from the military, which we are beginning to see in real life, would add to the militias strength.

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11737466/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," A Polarizing Film for a Polarized Country ","Caught this new release On-Demand. The picture is set in the near future when radical forces, much akin to the far-right "Proud Boys", are barcoding anyone who doesn't fit their Hitleresque vision of society-- a list that includes gays, muslims and so-called liberal elites. A group of these hunted outcasts gather in a rural safe-house, awaiting the opportunity to cross the border into Canada where, presumably, they will be met and accepted by a kindler, gentler people-- not unlike the trip north that many American draft resisters took during the Vietnam War.The point many reviewers here on IMDB seem to miss is that "American Insurrection" is more than a film about liberal vs. Conservative, it's one that speaks to the growing intolerance that is crippling our country. The filmmaker's intention, I believe, was to provoke some kind of social dialogue at a time when both sides of the political spectrum are having a hard time hearing each other. I give "American Insurrection" 7 stars for the acting-directing-writing, and 9 for the balls it took to make it.Trust me, this is not a one or two star picture. If the majority of scores and reviews here on IMDB are any indication, I'm guessing the film has become a target for folks chatting each other up on conservative social media who haven't bothered to look beyond the trailer. After all, if they find the premise of "American Insurrection" so repulsive, why are they spending eight bucks to watch it?"

The acting and production values are superb, and the story is riveting. Most importantly, I love this movie humanizes "the other." Here, extreme "right-wingers" are not necessarily brainless reactionaries, and the theoretically open and compassionate "liberal-progressives" are fully capable of wicked violence. The truths in this movie, and the questions it asks, are not easy ones, but they remind us all to reject the stereotypes and biases we all carry, consciously or unconsciously. I think you have to be a bit brave to watch and consider this suspenseful tale, but doing so will leave you asking the right tough questions about your own biases and what we all need to do to find common ground and connect with people who are not like us."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11737466/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Not What I Expected ","I had heard this movie described as some anti-White leftist fantasy but it really wasn't. It's still propaganda to some extent (i.e. The overall premise being a paranoid fear of the real-world progressive left) but if you can suspend your disbelief and accept it for what it is it's not a badly done movie. Spoilers below, so stop reading now if you intend to watch it.As someone who identified with the character Gabe I would say that my biggest complaint was the lack of depth given to his early dialogue, particularly concerning where his anger stemmed from. Given that most people only get to hear that point of view taken out of context and/or intentionally misrepresented it would've really done the movie well to have gone deeper into the reasoning of the type of person Gabe is meant to characterize. The reason this is important and not just one person's nitpicking is because he belonged to a group of people who were not like him at all, and despite this eventually being revealed and addressed it is precisely those type of people who are often conflated with everyone who holds Gabe's views in real life. Since they didn't really give much context to his ideology, the audience (if they don't follow these issues that closely) will come away from the movie thinking that Gabe was simply misguided or "lonely" as he admits, rather than having real concerns about things like forced demographic changes and being villified for questioning them.I realize it's just a movie but in this day and age where everything is hyper political and people can't be honest when representing the other side, I feel it's important to get these things right - especially if the intended purpose of movies like these is to get people thinking about how we're not that different and should find a way to get along. Anyway, to summarize I think it was a fairly decent movie. A little over the top with the stereotypes and virtue signalling but it was still entertaining considering I originally expected to hate watch it."

The acting is top notch with each actor holding my attention telling each character's complex story. It all happens in the backdrop of extreme revolt but the film doesn't beat you over the head with politics....and it smartly goes down the road of "let's try to understand both sides of the issues"...or, at the very least, "let's listen to each other". Bravo to the writer for tackling a tough topic that has to be explored. American Insurrection may develop into a classic premonition of where we may be headed if we don't become more tolerant."

I want to like it because as a standalone film it was good, but because it is so obviously a left-wing circle jerk of nonsense I can't bring myself to rate it positively. I even watched their YouTube watch party thing and sure enough they believe in all the usual wacky things that the modern left does. It's not subtle at all and the entire thing just oozes insincerity. If they really wanted to make it a message about finding common ground they should have first ventured outside their own echo chamber (yes, both sides have one!) and learned what the people they're depicting really think. The prisoner in this film just seemed like a caricature to bounce lefty talking points off of with none of the opposing arguments you'd find in reality. "But I'm a muslim!" Hahaha."

Trying to juggle the wedding arrangements whilst winning a lucrative new contact for his business is taking it's strain on a man of whom, it might reasonably be said, has only a modest grasp on things! A purple envelope arrives, offering him a night of passion with a stranger. He throws it away, but the premiss gets under his skin and he succumbs for a blind-folded experience to remember. Thing is - he can't forget her and is soon trying to find out more about his enigmatic hostess. It's becoming an obsession that could jeopardise everything he holds dear. Cummings is on great form, certainly, but sadly the rest of it all just fell by the wayside a little. To me, it was always reasonably obvious whom the mysterious lady actually was, and "Jordan" is actually quite an odious, unlikeable character that I quickly took against. Whilst maybe that shouldn't have prejudiced my view of the rest of the film, I found I just didn't like him, nor what he stood for either as a husband (to be) or as a rather smarmy, bullish**ter of a business man and so my interest started to wane quite rapidly. He wrote and directed this with co-star PJ McCabe ("PJ") so perhaps an objective set of eyeballs on the whole operation might have given it more depth - padded out the other characters a bit more, rather than just presenting us with as series of powerful, increasingly expletive-laden, monologues from the star that though potent in the beginning, became a little relentless and repetitive as the plot developed. They have also taken a pretty oblique look at just how little we know about the data we inadvertently provide when using the internet, or about the even less we know about how that data is extrapolated and exploited - but that is almost incidental to the "who was the woman?" element that drives the story. It's short and compact, with an end-to-end performance that is to be commended in isolation. The story itself is, however, much less remarkable."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11738830/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," a smiley jerk ","Greetings again from the darkness. Writer-director-editor-actor Jim Cummings' 2018 film THUNDER ROAD was quite popular on the festival circuit, and Cummings is back with another story of a stressed out man ... at a time when the world doesn't much care about stressed out men, especially those who carry themselves with a heavy dose of self-importance. Cummings and co-writer, co-director, and co-star PJ McCabe have delivered a satire on traditional Hollywood in the shape of a whodunit with dark comedy that teeters into thriller territory.Cummings stars as Jordan Hines, a high-octane Hollywood agent who talks as quickly and incessantly as he smiles, and neither are sincere. Jordan is an unlikable guy who belittles the support staff and mostly patronizes his fianc Caroline (Virginia Newcomb, THE DEATH OF DICK LONG, 2019), while kissing the proverbial tushes of prospective clients. One day a mysterious elegant purple envelope shows up in Jordan's mail. It's an invitation to meet up with an admirer for anonymous, no-strings attached sex (as if that's even possible when someone has targeted you). He initially trashes the envelope, before reconsidering.After the encounter, Jordan's personality becomes unhinged and his world begins to crumble. He wants to know who the woman was and why he was chosen. His desperate obsession with locating the mystery woman means his work suffers, as does his relationship with Caroline. Jordan's fantasy has turned into a nightmare that causes him to see and hear things - and he's unable to discern his visions from reality. This fast-talking agent teeters between viable and obsolete, and an "I'm so excited" montage fits perfectly into the persona of a man who lacks sincerity, doesn't know himself, and is oblivious to the needs of others.There are some comparisons here to Jeremy Piven's character in "Entourage" and Patrick Bateman/Christian Bale in AMERICAN PSYCHO, but Cummings make the character his own. The comedy is dark and satirical, but the film never seems sure of itself as it bounds between erotic thriller (with very little eroticism), a 'who is she' mystery, and commentary on how a certain type of individual is no longer welcome in a post-Harvey proper society.The opening sequence is no slow start, as it features a brutally violent murder - an incident that doesn't find its place until near the end of the film. Also included here is cautionary tale on the dark web, and the dangers of social media and the internet, although this feels like an add-on, rather than a fully developed sub-plot. Virginia Newcomb does get to deliver the film's best line, "I'm not insulting you. I'm describing you". Also giving the story a contemporary feel is the emphasis on packaging deals, which is a relevant topic in the ongoing discussions with industry unions. There is a lot tossed in here, and some parts work better than others."

It begins with an extremely disturbing scene, which perhaps sends out a misleading signal regarding where this one is headed, as while it is indeed a sinister tale, the intensity of its opening sequence is full on.

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11738830/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," A Dark Look Into A Familiar Game ","A realistic and gritty peek at the highly sensitive topic of 'what really goes on in Hollywood', "The Beta Test" was not only well written and ideally directed - kudos to both Jim Cummings and PJ McCabe - but it also splendidly portrayed the depravities of show business, and how easy it is to lose so much by giving in to temptation.Jordan (played by Jim Cummings) was the character at the heart of the plot, and he was every bit as compelling and captivating as he needed to be. Jim's performance - I've seen his previous work - has genuinely evolved in "The Beta Test". His 'professional partner' PJ McCabe also co-starred; as himself. He too brought good work to the table. Caroline (played by Virginia Newcomb) gave a seamless and memorable performance.Musical scoring by Jeffrey Campbell Binner and Ben Lovett made so much work on behalf of this film. Kenneth Wales's cinematography was 'familiar' but enthralling regardless - each scene just dragged me in.Between remarkable performances from all cast members and smart editing (again, Jim Cummings), "The Beta Test" accrued an almost documentary-level depth of truth-telling potential. Good hair-makeup and production design (Charlie Textor) further added to its credibility. Noteworthy costume design (Stephani Lewis) as well.This movie was about representation in Hollywood, and the ways agents (like Jordan and PJ) bamboozle their clients and make it seem like 'business as usual'. The movie also captured practical temptations and the ways people, agents included, give in to it at the risk of their careers. It's a destructive cycle that just keeps taking.My opinion... In the movie, they placed a hacker (played by Kevin Changaris) in the orchestrator's seat but he's only a symbolic placeholder for real-life individuals and organizations that do much the same on a grander scale for political (and control) purposes. This even spreads beyond Hollywood.The 'male gaze', sexual and domestic abuse, cheating and explicit affairs, forbidden and inappropriate temptations, and the incredible secrecy that wraps it all under a pall of silence... "The Beta Test" by Jim Cummings and team has a lot to teach, and more to offer, to anyone capable of 'viewing between the frames'.Its 'in your face' script seems, in my understanding, part of the future of storytelling in show business. The message that Caroline shares with Jordan near the end of the film was dialogue-gold. The team has established a radical new way to make movies in this day and age. That fact alone is worth giving this film a view, and all the support it can receive."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11738830/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," More than a Beta test ","If you love "Thunder Road" and "The Wolf of Snow Hollow", written, directed and main acting by Jim Cummings, which were very well received by the movie buffs, you will equally love "The Beta Test". This movie is part a satire and part topsy-turvy thriller. The movie and the plot are not perfect but there is no need for perfection here. The acting performance of both Jim Cummings (Jordan) and PJ McCabe (PJ) are just sublime. And it is always a pleasure to see Jim Cummings displaying all his talents. He is truly one of the most underrated actors today.As the film gets going, we learn Jordan is going to be married soon to Caroline (Virginia Newcomb), about whom Jordan and the film itself seem to have so little interest, apart from making fun of her obsession with her upcoming nuptials, that we don't even know what she does for a living.When a purple envelope arrives in the mail offering Jordan a chance to meet an "admirer" for "anonymous no-strings-attached sex" at a hotel, he hems and haws over the invite and it's enclosed RSVP card and finally fills it out. But elsewhere in Los Angeles other couples who have signed up for similar encounters are facing dire consequences, including murderous spouses. Will this be just as bad for Jordan, too, or even worse, damage his career?All the black comedy is terrific. The stuff about Jordan hunting down who sent the invitation for the hook-up is exciting. The dialogues are clever and custom made for the characters.A very good plot, story, acting, filming, dialogues and a nice twist at the end. What else you need to go and watch this movie?"

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11741044/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," A Beautiful and Haunting Hawaiian Film ","I Was a Simple Man is a beautiful, haunting, and rewarding film. I recently saw the film's premiere at Sundance (virtually) where both of the virtual screenings sold out, which is an indicator of the film's intrigue. In I Was a Simple Man, director Christopher Makoto Yogi tells the story of a dying man named Masao on the North Shore of Oahu. We realize after some interactions with family that Masao is in no way a simple man and has quite a complicated past. He is a man who fell deeply in love with his wife, but after her death decades ago he chose to have very little involvement with his children, which leaves him mostly isolated on his deathbed. I connected with this storyline deeply, particularly during this pandemic when many of us are confronting death to an extent that we never have before, and also feel incredibly isolated at the same time. Days later the film has me grappling mentally with deaths in my own family and the complex, sometimes flawed personal relationships that greatly complicate our emotions when death comes around.The story touches on a lot of interesting topics, some that might be familiar to those who have seen Yogi's previous work. The characters and script are nostalgic for an old Hawaii, one not littered with high rise hotels and apartment buildings, and one that is more green and untouched. Hawaiian nature is deeply linked to the characters and is a focal point visually, aurally, and symbolically. The complicated issue of Hawaiian statehood also creates a layered backdrop to the story that unfolds in the past.The performances by the actors and cultivated by Yogi are impressive. Constance Wu is probably the draw here, but this is not your typical Wu project. In fact, I was most appreciative of the subtle acting of relative newcomer Steve Iwamoto in the lead role, whose tanned and weathered face expressed so much. I was also impressed by Tim Chiou who played "Adult Masao" during some of the most difficult times for his character.Regarding the film's style, I Was a Simple Man would be categorized in the genre of Slow Cinema and is rewarding to those with some patience. Perhaps this pacing will not be for everyone, but I found that it created a meditative and thoughtful tone that felt intentionally and deeply in tune with the Hawaiian environment where "time moves differently," which is also a reference to the film's fluid chronology. Though some of the boldest choices come later in the film, most of which I'll refrain from spoiling, I found the film to be quite dynamic as it builds towards its conclusion. The film's cinematography is quite gorgeous, showcasing a less familiar side of Hawaii, and featuring frames reminiscent of Ozu. The sound design is incredible, providing the Hawaiian environment life and vibrancy through powerful crescendos and hard cuts. When combined with the haunting score, I found myself quite moved or even rattled emotionally as the drama unfolded. Overall the film is quite the unique and profound sensory experience.Ultimately, I Was a Simple Man was the perfect antidote to so much binging of generic Netflix series that I think we all are having to resort to these days. I was deeply affected by the film and I'm still thinking about it days later. If you're looking to watch something refreshing, different, and thoughtful, then I would highly recommend checking out I Was a Simple Man. I think it will go down as one of my favorites of the year."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11741044/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Slow, sometimes indecisive meditation on life ","About 30 minutes into this film, there is a quick, almost fleeting shot of a rotten fruit falling from a tree at nighttime, paired with a shot of the fragile main character as he lies on his deathbed. A little while earlier, we see him attentively picking fresh fruit from the same tree, the sun blazing overhead. It might just be a small visual detail, but this contrast stood out most to me amid all the frames director Christopher Makoto Yogi interweaves in this film.I Was a Simple Man is an almost mystical story of an elderly man, Masao, nearing the end of his life. Over the course of the movie, we explore the circumstances that shaped him into the solitary man he eventually becomes through revisiting shattering experiences, and happy memories-all while life is slowly slipping out of his worn out body. Yogi gives these experiences time and space to unfold, never once rushing the reflective nature of the film; instead, he lets the film slowly lure us in by merging different timelines and points of view. This is a movie that doesn't need many words to "talk", it's a movie that thoughtfully conveys its message through pictures, like fruit falling from a tree.The first two acts are filled with color and stunning Hawaiian scenery, accompanied by the tranquil sound of waves breaking softly on the shore. As the film goes on, however, some of its initial heart and care unfortunately get lost along the way, in my view. Although the initial premise-centered around an experience we will all inevitably go through-feels universal, the movie isn't fully able to take us on the same journey as its protagonist, subsequently reducing the film's emotional impact to a minimum, despite its visibly heartfelt direction and performances. Since most of the story is told through flashbacks, there is almost no character development otherwise crucial to the emotional tone of a dramatic film like this one.As a result, the overall tone and atmosphere of I Was a Simple Man feels indecisive; it's as if the film and its message got lost somewhere in the cuts between present and past, reality and fantasy. Both the flashbacks and the present timeline work well on their own, with solid cinematography and strong narratives; put together, however, they feel rather dissonant than harmonious-like melodies each beautiful by themselves, but played together, they become a discordant sea of notes without a clear phrase or harmony.A contemplative movie exploring the end of a man's time spent on earth, I Was a Simple Man seeks to convey the feeling of being in the presence of someone who is passing away-Yogi's main inspiration behind this film, as he mentioned during the Q&A following the screening. While this movie succeeds at painting a pensive portrait of a man's life, it unfortunately doesn't succeed as much at interweaving the story of his life with the passing of his life. Nonetheless, in the end, I Was a Simple Man is perhaps a mindful reminder that our lives are to be lived, and lived fully, before we depart this planet."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11742798/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Quite enjoyable actually... ","Granted, as I sat down to watch the 2021 movie "Afterlife of the Party", I wasn't really expecting it to be a movie that would prove all that entertaining to me. Why? Well, solely because the movie's cover/poster looked like something that would appeal to a whole different audience group. But then I read the movie's synopsis, and figured I would give the movie a chance.And I am glad that I did, because writer Carrie Freedle actually managed to write a rather enjoyable script and storyline here. And "Afterlife of the Party" is the type of movie that puts a smile on your lips and makes you feel good. Yeah, there was definitely some good and positive energies coming from this movie. So thumbs up to director Stephen Herek for this accomplishment.Sure, the storyline was a bit cheesy if you step back and take a look at it. But it actually made for proper and good entertainment in my book. And I was surprised to find that this wasn't a movie that was specifically aiming at a female audience.The acting in the movie was good, and not being familiar with neither Victoria Justice or Midori Francis, I must say that I definitely think they were well-cast for their respective roles, and they put on a good performances and brought their characters to life on the screen in very convicing ways.If you have the opportunity to sit down and watch "Afterlife of the Party", you should definitely do so, because this is a heartfelt movie. I was genuinely entertained by this movie, and it is one that I can warmly recommend you watch.My rating of "Afterlife of the Party" lands on a six out of ten stars."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11742798/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," Average... ",""Afterlife of the Party" is a Drama - Fantasy movie in which we watch a young woman dying after a party during her birthday week. She returns to fix her broken relationships and close her unfinished business on Earth.The description of the movie says everything about it without having anything else to expect. An average movie with no surprises or plot twists to become interesting. It follows the same clich of all romantic movies something that makes it boring and you feel that already know what is going to happen or how it will end. The interpretations of both Midori Francis who played as Lisa and Victoria Justice who played as Cassie followed the same pattern of the movie without making any difference. Finally, I have to say that "Afterlife of the Party" is an average movie and I do not recommend it to anyone."

She portrayed her character pretty well, gave some decent emotions, and most importantly wasn't annoying.Although the story was interesting, I did not like the tone. The cast of the movie reflected the less serious tone. I hated this because the content of the story itself should have been serious and contemplating. I didn't really feel most of the emotions and impact of the themes at the end.Also, not all of the parts of the story worked.

When she dies, however, she has to complete pending matters that will determine whether she is going to go "up" (heaven) or "down" (hell). Eventually she will have to manage to bring out her best and change her attitude in life to complete the to-do list. Despite the obvious dramatic body of the film, the whole film is completely light from the beginning and has nothing to do with drama. Especially the beginning seems quite disappointing for someone who wants something more serious with a philosophical style and feeling. Only towards the end does it has an emotion that "cleanses" the soul. Overall, it's enjoyable to watch, but teens and young adults alike will love it."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11742798/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Good premise ","This movie has a good premise but the execution doesn't convince me.It has a promising script, but it rambles a lot about telling the story in a concrete way, although for most of the film the sentimentalities are balanced, the ending is very cheesy and a bit predictable. I really like the plot and why it happens like this, there are good acting, good production design and good character development.Even though there are a lot of script holes and the ending is cheesy and a bit convenient, the story is entertaining and at some point endearing, it's worth giving it a try."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11742798/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Touching & Funny ","I really enjoyed this movie. The acting was decent enough and the characters were interesting. It wasn't perfect and some scenes could've been done better, but the story is still quite moving. I had a few laughs and shed a few tears.Here's the breakdown. Cassie is always the life of the party. She goes out to a club/bar with her best friend, Lisa, one night. Cassie then decided to move the party, while an upset Lisa goes home. The next morning, Cassie is back in her apartment and wakes up with a hangover. There were many ways she could've died before this. I kept wondering when it would happen. It was very underwhelming but funny with how it went down. Watch to find out.Anyway, Cassie gets to the waiting area between Above (Heaven) and Below (hell). She meets her caseworker Angel who gives her a list of people who must be helped, in order for her to go to the Above. Cassie only has until her birthday to complete her mission. She has several rocky starts, but eventually starts finding her way. Sometimes her helpfulness is obtrusive, but everything works out in the end.I've read several other reviews and haven't seen anyone mention her outfits. When Cassie was alive, her fashion was an integral part of her identity. This didn't change just because she died. As an Angel, Cassie was able to have a different outfit each day. What I loved was that at first, her clothing is just as flashy and glamorous as when she was alive. But each day, her outfits became more plain and muted. Like she became part of the background at the end, instead of trying to stand out. I think this is because at first, Cassie's main goal was to get into the Above. How would helping those on her list benefit her? But as she was helping her friends and family, her priorities changed. Helping them live their lives without her became her new goal. She finally put others before herself and her outfits reflected her change of heart."

It reminded me I also had Friend unfortunately we aren't friends anymore after 9 years and somehow I didn't knew why I didn't reconnect and now I think we outgrow her friendship and it really hurt cause I didn't made friends after that cause friends you had from the childhood days or friend from school are hard to come by once you progress into real world .. I did even cried once Cassie hugged her dad ..that was a beautiful..I wanted to watch for Victoria but I'm glad I did ..it a worth of my time."

Now she has to return to Earth to right her wrongs with important people in her life including best friend Lisa (Midori Francis). With the help of her guardian angel Val (Robyn Scott), Cassie has only days to make an impact on everyone's lives.Right off the bat, the concept will draw you in. There have been countless films that deal with the afterlife, some better than others. There are some nice setting throughout the make the viewing experience a little more enjoyable. Some well-timed jokes also help bring this film to life.The biggest drawback is the feeling of a drawn out episode of short-lived television series. The pacing was not there and it missed a lot of beats. The acting throughout was bearable, with Lisa and her love interest Max (Timothy Renouf) being the exception. They had great chemistry and the film would have benefited from making their story the focal point. With their quirky careers and awkward personalities, it could have been a hit.Life of the Afterparty has great intentions and there is for sure a massive market for it, but to the general audience, it misses the mark. Going full romantic comedy with Lisa and Max, and Cassie as the guardian angel match maker, would have been the better version."

The highlight of the movie is the theme song which concludes the storyline: "I want a role", while the other tracks bring in these special rock vibes from 30 years ago. Moreover, the leading roles and characters of Mihail Bilalov, Irini Jambonas and Lilia Maravilya have amazing chemistry together and this surely led to a number of well-delivered dramatic scenes during the climax of the film. To sum up, the movie has good quality, the storyline is simple but the actors and the songs create the real lovely value that it has!"

He was the first Indian to set foot in football. He formed about 12/13 clubs. In 180 Nagendra formed the Wellington Club. But the 'Native Indians' had no place in the British game. Nagendra's promise was to defeat the British in the game. Nagendra started the 'Wellington' club in association with 'Friends', 'Boys' and 'Presidency' clubs, but for some reason it broke up. Durand Cup is not played. Later, Nagendra, along with Raja Ananda krishna Dev and other powerful people, formed the Shobha bazar Club. And dreams of playing in the 'Trades Cup' final. Where his main opponent is Major Jackson's team. The stage of Nagendra s team formation has come up nicely in the film. Football is a team game. Nagendra can show the direction, victory does not come in a single fight! People from all walks of life took place in his group.

It's far superior to the majority of what's currently available on Netflix. The film was meant to be good, as it was directed by George Tounas and written by Tounas with co-writer Christos Arfanis. Those two guys have got their films screened at a number of film festivals despite their modest budget films. As a result, success was certain, and it was most likely sure to happen.Every scene is merely a preparation for getting from one location to the next, thus the audience will not quickly become bored or confused, but instead focus on the action rather than the low budget. Kudos to the writers for that. The action is usually funny, with excellent choreography and tense martial arts clashes, which are exhibited with zeal when the fearsome protagonist (played by Tounas) kicks down the bad guys.Tounas and Arfanis' "Reloaded" mostly succeeds in being inadvertently hilarious, which adds an unexpected layer of entertainment value that the filmmakers couldn't have anticipated when they intended to make an action picture.I rent "Reloaded" on Amazon, but it should be available on Netflix."

I see Arfanis has some experience on screenwriting, so maybe this is why. Tounas also has some other movies as well, but their dialogues are inferior compared to Reloaded. I watched his movies on YouTube, and I watched Reloaded on Amazon DE.Despite the great writing, the acting and direction is average. The direction could be better. The actors are skilled, but they appear lazy and bored. I blame the lazy direction. It feels like a movie shot in a day.Even though the lazy and sleepy actors, I love everyone in here, all the characters and the lead character.

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11760236/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," Far better than expected ","Taking a road trip through the desert, a woman and her friend trying to make an appointment in the city are stranded by an accident near a supposedly abandoned ghost town where they find a genetically-engineered dinosaur is running loose and must try to outsmart it and get away alive.Overall, this one turned out to be quite fun for the most part. One of the better features here is the somewhat enjoyable setup that allows them to spend time in the eerie abandoned town. Featuring the roadside accident in the middle of the desert while out on their trip, this part offers a fine initial factor to get them stranded and explore the town. These here are generally eerie and chilling, as their eerieness of being alone in the desert, the fading light, and inability to recognize anyone around them in the creepy location by themselves offer up a great start to this one. With that setup in place, the film's quite enjoyable with a fun series of dinosaur attacks. After the first attack on the worker and the first escape scenes where it tries to take out the others around the town, it all leads perfectly into the fantastic series of cat-and-mouse chases throughout the night as the action picks up nicely. The series of escapes, near-misses, and trap attempts that go alongside the suspense of the creature chasing them throughout the town and the ingenuity of managing to get out of the situation is great fun, and with the incredible effects-work on the creature gives this a lot to like. There isn't much to hold this back, and it all comes in the final half with this one doing a complete turn-around from the kind of film it had been before. After giving the escape and reveal of what's going on, the utterly bizarre twist here revolving around the stand-up comedy routine and resulting dream here is completely ridiculous and feels completely removed from the type of content that was on display before. It's not interesting or exciting, just illogical and nonsensical as well as quite idiotic, and along with the lack of gore at all generates the few flaws on display.Rated Unrated/R: Graphic Language and Violence."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11760236/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," Self-destructed at the finish line. ","A note about my rating system: because I rate on a highly subjective, relativistic scale, virtually any movie can achieve a 10/10 rating with me. After all, nothing prevents even the very cheapest of movies from telling a great story. A limited budget and amateur actors needn't cripple a movie in the hands of enthusiastic and devoted makers. And so on.Just as uninspired workmanship can flush a giant budget down the toilet, so can talent and enthusiasm carry the day for the poverty-stricken. You'd be surprised how your old aunt Mabel and best pal Cooter can reach for the stars on their Walmart lunch break last Tuesday. A 10/10 is within the grasp of any movie that cares enough to rise above itself and reach for it.And, sadly, it's precisely because of this truth that CLAW was so disappointing. For about 90% of the movie, CLAW was sailing along, high and proud, and was well on its way to getting at least a 9/10 and had the potential of even a top 10/10.And then CLAW literally self-destructed right at the finish line. The writer/director (mostly the same person) somehow lost control or simply went insane and CLAW transmogrified back into the moldy pumpkin from whence it came. Somehow, watching the movie, which had been doing so well, suddenly sprout warts out of nowhere was more disturbing than if it had simply been garbage all along.I can't be certain, of course, but the impression that I got was that the writer/director couldn't figure out how to end the movie. And so we got a cheesy ending feint of a dream sequence followed by an even worse dream-echo sequence where a full-grown Tyrannosaurus rex just shows up out of nowhere and peeks in through the window. Rawr.For most of the movie, CLAW had a sort of original TREMORS buddy/monster movie kind of vibe going for it. Structurally, it was almost identical to TREMORS where we have an unjustifiably-present monster effectively just thrown on stage (a premise you're just supposed to accept out of goodwill, apparently) and then the bulk of the movie is our unlikely duo attempting to come to terms and survive in a remote location, with no hope of help, while creatively fending off this monster that wants to eat them.In CLAW, the two leads did a surprisingly high quality acting job and were very engaging/believable. The simple setting, premise and chase-scene sensibilities in combination with engaging and believable leads was working an excellent chemistry, and then, without warning, the whole thing just took a turn for the stupid.What a shame."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11762434/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","3"," I think they spent all the budget on Bruce Willis and had nothing left for writing, props, actors and more. ","I noticed that "Cosmic Sin" recently made it to IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 list and has a pitiful score of only 2.5! So, not only is it on the list...but it is way up the list at #39!When I first started watching this sci-fi film, I could IMMEDIATELY see why the film is so hated. It's a film set in the 26th century and at this time, there is space travel and life on many planets and moons. So, why do you see folks driving pickup trucks that look like they are from 2021? Why are the clothes pretty much what you'd see today and why are most of the weapons not much more effective or different than today's?! It honestly looks like they must have spend all their budget on securing Bruce Willis' talents and had nothing left to make it look like a futuristic story. Now I don't think you need expensive props to make a good film...but this is ridiculous and really takes you out of the story.The story begins with some form of life being discovered on some new planet. It seems that up until this time, humans have never made first contact with any intelligent species...even with humans inhabiting many new worlds. As you'd expect, this new form of sentient life is not sweet and friendly....as who would want to see a film like that?! And, it turns out that it is so deadly that in the entire galaxy (numbering many, many, many billions) the only guy that can stop the creatures is a war criminal, James Ford (Willis)!I have seen much worse films that never made it to the IMDB list...mostly because they are older, cheaper and more obscure. In other words, the Bottom 100 is very heavily skewed to new films...so although the film is bad, it's not the 39th worst film ever made! I think it's just that a lot of folks get Netflix and had a chance to see it...whereas far less folks have seen the films of Ed Wood, Al Adamson, Ray Dennis Steckler and William Grefe...all filmmakers who REALLY knew how to make terrible films...REALLY terrible films!So is there anything good about this movie? Some of the CGI space scenes are very nice and would probably look great on the big screen (though I assume this film, when it came out, only went straight to Netflix and Amazon Prime). Otherwise, the story is not especially interesting, the dialog often pretty bad and the acting not especially good. It is not completely awful...just mostly awful. And, unfortunately not so bad that it's fun to watch in order to make fun of the film.By the way, nearly all the reviews for this are extremely negative. With this and a score of 2.5, I am amazed to find some folks giving it 10s! A few admit that it's bad but are just trolling or love it because it's so bad. A few, however, are VERY short reviews that talk about how brilliant it is...a sure sign normally of fake reviews done by folks connected with the film...which is pretty shameful."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11762434/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","3"," cinematic sin ","Some 500 years in the future, mankind has spread into the cosmos. On a faraway planet, humans have encountered First Contact. An alien presence infects people and turns them into marauding zombies. James Ford (Bruce Willis) is a disgraced military leader arguing for the doomsday Q-bomb. Engineer Fiona Ardene (Adelaide Kane) is called in to prep the device. General Ryle (Frank Grillo) leads the soldiers while Dr. Lea Goss (Perrey Reeves) is awed by the aliens.First thing first, this movie opens with an info-dump in text form. It's a lot of gobbledygook. Someone should try to read it again. Then there is the awkward mix of present-day technology with the future tech. There is no logical reason for it. It's an obviously sign of bad budgeting and unimaginative set design. When that happens, they are better off putting the movie in a smaller space and as much future tech onto the screen. At least, put some effort in giving the characters some future-cars. Its greater sin is that it's boring. I think I must have spaced out. One moment, they're fighting zombies in the warehouse and the next, they're space-diving to another planet. It's a forgettable muddle."

","Ah yes, a movie that's finally described by it's own title. This film doesn't require a long review because it's just too disjointed for a coherent story line, what with all those scenes that look like they might be dream sequences or flashbacks to another time and place. They just don't seem to connect to what's going on in the main picture. Sad to say, I was looking for Bruce Willis to break out of his recent string of dismal flicks to really make an impact in this one, but he just looked way tired of the whole thing as Blood General James Ford, the banished soldier who dropped a Q-bomb on planet Zafdie to wipe out seventy million people. All for a good cause of course, because they were on the way to secede from the Alliance with Earth and Ellora. Ford has the film's most prescient bit of dialog, which I've put in my summary line for you. Along with the title, it pretty much says everything you need to know about this sci-fi travesty."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11762434/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","3"," What a disappointment this was... ","Granted, I have to admit that I was lured in to watching the 2021 movie "Cosmic Sin" given the movie's cover/poster and the fact that the movie was starring Bruce Willis, Frank Grillo and Costas Mandylor.And let me just come right out and say that writers Edward Drake and Corey Large failed to deliver a wholesome movie here with "Cosmic Sin". While I managed to sit through the entire ordeal, then I must say that all throughout the course of the entire movie I was sitting with an overwhelming sense of pointlessness. I just couldn't find anything worthwhile in the storyline, and everything seemed just bland and without a cause.It was so difficult to indulge myself into the storyline because it was so linear and anything but interesting and exciting. So the end result that is "Cosmic Sin" from director Edward Drake was just a very forgettable and rather mundane movie. The storyline was just so amazingly generic and linear that you could have left the movie for a longer period of time, and returned only to be right up to speed with the storyline.Now, I am sure that die-hard fans - pardon the pun - of Bruce Willis or Frank Grillo might actually find some kind of odd enjoyment here in the movie. I, however, didn't. So this movie was a swing and a miss.I must admit that it felt that Bruce Willis wasn't really committed to this movie project, and his performance felt half-hearted, as if he was running on auto-pilot. And Frank Grillo just wasn't given enough on-screen time to manage to do much of anything to salvage the movie.The characters in the movie were every bit as bland and pointless as the storyline. So you don't really connect with any of them, nor do you form any kind of attachments to any of them. So whether they live or die, it hardly matters.Now, what did work for "Cosmic Sin" was the visuals. They had some nice enough suits for the soldiers of the Alliance. And the weapon effects were quite good. The aliens, however, they just felt like something out of a B movie. So that was disappointing to say the least.All in all, "Cosmic Sin" was exactly what the movie title says; a cosmic sin. This movie came and went without leaving much of any blast mark or memorable impression. My rating of "Cosmic Sin" lands on a mere three out of ten stars."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11762434/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","2"," What was this even about? ","A terribly written trash heap that made no sense, the storyline was disjointed to say the least. The effects were okay. But what good there was is overshadowed by poor acting and bad dialogue. Almost laughably bad."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11762434/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","1"," Bad. ","Cosmic Sin is goofy, with thriller dance, tower defense, nonsense. Bad characters, intangible silly plot, yawn end please."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11762434/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","3"," Low ratings are in this case completely justified. ","Bruce Willis is becoming the new Nicholas Cage. It looks like he's just accepting any role without reading the script, something Nicholas Cage seems to do as well. Not that I think Bruce Willis is a great actor, he just played in some good movies, but he's not a great actor, and lately he's been actually really bad. It's going downhill for Bruce Willis. Cosmic Sin is just bad, with a story that is badly written, special effects that looked from another century, and actors that don't seem to know what they're doing. I wish I could unwatch this piece of garbage."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11762434/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","3"," It was simply awful ","Bruce Willis stopped telegraphing his acting for this film. He just didn't act at all. I mean, it looked like he was between high and mentally disabled. I worry about the dude. Then Frank Grillo, happenstance makes that I have seen three of his films this week, I was just saying how I wish he would get a break. Not for this film! Note that he is billed first, above Willis, and his role is at most 15 minutes from the film anyway.But what makes this film shine like a black hole is the story. It felt more than devoid of passion, like a spreadsheet that sucks one's soul away in the accounting department on a hot day after the air conditioning died. I mean, if a kid would have written it, it at least would have been fun. If someone was incompetent it would have felt like trying to send some kind of message, however badly. But no, it ... just made no sense, like someone hated writing for this film.Bottom line: it is so bad you can't even enjoy it wasted. It's a non-movie. It's like what's on the other side of the event horizon of TV static."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11762434/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","3"," A Faint Potential For A Engaging Sci Fi Movie Falls To Poor Writing and Execution ","In Cosmic Sin the 26th Century still using way outdated hand weapons (eventually even a grenade) and pick-up trucks and honking vehicles on a street and parked motorcycles and even cigarettes indistinguishable from the 1960s. The Nostromo from the Alien (1979) had a way much better med unit. Early scenes after the good and bad introductory mystery have of course the requisite robotic servers and hologram (country?) singers and a barfight with a slight difference with again the old-fashioned side arms and the Calvary with an attempt at twinge of an alternative outcome that really is not.There are major storyline problems with the quarantine procedures even simple glass windows and even a typical "gun" fight, yet there was an initial attempt at fascinating underlying dynamic taking place however with the first contact encounter scenes and subsequent reflective commentary. Then somehow a brief firefight does not flow well, problems with editing arise, a scene very underdeveloped, and supposedly a well-manned defensive team becomes at risk of being actually overrun. Instead of a quickening climatic pace, the energy seems to dissipate and slow down along with almost no high-tech, futuristic surveillance networks to warn of impending attacks becomes more combat scenes from a mediocre World War II movie with elements from Stargate (1994) and worse yet the climatic battle is something that would be more like out of a World War I engagement and lame hand to hand sequences and a limp effort a riveting emotional end. The screenwriters were definitely not up the job and no actor could improve on a thin script that had the promise but not the actual substance to translate into a credible movie. This movie even reverted to absolutely unnecessary cowboy, western era musical harmonics while Bruce Willis strangely just seems to fade almost completely away by the end of the movie.The major problem with Cosmic Sin lies with the screenwriters trying too hard to be cute and offer up something substance, different, and try to incorporate too many fancy relational and philosophical ideas. They failed in their execution and omitted too many important backstories to offer audiences a sense of plot flow. Instead the audience is sort of just dropped into this movie without the understanding of what the real motives of what is going on. The audience is forced to play catch up. The writers fall into their own traps with the only way out of empty ideas is to create overly convenient ways to extricate themselves out of various corners (i.e., where a general loses face for backing down on his own orders, the awkward political dynamics of the military decisions being made, past undisclosed relationships).Maybe the only nice surprise of this movie is the character and what some people might call a cameo performance of Lochlyn Munro. He appears to have finally broken out of his typecast of either simple bad guy or side character in a slew of romantic comedies. Munro had a decent performance here."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11762434/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","1"," Really Not Worth the Effort ","I sort of wonder whether there is a minimum word count for IMDB reviews, but then again I suspect there isn't if the number of reviews that appear that simply say 'I created an account to give this movie one star' is anything to go by. Mind you, those reviews generally don't tell me all that much, though the star rating generally does go to help the final score, not that this tells me anything these days with the number of single review accounts that seem to appear with all of the movies these days.However, this movie definitely deserves one star - it is bad - really, really bad. Okay, I was pretty tired when I watched this film, and found it rather difficult to follow, and normally that would suggest that maybe I should watch this film again. However, this film literally have the lowest rating that I have seen of any film on IMDB - and that is definitely saying something. It sounds as if nobody who watched the film enjoyed it. In fact, nobody has even bothered to write a synopsis on Wikipedia.What is it about? Honestly, I'm not all that sure. Is it an alien invasion that the people of Earth have to stop, or are they zombies trying to take over the Earth, and the people of Earth have to stop them. Yeah, it is pretty confusing, and doesn't seem to really have a coherent plot. Also, what is this thing about going out and destroying the aliens before they can, well, take over the Earth? That doesn't seem to be the type of thing that we should be advocating.Yeah, this film was incredibly painful to watch, and I really couldn't wait for it to be over. Sure, I could have simply walked out of the cinema, but I really don't like doing that - at all. I pretty much like to hang around until the end. Sure, I might watch it again if it appears on Netflix, but then again with all of the other films out there that I could be wasting my time watching, this one isn't going to be high on my list."

In this case I at least thought I would get Frank Grillo as the actual star of the movie but as it turns out he's also phoning this one with Willis. Guest he can do that after making that money In the Marvel Cinematic Universe flicks.The movie has a complex plot about survival of the fittest on an interstellar level, which was pretty much wrapped up in the trailer of the film and never really goes any further.I would love to tell you how action packed this film is but that falls short as well. It feels set up to be fluffed with action but its all lame .The only thing I truly got a kick out of was the cheap Sci-fi. You could tell they were trying to turn 20 bucks into 200 million, but sometimes those failures can give a movie charm. They had some visual effects scenes that were filmed perfectly and some of the costumes were so stylish i could not keep my eyes off of them (Making it easier to see all their flaws)If you want a really good Bruce Willis is just on the poster movie checkout Extraction, it's perfect. I would leave this one alone."

","The premise has been done in other horror sci -fi films that where much better than this, I'm sure we remember Aliens(1979), hardly anybody here grabs your interest, even the Bruce Willis character who looks barely awake through out most of this, looking like he hasn't slept since Glass(2019), appears he did this movie for a pay check, other than that he looks very bored through this whole thing.Now the effects are pretty descent, and Frank Grillo and Costas Mandylor seem to be only actors giving it there all, cause neither one appear to be sleepwalking through this, even though both probably know this film is gonna be bad, but glad to say the both where being professional. But the film seems edit down, not giving enough time for anything for the plot to evolve."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11762434/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," Bad 'B' Sci-fi ","I saw "Cosmic Sin", starring Frank Grillo-the Purge movies, Captain America:The Winter Soldier; Bruce Willis-Breach, Glass; Costas Mandylor-Born Champion, the Saw movies and Perrey Reeves-Old School, Child's Play 3. This is a bad 'B' sci_fi movie with Bruce Willis getting second billing-you know there is something wrong there. He just recently made another cheap sci_fi movie, Breach, so I guess he must like them-either that or maybe he owes somebody money or a favor. Anyway, this one takes place in 2524, when the earth has colonized some other planets, some of which were inhabited. Bruce was a war hero-he killed a bunch of aliens-but some people didn't like the way he did it, so he was discharged unceremoniously. Some aliens attack a group of earth people on a remote survey planet and Frank-a general-calls in Bruce to do what Bruce likes doing; putting the aliens in their place. Costas is a Sargent in the squad that is assembled and Perrey is a doctor/former love interest to Bruce. Some of the story is a little jumbled and hard to make sense of at times-the aliens are wearing long blazers with hoodies to probably hide the low budget. There are even times when it's hard to tell exactly who the good guys are-the humans or the aliens. Of course, that might have been the producers objective in the first place; to have a debate on war. It's rated "R" for violence and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 28 minutes. I like bad movies-at times-but they do need a coherent storyline, at least. I wouldn't buy this on DVD. I wouldn't rent it either. If you really want to see it, I would wait until it shows up on cable."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11762434/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt"," Better than Breach but a wasted opportunity. ","Set in 2524, the human race has began to colonising planets but after first contact with an alien race dire consequences ensue, forcing a disgraced solider back into service.Thankfully Cosmic Sin is more enjoyable than Breach Bruce Willis' previous sci-fi outing with director Edward Drake. Here he offers another low budget-feeling sci-fi action. The score, some sets, special effects are impressive but it's execution is a little stilted along with the script. That said, there's some breakout moments from the supporting cast, notably Costas Mandylor as frank talking Marcus Bleck.Boasting the likes of Frank Grillo and Willis, both actors are under-utilised. Cosmic Sin works well enough as an Aliens come Star Trek, even Ghosts of Mars derivative. That's said, it's reminiscent of a late 80s, early 90 direct to video science fictions, Nemesis, APEX, Terminal Force etc however, many made during that period were usually innovative, regrettably there's very little to write home about in the case of Cosmic Sin as it meanders from location to another, jumping from one scene to another. In between borrowing lines from other movies. At one point a character says, "This is crazy, I don't need this..." which is exactly how I felt watching. Viewers maybe left wondering how Drake managed to bag such talent on a seemingly lacklustre science fiction as Willis fires bullets into the infected.Overall, if this was made 25 years ago it may have been a VHS DTV hit but despite Drake's efforts and crisp visuals it sadly feels tired and worn."

","When a small group of soliders on a remote planet are attacked by a mysterious alien civilisation another team of soliders headed up by disgraced retired General James Ford must work together and bring the fight to the aliens before they destroy Earth and the various other civilisations...I'm really starting to get sick of Sky Movies and their misleading ratings for films; 4 stars out of 5 this rubbish got from them (so 8 out of 10 on the IMDB scale). After I watched the film I decided to look at its IMDB rating to see what others thought of the film and was relieved to see that I wasn't alone in thinking this was a stinker (it's current rating of 2.5 out of 10 speaks for itself).Although many other people will have doubtlessly explained the many flaws with this film I may as well throw my hat in the ring and give my two penneth...For a start, despite the film only running for around 85-90 minutes it is excruciatingly slow with a practically non-existent storyline; I mean there's no real definitive explanation for what the aliens wanted and why they were attacking these civilisations in the first place? At one point it's mentioned that the aliens don't believe that they can co-exist with other civilisations and therefore effectively rather than destroy the people within the civilisations. They embody the people and use them as hosts to continue their destruction (effectively creating an army). This is summed up in about 30 seconds of dialogue and isn't eluded to again. To say this film lacks depth would be an understatement!!!Still shallow sci-fi isn't always bad, but if you're not going to give your audience a deep and involving story then it's usually a good idea to provide a shedload of action, sharp dialogue, interesting characters and a sense of fun. OK it's asking a lot to see all 4 elements, but even 1 or 2 of these things may have made the film just about bearable, but honestly the film is so colourless and so devoid of personality that it becomes a challenge just to sit through it.The acting is pretty poor as well; Bruce Willis isn't the best actor in the world, but he has appeared in a lot of good films meaning that if he is working with the right director and screenwriter they know this and will play to his strengths. To be honest though, given how bad this film was I think Bruce knew he was starring in a turkey and simply didn't care and therefore put no effort in at all. Everyone else is no better with many of the cast reciting their dialogue in an emotionless manner as though they were reading from an autocue. Oh and by the way guys you're meant to be soldiers so something in the way of camaraderie wouldn't have gone a miss.Believe its abysmal IMDB rating and the 1 or 2 star reviews, save 90 minutes of your life and just skip this rubbish."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11762434/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," ANOTHER CHEAP 'N' CHEESY SCI-FI B-MOVIE WITH WILLIS!!! ","EDWARD DRAKE who directed this very low-budget t.v series like Sci-fi Thriller also had written it & also had written the other Bruce Willis Sci-fi Cheapy ANTI-LIFE (2021) also & that explains why both films are so similar & i thought that as I watching it, i actually said to my wife that Willis must've gotten Deya Vu making this!!! I actually liked ANTI-LIFE better of the two but to be honest they do make a chilled evening of a Double Bill of Willis Sci-fi Thriller's. Now COSMIC SIN is set like it's other half of the Double bill, in the future but this time the world isn't destroyed but just very futuristic (with what the small budget could do) with flying cars/vehicles as well as normal cars too still & robots for a barman in the bars (Similar to Will Smith's i,Robot 2004) & lots of glowing Neon lights & things & for the most part it looks good!!! Yes it's very low-budget but i gotta admit i was impressed with alot of the look & technology they pulled off with cheap c.g.i & practical effects & the basic story is our planet has finally made contact with Alien creatures but they're hostile & when a team return from another planet that they've been stationed on, they come back possessed just like in it's close brother ANTI-LIFE & start killing everyone in the station base & here we get our team of soon-to-be heroes with the rugged old infamous ex-Commander Bruce Willis known as a warmonger due to his brutal past & it's just nice having the old skool Action legend here in such a low-budget production, even if he's only here for the paycheck!!! Willis plays his part like most these days with a calmness & a Coolness & a bad attitude just like he did in Anti-life & many other of his DTV films but i like him here & just by having him lifts its quality. We also get the great B-movie legend FRANK GRILLO who i have loved since THE PURGE: ANARCHY & his Cool, rugged & no-nonsense toughness is on display again in a leader role but to be honest he doesn't get to do the action i expected & wanted but again it's great to have the veteran side by side with Willis. There's a few other familiar faces but it's these two stars is why i wanted to even watch this.I will say this though that i would rather watch this flick or Anti-life over any of the ridiculously mega budget TRANSFORMERS films & more so than many of the over-blown budget trash that is put on the Cinema, Cosmic Sin is small scale but crams in a fun little Sci-fi action story with a Cool Willis leading it all even if he's not exactly giving it his all, still miles better than the usual Steven Seagal DTV flick. Small minimalist budget yes but i see alot of creativity went into creating the look & it's futuristic technology & it does look Good for it's budget!!! At times i got the feel & vibe of a POWER RANGERS episode or movie, especially when they gear up with body armour suits & when they fight the Alien beings (that seem like possessed humans as you Don't ever see their faces or what they really are) the villains come accross as the type that the Power Rangers would battle but hey it's a Low-budget slice of Sci-fi Thriller cheese so i just took it for that. Our team are power boosted through space & land on another planet that is fine for Humans & the rest of the Cheese fest plays on the forest planet with rebels (like STAR WARS) & the action is fine for a cheap flick with laser guns & possessed warriors that also reminded of John Carpenter's Ghost's of Mars just like ANTI-LIFE did too!!!! Many Sci-fi flicks enfluenced this as did ANTI-LIFE & like i said both written by Edward Drake but only this one was directed by him.Cosmic Sin just like Anti-life is a cheap, trashy & cheesy but fun B-movie that's nothing special or great but an easy watch & does make a nice Double bill with ANTI-LIFE. Entertaining & fun."

It takes a miracle to believe that 2021's Cosmic Sin would be viable, sci-fi fare. By the way, Neil Blomkamp called and says he wants his lauded integrity back.So yeah, "Sin" was released in March of this year (its title in India is actually Worthless Rip-Off). It's a direct-to-video flick that also poses as something you'd see on well, the Syfy channel. Cosmic Sin tries to be part Blade Runner, part Ghosts of Mars, part Elysium, and part Aliens. Sadly with its characters bickering back and forth like the Bickersons, "Sin" feels more like 2000's veritable bomb, Supernova.Cosmic Sin is poorly lit in a soft bulb sort of way. It also has action scenes that are choppily edited, actresses you feel sorry for (I'm talking about you Perrey Reeves), and a script that contains enough sci-fi mumbo jumbo to denounce any normal ritual. Bruce Willis stars in "Sin" and you know what that means. Aside from unloading a rifle, projecting his last shred of screen presence, and looking like Iron Man without full headgear, Brucie appears like he's in a coma with no chance of reverse stupor.Taking place in the year 2524 (that's random) and directed by Australian Edward Drake, Cosmic Sin is basically about Gen. James Ford (Bruce Willis) trying to stop a fleet of aliens that I guess look like humans. Willis doesn't do or say much but hey, he's Bruce "I used to be a beast" Willis. He probably got paid by the line (or any catatonic facial expression).Bottom line: Any way you cut it, I probably should've avoided watching Cosmic Sin. Its intentions are good considering but come on, it's more like "cosmic" debris (no pun intended for the late Frank Zappa). Forgive me for I have "sinned"."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11762434/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","2"," Were this a no budget film released on YouTube by some students for free I'd recommend it, but as a product by a professional studio with Bruce Willis in the lead it's trash. ","In the year 2524 an Earth colony has first contact with a hostile alien race. General Ryle (Frank Grillo) enlists disgraced "Blood General" James Ford (Bruce Willis) who was infamous for his use of a Q-Bomb that killed 70 Million people. Ryle enlists Ford to lead an off the books team to eliminate the alien threat before they're aloud to spread through the galaxy.Reteaming with Edward Drake and Corey Large of fellow DtV Willis sci-fi film Breach, Cosmic Sin looks and feels like it's from the same filmmakers to the point they almost feel like entries in their own "universe". Instead of aping Alien or The Thing like Breach, Cosmic Sin is more in line with sci-fi action like Aliens or Edge of Tomorrow. In a way I suppose Cosmic Sin is a marginal improvement on Breach, but in other ways with a larger scale story and a similar production budget, it feels noticeably cheaper than Breach as well.Much like Breach the movie doesn't feel like it takes place in the future. At least with Breach once they were on the ship they at least had proper uniforms that fit with the situation, but in Cosmic Sin everything feels like it's straight from today save for some CGI establishing shots of spaceships and some "armor"(we'll get to that). It's clear the movie's reach far exceeds it's grasp with the "high tech military facility" using the same tricks as breach to make it look futuristic with harsh multicolored lighting and poorly integrated hologram effects. But the filmmakers luckily decided to give us some locational variety with their shoot....the woods! All of the colony scenes (save for one scene with a tent) take place in the woods and have the same feeling of rushed and economic one would expect to see in a LARP straight out of Role Models. The armor the characters wear in the second half of the movie makes no sense as the script says it's approved for "quantum combat"(whatever that's supposed to be) and with open faced helmets and massive bare patches there's no thought or care as to how these cheap bulky monstrosities function in combat or space.Outside of the bare bones production values, the movie's script is a hodgepodge of pretty much every other sci-fi film/video game you've seen(and a few you haven't) with the likes of the 2009 Star Trek, Stargate, Edge of Tomorrow, Screamers, Gears of War, Aliens, and even Ghosts of Mars. The movie's script also tries to address "ethical issues" in quite possibly the most ill fitting approach since 2005's Stealth tried to analyze the moral issues of unmanned drone warfare. Willis' "Blood General" James Ford is so named because he quelled an separatist rebellion by dropping a Q-bomb killing 70 million people. The movie is strangely uncritical about this character with many of the supporting cast spouting things about how Ford got a "Raw Deal", "It's harder to give orders than follow them", "you need monsters to beat monsters", and it's the kind of mindset that many villains use for justification in many films of this ilk that makes the film feel fundamentally confused. Not that the story will draw most people in as it's poorly delivered with bad camera work, poorly staged sequences, and sleepy performances from uninterested actors with Bruce Willis' voice never even breaking an octave.Cosmic Sin continues Bruce Willis' disappointing DtV streak with an embarrassing cheap sci-fi rehash that is put to shame by amateurly made fan productions. With a sloppy production, cut and paste script, and uninterested performances that leave the movie inert and dull the movie will give you the odd laugh or smirk from point out its stolen ideas and concepts, but aside from that it's yet another cheap dud from a once respectable actor."

However its just not been done well enough and falls more than a little short in execution.The script needs an extensive rewrite, the production a competent director, and the cast or at least some of the major roles... recasting.There are zero laugh out loud moments and even though you hope there are going to be at least some humorous ones, they never materialize and instead your left with an expectant grimace on your face as you painfully watch the screenplay unfold.Unfortunately (it gets worse) there isn't even much of a underlying story here, so there isn't even an entertainment factor on the basic level.OK watch at your own risk, but there is nothing to see here.Do yourself a favor and give it a miss."

The movies has an interesting take on cryptocurrency and is ultimately supportive of it. There is documented evidence of the US government trying to control or influence Bitcoin so it is not far-fetched and the idea that worldwide adoption of cryptocurrency could weaken or destroy central banks is also not far-fetched. If you're into crypto and you have a sense of humour, you'll get this film. If you're some sort of crypto evangelist, maybe you won't get it.

I hope this helps the guy asking what drug they were using, don't mean to offend but it was the main premise of the film and if you missed that then you wasn't listening or watching the film properly so you probably shouldn't rate it in the first place, OK film think I'm just sick of the relentless low budget films released this year because of covid, they postponed a lot of films because of covid but in the 2 years since it all started there has been endless films based around covid or a ficticous virus, like they knew about trhe pandemic before it happened, most films take years of planning before filming yet a covid related film was released every few months on average during the pandemic????

What also amazed me was how much I felt for characters that I initially thought were really hateful individuals (thinking of Buck or George here).

She's in every scene and every moment and all the tension and suspense and story is built through her and she fully delivers. The concept needed a lead actress that could handle the role, and she excels. The time and space within the films framework gives her a chance to flesh the character out and build on it and she takes full advantage.The sinister undertone through-out feel even more biting and creepy through her performance and that really brings the film to life. Highly recommend it for fans of No Budget horrors but really it's a throughly decent film for any audience that enjoys these sort of genre pieces."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11771006/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Toucan dance? ","This is a gorgeous looking film, interspersed with a fine musical score and some beautifully artistic choreography. The plot centres around the rivalry of two girls vying for a place at the renowned Opra National in Paris. Guided by the inspirational "Mme. Brunelle" (Jacqueline Bisset) the two must face up to the challenges such dedication and focus engender. The problem here is that passion is seriously lacking. The plot is thin, but that would not matter so much if the pace and the sheer energy of the film were not so absent also. Neither Diana Silvers ("Kate") nor Kristine Froseth ("Marine") really leap (no pun intended) from the screen at us. Certainly we see a glimmer of the profound introspection the competition encourages - such acute focus on themselves, their skills, their self-belief - but that seems to have entirely supplanted any humanity from amongst not just them, but from the other dancers and though Bisset brings a certain class to the proceedings, the whole thing is just a bit too shallow and disengaging. In better hands, perhaps this could have been a more characterful study but as it is, it's very much an exercise in style over substance that though attractive is somewhat empty and maybe just a shade too self-indulgent."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11771006/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Cliche Wonderland ","The strongest part of Birds of Paradise is for sure the visual quality. Sadly, the story rides on every cliche regarding ballet I can think of (relationship drama, sex, drugs, total over the board resentment and competition, rich parents being emotional wrecks and evil entities, maestros with a notion to sadism, and I could go on and on). I just wondered the whole time when the girls (and boys) got time to do their study and training - remember, the setting is an elite dancer school. Also the questions between being an artist or following the rule of traditional classic dance is the wrong question - if I want to paint a piece in the style of Rembrandt I can't do action painting techniques - modern dance, classic dance, freestyle, whatever, it's up to you to chose the path you want to follow. I watched a few documentaries on the matter of elite ballet schools and groups and I did not get the impression that those dancers or teachers were maniacs, drug addicts and so on. Anyway, acting is good and the cinematography did hold my attention, was a real pleasure - last but not least, a better crafted and less stereotyped plot, and Birds of Paradise could have been a really good movie. Verdict: compared to Black Swan it is obvious that Birds of Paradise lacks of depth and originality story-wise. Exact rate: 5 + 1 bonus for the visuals only."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11771006/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","3"," No peak ","Storyline is super mediocre and nothing. 3some, enemy, drug in a ballet competition background. No remarkable and memorable point via the whole movie."

As in there are always the mean gals and the nice gals competing for a dance prize that only 1 gal and 1 boy can win , maybe the slight glimpses of the backgrounds of the main characters may differ from previous movies but essentially it is much the same!The only difference that I can see is nobody dies or is killed by the end so that I suppose is a slight twist . However not enough to make this movie stand out from the likes of Black swan and all the other generic ballet movies."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11771006/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","1"," Black Swan sequel 2.0 ","Why does IMDB keep deleting negative reviews of this film?Anyway, this was good when it starred Mila and Natalie. Why did they need to remake Black Swan?This was literally Black Swan no matter how you spin it. The lead was even cast because she looked like Natalie Portman. There were almost identical shots in this. Shame on Hollywood!! Shame on you! Time for some NEW ideas, please.Skip this!"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11771006/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","3"," Nothing happened ","The story of this movie does not exist, there are some moments of astonishment but nothing more.There is no story to follow, there is nothing to rely on to make a plot twist, turning them into moments of wonder, which cause curiosity and are the highlight of the script. There is never a development of each character, there are many characters that end up discarding and the end is left to interpretation. However, there are things to highlight such as the performances, especially that of Kristine Froseth, the choreography and the coordination are good.It's a shame that the talent of those involved is wasted by a script so lazy and boring that it says absolutely nothing."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11771006/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Not bad at all ","Considering the amount of fodder on Prime video, I was expecting mostly filler and there was a point where I asked myself what the movie was actually supposed to be about?And did it rise above that and finally mean anything? No, it didn't, but I watched it all the way through and kept on hoping for something bigger and deeper, which is all you can ask for, even though you don't necessarily get it.Beautiful people, not too cheesy, some pretty good acting, a few good songs and mostly great presentation. The film didn't try too hard and I liked it for its simplicity and eroticism and for not handing everything out on a plate.An entertaining watch that failed to hit major highs because the core story just isn't strong enough, but still classy and subtle enough to maintain a steady 7/10."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11771006/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","1"," A poor film without a beginning and an end ","I didn't have high expectations for this film as I already knew that streaming services are like the discount shelves of DVDs in the past. Those shelves were full of titles that weren't accepted to silverscreen or had done quite poorly. This one will not do any better than that.After half an hour I was so bored and angry that I had to stop watching and just out of curiosity I just continued to watch it on the next day. It's something remarkable that a film with great cast has one dimensional characters without background story, poor script and dialogue, doesn't engage and each scene is disconnected from each other. There's no climax, no beginning nor end and no idea what the film wants to say. It was said to be scarier than Black Swan and some kind of hybrid of Suspiria. Whoa, but the creators didn't have a slightest idea what they were doing.It's just a poorly executed drama which left me quite angry."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11771006/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," A Joy Ride ","This film was amazing. I knew it from the trailer as Kristine Froseth is a wonderful actress and so is her up and coming co-star Diana Silvers. Both very beautiful girls, although Kristine was a more belieavble ballerina due to her figure, height, grace etc. I enjoyed every moment...it's tense! Jacqueline Bisset gave a strong performance as usual and without saying too much, you can compare it to the masterpiece that was 'Black Swan' but on steroids. It is very seductive, beautiful cinematography and sometimes good choreography but most of all and surprisingly, the ending is unpredictable. Simply put the finale is perfect."

The score and production design help the experience so much and are effective. The storytelling is nuanced. The direction was on point. I really enjoyed the way the information was delivered.The tone was great. Sometimes I expected it to go some ways but it surprised me.Sometimes the movie moved between genres which I thought made the storytelling better and helped the experience. The performances were great too.The choreography was amazing. It was beautiful but it also was a big part of the storytelling and was meaningful and symbolic and poetic.It does what it wanted to do in an effective way imo.This is personal but the movie made me think about greatness in our society, and what it even means. Maybe there are more ways to interpret the word. I think with paying attention it is not hard to understand it during the first watch, but I also enjoyed the second watch a lot too."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11771006/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","2"," A student project with money ","Being a dancer growing up, I enjoy ballet movies if they are done somewhat descent.Unfortunately this is not one!At the beginning, as a movie nut I thought ok at least this is entertaining right? And that was pretty much the highlight of the movie the first time the main characters goes to the club.You can tell this is kinda low budget, not the worst low budget but you can tell more and more as the movie progresses. Characters are not developed, story plot is weak, and lots of bad acting.They want to be too many things- horror, drama, a little bit of sci-fi, a ballet movie... they got a tiny bit of everything but not enough of anything.It's unfortunate... it's best describe as a not funny version of Mean girls with tutu, sex and drugs(ok I might've just made it sound way better than it really is!)"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11771006/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Exceeded my expectations ","How much drama could there possibly be at a dance school? Sure, you have to practice your moves and navigate the egos of the other dancers, but how bad can it be? Well, as it turns out dance academy is fraught with about as much drama as a Saturday afternoon's worth of Come Dine with Me episodes.Kate was the best dancer at her school, back in her small hometown, no we're not talkin' body-popping or the foxtrot, we're talking ballet. Kate now finds herself far from home in Paris after earning a scholarship to a prestigious ballet academy, where she is suddenly a small fish in a very big pond. Every student there has one goal and one goal only, to be the best and win a contract with the Opera national de Paris. Kate soon strikes up a friendship with Marine, another American girl. Their relationship quickly becomes close, but can Kate really trust Marine, or is simply being manipulated so the coveted prize does not go to her?The first thing I have to say about Birds of Paradise is just what a good-looking film this is. First of all, the students are all beautiful, slim, and model-like. But beyond the actors dancing their hearts out the film itself is no slouch when it comes to aesthetics. The cinematography is as elegant and graceful as the ballet it is capturing and enhances many of the already impressive routines on display. In addition to this, the bird of paradise fable at the center of the story blends over into the real world, erupting in trippy dream-like sequences in which Kate and Marine come into their own and express themselves through dance in ways they never could. It should be stated that these are not dream sequences, but more an artistic representation of deep unspoken emotions.Birds of Paradise is about as French as a baguette wearing a beret, twiddling a wispy little mustache, and have casual liaisons behind his wife's back. That is to say, it's very French. A surprising portion of the dialogue is subtitled, with all the students, but Kate, at the academy able to speak it. Kate is a fish out of water and finds herself thrown in at the deep end. Those aquatic analogies clash a bit, but you get my point.Kate, played by Diana Silvers, has a firm moral center and strong connection with her equal morally virtuous father. Although the father in question is never seen, he has a strong presents throughout the film, thanks to the frequent phone calls he and Kate exchange.This is at least how she arrives at the school, but to earn the prize she finds herself constantly questioning her values and what she is willing to sacrifice to achieve greatness. Because of this Kate is a compelling character who is exposed to the reality of dancing at such a high level. The backstabbing, drugs, and bulimia, that run rife through the academy are illuminated to her and she is left in an almost impossible position. Dianna gives a compelling performance and her naivety upon her first arrival is believable, this makes it easy to root for the character when she goes up against the more experienced and cynical dancers.Marine is played by Kristine Froseth, who couldn't be more different from Kate. If Kate was a refreshing glass of Coke them Marine is mouth scorching shot of hot sauce. She's focused on the prize and wants to be the best no matter the cost and isn't afraid of making enemies. She's instantly unlikable, and seemingly a nasty little piece of work. However, throughout the film, her depth and true character are revealed resulting in a complex and emotionally rich character, who is compelling and easy to emphasize with. For me at least she was the star of the show, despite not being the protagonist, and her journey to find peace and equilibrium was the highlight of the film and a genuine surprise. Kristine gives an excellent emotionally rich performance that makes all these complex and difficult to execute ideas work seamlessly and effortlessly. This was my first exposure to the actress, but I look forward to seeing where she goes and what she does next.So, what's wrong with Birds of Paradise? Well, as far as I can tell not a whole lot. It's a compelling story with interesting characters and surprising character arcs. It doesn't talk down to the audience nor does it underline every point of the story. The fact is this is a story about two teenage girls competing to be the best dancer, and what they are willing to sacrifice to achieve that goal. It's not life or death and the fate of the world isn't at stake. The premise won't appeal to every demographic going and Birds of Paradise doesn't reach the highs of certain other ballet films that I won't mention here, but Birds of Paradise engaged me throughout and left me satisfied and surprised by the quality and richness of its characters.This intriguing balletic tale is worth seeking out and features excellent performances by some of the best up-and-coming young actors."

Or is it a dance to death?Watch on Amazon Prime and find out for yourself. Love every minute of this movie. (Did dance classes myself, dance is addictive). "

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11771006/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," Electric YA adaption of the genre ","Anger that's kept inside, raw emotions that pour into dance, romance, darkness, unbreakable bonds that break, enemies turned into friends turned into lovers turned into enemies and then friends again.. WOAH!I don't remember the last time I enjoyed an Indie film so much. Probably Joel Coen is right. Streaming is good as it lets such experimental films, that give birth to future starts, exist. They (Froseth and Silvers) were both phenomenal.My heart was pumping so fast during the entire movie. It was dark enough but at every minute I felt like it could turn from dark to scary to horrifying in a heartbeat. It's like waiting for a jump scare but way, way creepier. The music amplified every scene to an extreme. I didn't know what to expect at any moment. Will Marine betray Kate? Will Kate kill Marine? Will Marine commit suicide? Are they in love? Is Kate using Marine now? Would they ditch Felipe and dance as partners? Anything was possible. But more importantly.... The Story! It was magnificent. It's so rare that an arthouse/independent movie has a solid screenplay. It's about family, loss, friendship, sex, the roughness of first attraction, betrayal and redemption. You don't pay for perfection, you pay for romance.Froseth's Marine is probably one of the most emotionally mature characters I have ever seen in modern cinema. She was destined to become a prima donna and dance in Paris Opera but she chose the path that will make her - happy - rather than fulfill a destiny. I wonder how many of us would choose that. That's a phenomenal message to send to every young woman watching the film. She was insanely strong, she formed friendships, she showed vulnerability, she kept promises, she wasn't jealous. She had both genuine grace and raw boldness.Silvers's Kate is more of an i-have-got-this-one-chance-at-life character. Usually, in life as well, the one that has nothing to go back to is more prone to betrayal. The film does a great job depicting that dark turn. She forms a friendship and just when she feels a genuine connection everyone starts pointing out that her new friend just uses her, so she tries to get the upper hand. Ultimately, she chooses becoming M, rather than being with M. Kate's worries turn into paranoia as she starts to falsely believe that she (Kate) is the better one out of them but M will still get ahead with the help of family money. At that point she commits a bitter betrayal which changes the trajectory of the film. However, M's response to betrayal is smth out of this world. She doesn't get angry or vengeful. M (Marine) continues to root for Kate and just goes her separate path.Birds of Paradise is a quentessential picture about female rivalry, friendship and attraction. You can compare it with Suspiria and Black Swan. But trust me, it has a lot of its own going on to be different enough. People are speculating whether this is a tale of friendship or romance between the female leads. I would go with friendship. However, labeling relationships is wrong imho. As weird as this may sound but two females can have sex and still be friends and nothing more. Human relationships don't have to be structural and binary. We feel what we feel. Has it been a more queer version of the Black Swan, I believe it would have become more popular but this way, it's more neccessary. And it fills the right holes.The movie undoubtedly has its shortcoming. In particular, the transitions from strangers to enemies to friends is not smooth at all. It all happens to fast and takes to little. But for the 1.5h runtime, you couldn't hope for more.The movie also has the most exciting and suffocating sex scene I have seen since Eyes Wide Shut. You don't actually see any sex happening but the glances, the music, the touches - you call feel it all."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11771006/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," A dance movie antidote to Cancel Culture ","I love movies, I love dance and I have an English Literature degree so I know a compelling story when I see one. The beauty is that you never Really know if M is sincere or not, until the end. You also don't know what will happen next, or why. Who is the villain and who is heroine?The backstory of M and her twin brother added a richer texture to the entire film, especially for me since I have boy/girl twins and I know the special bond twins have.We don't know if the rumor about M and her brother is true and it makes the rich girl M seem more human and relatable.I enjoy the fact that the story is not a trite or generic class struggle story, so common in dance movies (Flashdance, Dirty Dancing, Center Stage, Save the Last Dance etc).I never felt the sexuality was gratuitous or even disrespectful towards the young actresses (and I'm a modest person). It all seemed fitting and realistic as dance is an art that is sensual and can often leads to sexual activity that is more related to expression and power.What stands out most is that both leads fall and make huge mistakes but then redeem themselves and show grace to eachother.In these times of condemnation, snap judgements and canceling, this is a movie every young woman should watch."

","This movie starts out promising, but from "save the last dance" to "black swan", it will remind you of all those scenes, some so alike it's not even funny. The cast is bland, the acting is bland, there are no great dance scenes as they are almost poorly filmed or cut. The end kinda saves it, and so does the contrived friendship between the two main portagonists, but that's about it. Watchable."

Otherwise, it's an uninteresting film of a shaky cameraman walking around behind a boring average teen with most of the story left to be assumed than acted out.

Would have loved to see Jenny and Caleb's relationship a bit more, the end definitely left me wanting more so it would have been interesting to see what happens with those two. Definitely excited to see what new movies this studio produces. You got a fan!"

The symphonic crescendo of Maurice Ravel's "Bolero" is perfectly synched with this film's crescendo, creating a heart-racing, frantic few moments of passion, lust, revelation, and shock - for both the characters and viewers. Also shocking is discovering that this is writer-director Gabriele Fabbro's first feature length narrative film (after many shorts and videos). This is expert filmmaking and creative storytelling in a time when it's certainly needed and appreciated.Veteran Italian actor Lidia Vitale stars as Roxanne. The film opens on her haggard face as she utters, "F-you". Right on cue, the organ music thunders over the opening credits. Her bitterness is aimed at the banner hanging outside the church where she works. The words on the banner dare state, "Everything will be fine". This is March 2020, and Italy has just begun the initial shutdown over COVID-19.Roxanne is a passionate restorer of pipe organs, and this 1700 church currently houses two - one from 1500 and one from 1900. After a workplace tragedy, Roxanne's supervisor, Paolo (Marcello Mariani), finds her an assistant who will work for organ-playing lessons and food. Lucia (Ludovica Mancini) is a young, eager-to-learn mute. Her soft, soulful eyes are in stark contrast to Roxanne's sharp facial features and stone cold glares of loathing. Whereas Roxanne is angry, annoyed, and hot-tempered, Lucia remains spirited, open, and energetic.Of course, the barriers between the two slowly break down, but the twists and surprises and secrets are gradually unveiled. Roxanne's obsessions are not limited to the beautiful pipe organs and sweet Lucia has a side to her no one would have predicted. Ms. Vitale's performance really drives the story and the building of trust between Roxanne and Lucia. The manner in which conveys the softening of her barriers and the re-directing of her focus is fascinating.Without being overbearing, the film reminds us of the pandemic through Paolo's all too frequent ringing of the 'death bell', the television reports playing in the background, the protective mask defiantly looped around Roxanne's ear, and the warning that nature may carry out God's wrath. And speaking of nature, the camera work outside the church is, at times, stunning in its beauty, striking angles, and message. It's rare to find a filmmaker's 'first' feature so original and well-executed, and that is on top of Mr. Fabbro's use of powerful pipe organ music throughout. This is a truly fine film that hopefully will find an audience."

A foundational classic for changing Courtroom Drama Genre. ","Naandhi (2021) : Brief Review -Finally, Indian Cinema has something as an answer to Hollywood Masterpiece 'In The Name Of The Father'. A foundational classic for changing Courtroom Drama Genre. I am not sure whether everyone here have seen Hollywood Masterpiece 'In The Name Of The Father' which was based on a true story. An Innocent guy is framed for the crime which he did not commit and then his entire life becomes hell and empty. Years after, he gets a chance to fight and then justice is delivered. The film ends with the release of all those innocent guys. Naandhi has similar plot led by a single innocent young boy but it's very much fictional. Though, it uses corruption factor very strongly against the politicians and the law system. It does not end with his release but it takes the fight to next level as the guy files a case against the Police officer who framed him to seek judicially approved revenge. So, in short it's not just an answer to the Hollywood Masterpiece but also a great follow-up. The film will leave you in pain many times, it will make your heart cry but later it also shows the powerful fight back against the tormented injustice. It goes unnecessarily dramatic in the climax just to please mainstream cinelovers so definitely it hurts a little hence, i have deducted 1 point from the final rating. Rest, no complaints at all. Allari Naresh's performance is award worthy and Varalaxmi Sarathkumar is excellent too. Rest of the cast is immensely supportive. The film has good dialogues and some are just outstanding, there's like 5-6 powerful ones to hit you hard. A big shout out to director Vijay Kanakamedala who has delivered a powerful and socially important Classic on his debut. Overall, a MUST WATCH! I can't wait for the remakes now.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest."

I deeply admired the nobility of the themes and drama they were aiming for with this film, and I'm going to lookout for Vijay Kanakamedala's future endeavours. Naresh's acting, and the beautiful long take, man, the moment I left the film, the feelings and emotions were lingering the whole day. Hats-off!!! A really good piece of cinema.

But this subject has more potential if director has been deal in more sensible and humanistic way instead of portraying in over violent manner.

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11773456/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Great Concept! 7/10 ","Allari Naresh gets through a transformation. Allari Naresh has not gotten a box office hit since 2012 and this movie is the perfect way to start his 2nd innings.The concept is very new. Never before in TFI was a film solely based around what happens to people that get convicted wrongly and section 211.The first 20 minutes builds curiosity as to what happened in Allari Naresh's past and is a great way to start a story like this. The camera angles here are quite unique. Coming to the Flashback it is the perfect flashback that we are expecting from the amount of curiosity that is built at the start. (flashback is violent and may not appeal to family audience)The story shifts to Naresh going out of Jail; but a new section 211 case is filed. This is where the BIGGEST flaw of the movie lies. The mistake here, is the transition between the 2 court cases. It feels like 2 movies are being congested into one movie.Ignoring that part if we go to the 2nd half it is definitely interesting but not as good as the first half. The screenplay in the 2nd half is very weird and flows unevenly. The story gets more saturated as the twists get revealed. But the climax is extrordinary just becasue of Allari Naresh' mindblowing acting.I would've rated the movie much higher if the transition would've been cleaner but since that is also part of the film I will give it a 7.0/10 (A very good movie) due to the new concept.Screenplay and Execution: 2.50/5.00Scale to compare:9.0/10 Mahanati, 8.0/10 Bahubali 2, 7.0/10 NAANDHI, 6.0/10 Uppena, 5.0/10 Saaho, 4.0/10 Agnyathavasi."

Every department worked well in this movie and biggest advantage is no cliche scenes ( maybe Naresh portion with family and love for 10 mins might look silly ) but it's should be there for plot settlement ..

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11773456/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," A pathbreaking Telugu film of recent times ","Naandhi is definitely a path breaking Telugu film of the recent times with an off beat subject that was cleanly canned. The no nonsense story telling and editing is the way to go for the younger film makers like Vijay Kanakamedala. Its not a joke to select this subject something like this and pull audience to the theaters during pandemic fears. This is probably Naresh's best performance after his out of the box role in Maharshi. In addition to this support role by Varalakshmi is flabbergasting followed by Priyadarshi and Praveen. I will be too surprised if Naresh does not bag a National award for his mind blowing performance in this flick. This film must be chosen for this years Oscar entries from India. Heart touching emotional saga, mind bending twists in the court room drama are pleasure to watch (you may recollect some old 70s/80s court scene based movies here :) ).In brief Nandhi is really a nandhi for social subjects based movies of the recent times that was told in very entertaining and gripping manner ,though some short falls with couple of mis-direction bloopers. Go for it, and make this movie as your "nandhi" of watching a film in theater post lock down, if you haven't done yet."

And the small roles eiza did: jetta in jem and the holograms, darling in baby driver, carlala in welcome to marwen, nyssiana in alita: battle angel, madam M in Hobbs & Shaw & maia Simmons in Godzilla vs. Kong, don't get me wrong they're wonderful & love it that eiza gave it all she got. But still those "cameo/special guest star" roles did NOT do law & order for & eiza & those characters!!! & were not enough to fully show her talents/gifts! Cause what I saw in her show, from dusk till dawn: the series, her recent movies: paradise hills, she's missing, bloodshot, cut throat city, I care alot & now in love spreads,... Eiza deserves Oscars!!!Anyway, (clearing throat), I just finished watching love spreads few minutes ago, it was SPECTACULAR!!! The directing, cinematography, the story & plotline, the cast & crew. Etc. It was wonderful. But my most favorite is eiza & her character Patricia. Even though they enter halfway, still. Eiza truly shined, owned and dominated the whole movie, the second she enters the scene. Seriously, they were the main drive of the whole movie & the band (glass heart) love patricia's positivity, big hearted attitude & beautiful energy. Also loved that eiza ended the movie, literally, riding out to a new journey/adventure with her band & having fun along the way. LOVE IT!!! Love spreads is one of the best movies I've ever seen. Again, one of eiza gonzalez's great performances. She truly outdid herself, once again. I give love spreads 9/10. And for eiza & her character Patricia (another new favorite of eiza's I love) I give them 100!I highly recommend y'all this movie."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11777510/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," Better than most this season ","There's been a lot of negativity around this movie but it's honestly a joy. Using the British-honed style of faux documentary filmmaking, it follows a girl band Glass Heart as they work on their album at the famous Rockfield Studios in England. Their manager Mark (Nick Helm) is struggling to get Kelly (Shawkat), a pretentious and uppity American and the songwriter of the band, to crack on so they can get recording, the label breathing down his neck. Meanwhile, the band is flailing in all directions -- until the brilliant and flamboyant studio guitarist Pat (Gonzalez) arrives. I wonder if Americans will get this style of filmmaking, and that might be part of the problem, but if this had been a show like Fleabag instead of a movie, I think it would have won countless awards and would have made it majestically across the pond.Alia Shawkat is great at being disgusting here, and is a fantastic stick in the mud for Nick Helm, also turning in a fantastic performance. Chanel Cresswell is the balance for all, a believable ballast for the band. Of course, Eiza Gonzalez takes the movie away, and is addictive watching for the second half, every little eye movement and hair flick perfectly engineered for this character, moved only by Nick's grounded wife, a brilliant cameo by Dolly Wells.This is a great film, and much better than half the movies being touted as masterpieces this season. And it's a feminist piece, no gross sex scenes, breasts out, none of that. Just a properly made story and properly thought out acting."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11777738/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," Underdeveloped! ","By far, the weakest work by Farhadi. Seems like he's made "Fetishization of Ethics" a trademark of his works, which is super lame tbh. If I wanted to hear a sermon, I would have attended the Friday prayers with legit preachers ordained to do the job. Also, Jadidi's performance was mediocre, to say the least, and did not deserve the praise and hype at all."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11777738/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," Watched at TIFF - Incredible performances all around, Jadidi steals the show! ","It's not Farhadi's best but I very much enjoyed this film! Amir Jadidi absolutely steals the show and puts in probably his greatest performance to date. Just watch how his acting from the first half of the film shifts drastically in the last hour - he shows incredible range and makes a name for himself here.In terms of the story, Farhadi once again throws you directly into the characters' lives and provides an interesting take on social media's greatest and most disturbing influences. It's not as entertaining as A Separation or The Salesman but I enjoyed A hero for what it is. It's a social discussion on the lengths one would go to keep their honour and reputation despite financial challenges.This had one of the best cinematography I've seen from all Farhadi's films, I recommend people to watch this expecting a slow and much darker story then his previous features."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11777738/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," Farhadi's best since A separation ","When we discuss on movies by Asghar Farahdi we do expect to see some character swings in the screenplay and this is not an exceptional movie in this respect. However, we encounter with a more experienced director which has now become more skilled in using this technique as the other aspects of the characters result in making these swings more believable. This is exactly what he lacked in previous movies of himself except some parts in A Separation andA Beautiful City. This movie has it all; from romance to comedy; comedy to drama, drama to tragedy. The same with his previous movies, we see so many symbols available in the movie. The city of Pars, Shiraz may trigger the ancient Iranian culture of less lies and more love which has been surrounded by darkness of the social network and probably the current era difficulties which makes this movie a critical one while illustrating all we could have already heard in theory regarding bad impacts of social media on people lives. Farhadi is now capable of designing his path to the main message he has there in his mind. He speaks frankly with less metaphors compared to his previous movies and we do understand what his challenges are with the morality issues existing not only in Shiraz, Iran but also in the today's world. Characters in the movie are neither bad nor good; they are all humans and are free to challenge themselves with the lives' difficulties. Farhadi wants to anecdote his story in a way that let us think how our decisions and somehow acts might be praised or criticized by the society; the same with all heroes since the very beginning of this world who had enemies and friends, people with and people against themselves at the same time.I believe this has been one of the most geometrical original screenplays ever written. It would be wonderful not to see this among the final Oscars contenders; it has it all.Farhadi also has another time convinced the cinema fans that he is a director to remember. I can not avoid mentioning the performance of Amir Jadidi among the best ones in 2021. His Shirazi accent, the way he talks to us through his eyes and the way he pictures what he has thoroughly understood from his role in the movie. It would be hard to avoid Farhadi's ability in directing his play and if you add the other cast performances including the newcomer Sahar Goldoust as Farkhonde and Mohsen Tanabandeh as the debtor, we see excellent performances by the cast thank to their own capability and a good way of directing by Farhadi. All the other aspects also prove my word as we can experience the exact timing for original score to play, the exact angles for the cameras and the exact colors for the scene which makes Farhadi's performance a one to remember, a one to praise.I believe this movie is one of the best movies in the world of cinema and I recommend this to be watched by anyone who would like to learn something through joy of cinema.It is obviously Farhadi's best since A separation and is a certain contender for the Academy Awards this year.Amin Ghanbari- 30 October 2021."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11777738/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," A Hero Of Cards ","This film beautifully represents contradiction & conflict in society & people's mind. The people that counting on a prisoner man, trust him & call him a hero, After a while drop him down as a dishonest & a liar.The whole characters in the story are unstable & shaky. Furthermore, we understand that circumstances & situations forced them to act in different conditions.After all, The film is well played by fluent actors and actresses. The plot is attractive, breathtaking, at the same time encourage the audience to follow every single scenes of the film.."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11777738/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," I very much hope that this film will win an Oscar ","Farhadi is a good storyteller, sometimes I imagine what would have happened if he had gone to write a novel instead of directing cinema. Can he create compelling novels like his films or does he know storytelling with pictures? I do not know the answer to this question yet, but I know one thing very well that his screenplays are exciting stories that can easily exist in each of our lives.The movie Hero starts straight and goes on. The story is not complicated and everything seems safe and secure. The spectator, however, is constantly waiting for a knot to enter the story and shake the earth and time. The hero goes like a good life, which suddenly begins to disintegrate with a small knot, and when the first domino falls, the rest of the dominoes fall. A story is like a food that no matter how much it is stirred, nothing can be done to make it better.Amir Jadidi leaves a completely different role in this film than all the films we have seen from him so far. The "hero" of Farhadi's film is a slice of the life of a superhero who has neither a cape nor a mask and blindfold. The superhero of his film is a simple man who eats the stick of his simplicity; People around him play with him and he does not know how to play a role in this dirty game. This superhero gets out of the way of life and returns to the right path with the words of his enemy, when he expresses his anger. There is no white or black here and everyone is gray and they are all lying."

The first one is for Iranians who consider a familiar system that creates puzzles and turns ethics into dilemmas. For such an understanding, familiarity with the culture is crucial. On the other hand, non-Iranians as always are faced with ethical twists with a taste of exoticism, which is still acceptable and of course leads to a wider international audience."

He then chooses to use his fame to normalize the backward regime in his country and to whitewash the mass murders of his fellow citizens by the ruling dictatorship.Since the protagonist is a coward (this can be inferred from the weakness of his voice as he speaks), he tries to justify his apathy and indifference towards others by saying that he, as an artist, does not and should not get involved in political matters directly. Yet, the movie reminds the viewer how the protagonist has used the public platforms and events to the benefit of the Iranian regime before, for example by reading statements against US policies and joining events in favor of people in Gaza and Palestine.All in all, "A Hero" is another intelligent work from the established director, Rahim... I mean, Asghar Farhadi. My main problem was with the shaky camerawork, which is the reason I am giving this movie a lower rating."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11777738/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," Back to real Farhadi ","By watching this movie I felt again a breathtaking farhadian world. All the performances were great, especially Amir Jadidi that showed his greatest work in this picture. I liked also the appropriate inner rythme which had a good contre-point with the editing.The main subject was very engaging. When I was watching it, I could feel every moment of film with all my heart. Moreover, I have found it's soundtrack very amazing. Even though it was not highlighted in the movie, it created a great Iranian vibe in some moments of film.Finally, I think you won't be regretful to watch this movie."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11777738/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," Well, ","At the moment this review is posted the IMDB rating of "A Hero" is 5.3. The movie has not been released yet so the chances that the people who are bombarding the movie with 1 star reviews were in Cannes or in another of a handful of festivals that it was screened and they really hated this film are very slim. I'm not sure what's the agenda behind this attempt for defamation of the film but my guess would be that they come from people who would like Farhadi to be more vocal and criticize more the Iranian state. But Farhadi let's his films speak for their own.And what a powerful voice they have indeed. From a technical point the film is excellent as someone should expect from him at this point. The acting is excellent, the photography purposeful but in a good way, and the rhythm is great. As for the script is really a masterclass, that people who like cinema I'm pretty sure they're gonna appreciate.Don't fool yourself, this film may be subtle but it is deeply political. It's just that most good films don't have to rub their morality or political opinion in your face. Don't get me wrong, it is not a very morally or politically complicated film. In fact as the director himself said in a recorded message for the festival this film is about a very simple man. But the way he treats his characters is not simple in the mean that they are not exaggerated in order to form archetypes, and therefore they seem rather human that certainly adds a very realistic element to the film. That's the reason I found it to be a very heavy film in a way.All in all, I think it's an excellent film who is going to age pretty well and I expect as soon as it is released the rating to skyrocket pretty fast."
