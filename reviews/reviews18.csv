","I'm not quite sure what I was expecting - but this rather meandering drama left me leaving the cinema asking what or whom this film was for? Oscar Isaac ("William Tell") is a gambler - a successful, under the radar kind of fellow - with a military past steeped in trauma. He encounters a young man "Cirk" (Tye Sheridan) with whom he has something in common - both men have suffered at the hands of his former CO "Gordo" (Willem Dafoe). The older man, wishes to temper the anger and lust for revenge of the younger, and takes him under his wing. Except, well, he doesn't really. He takes him on tours of the poker games, shares his winnings, introduces him to his fixer "La Linda" (Tiffany Haddish). That, though, is all he seems to be offering the young man - a shell upon which he can become a bored, barnacle!. That's when I found myself looking at my watch. Towards the end, the plot takes a swing for left field that is not only sad, but also a precursor to an ending that is frankly really quite poor. The dialogue is strained, and though Haddish easily wins on the star front here, the rest of the cast sort of loll around in a soporific haze of emotional baggage that really is quite dreary to watch. Maybe I just wasn't in the mood, but looking around me in the cinema - plenty of other people seemed to wondering why they hadn't gone to see "Spencer" too..."

With much of the setting at the casino and poker table, there's no table talk and only one hand shown and it's a silly one with an A2 and 7's calling on an 899 board. Also the same players getting to the end isn't reality, as playing perfect doesn't guarantee anything, cards still have to run out. The characters and performances beside Isaac are bad and he isn't great either. The music throughout awful as well, but most of all nothing happens and what does is just weird."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11196036/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt"," One of the best films and performances of the year. Schrader and Isaac at their best. ",""I never imagined myself as someone suited to incarceration." William Tell (Oscar Isaac)Having written Taxi Driver and directed First reformed, Paul Schrader knows something about deeply-troubled souls, especially haunted taxi drivers and small-town cops. Now add card counting loner.In The Card Counter, former army interrogator Bill has turned card champion while relishing his 8 years in Fort Leavenworth for, it would seem, brutality at Abu Ghraib as a grunt guard. "Relished" because of the control prison afforded him, where he learned his card-playing trade. Nothing has helped him, however, to expiate his sins and redeem himself until he meets young Cirk (Tye Sheridan) and La Linda (Tiffany Haddish).Experience the most accomplished cinematic anti-hero of the year-Bill roams the landscape of mid-west casinos, forgettable and banal, peopled by losers and wannabes looking for a romantic hit, even as the house controls their fortunes like a wizard pulling the strings of fate and laughing at his victims' impotence. Except for always-in-control Bill, whose days of interrogation control, taught to him by a sadistic major Gordo (mustachioed Willem Dafoe, inscrutably eccentric and scary), and who bets small and wins small to avoid being ejected for what he is, an accomplished card counter haunted by the ghosts of his tortured and torturing past.The exposition is slow, more distributed than immediate disclosure. This pace lets the audience sink into Bill's world of gambling and isolation as he reveals in voiceover his thoughts about the lives he ruined and the officers like the major who escaped punishment. While Isaac steadily plays Bill with a smoldering intensity, the future begins to loom large while he and Cirk plan a reconciliation for Cirk and his mother, a consummation with La Linda, and a Dantean end for the major. In the first lies the seeds of Bill's redemption while in the last lies the revengeful legacy of an Abu Ghraib that just won't go away.Shrader's shots are either long, to establish the emptiness of the casinos, or rapidly roaming to heighten the horror of scary Abu Ghraib, frequently tracking the anti-hero in his measured quest to control and win. As a knight errant, he meets his lady in La Linda, whose place in this man's world as a master of a stable of players is never fully realized, so obsessed is Schrader with his saturnine sociopath. In that regard, Isaac gives one of the year's most nuanced performances in the tradition of the lost but deadly Travis Bickel in Taxi Driver. Isaac is one of his generation's best actors, like Tom Hardy, whom you might forget except for the memorable characters he plays like William Tell. And Schrader does tell as powerfully as he ever did.Just don't expect to learn how to play better poker, for The Card Counter is all about people-if you're good at the game, it's because you can look past the cards into the soul of your opponent. Paul Schrader is just such a soul-searching writer/director. BTW-Martin Scorsese is a producer and presents the opening title card--no surprise there."

The story follows William(in a good performance from Oscar Isaac) as an ex military interrogator who after his prison release puts one of his learned skills and vices to good use. That happens to be he now travels as a poker and card player competing in world series games all around the country. However his life is still haunted by past memories and his old military boss Gordo(the great Willem Dafoe) plays a part and a connection and a return to a downfall is meant for William. Along the way William has a sidekick and partner in La Linda(the sexy Tiffany Haddish and I loved the scene in which she sports that sexy black bra in bed with Oscar!) a sexy and professional street smart gal who provided some sexy eye candy scenes, and she even bonded and gets intimate between the sheets with William as she guides his winning table ways.

Only one aspect can be set in the limelight, very nice filmographical presentation, but thats it...acting is not bad but boring, story and plot is daft and slow, and if you pay the ticket to become a better pokerplayer, then the book ''poker for dummies '' will teach you more.Im a grumpy old man with a whole lot of time to spend, therefore im not angry about such foolplay of a movie and it doesnt hurt, but if you measure your life in money per hour, then save yourself from this one."

His mistakes from the past haunt him and he tries to find redemption and salvation from his present actions.I liked this movie because it had a nice and interesting plot consisted of mystery and drama. The interpretation of Oscar Isaac who played as William Tell was very good and he made the difference. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Tye Sheridan's who played as Cirk, Tiffany Haddish's who played as La Linda and Willem Dafoe's who played as Gordo. The direction which was made by Paul Schrader who is also the writer of it, it was very good and he presented his main character with very few information something that created a mystery behind him while he mainly focused on his present life. To sum up, I have to say that "The Card Counter" is an interesting movie with a simple plot that I am sure you will be interested on watching so, I recommend you to watch it."

","This was the absolute worst film I have ever seen. Anything above a 2/10 is being very generous. This film was pointless, annoying and cringeworthy. The only thing close to any suspense is the less than 5 minutes Dafoe spends with Isaac, and even that was lame.I don't know what type of recreational pharmaceuticals seasoned writer and director Paul Schrader was on, but they were a buzz-kill. This film should be a course-study example in every film school in the world, starting at the 5th grade drama classes, on what NOT to do as a filmmaker.Schrader successfully managed to un-direct a film into a blended mess of convoluted cringeworthy nonsense. Was he even present to direct his cast properly? Aside from a few dramatic outbursts, Isaac, Sheridan and Haddish (although I did see a few characteristic smiles from her) gave the absolute stale, monotonic and expressionless performances I have ever seen in my life. Thankfully Dafoe had little screen time to join that club.The writing felt like 3-4 different screenplays were thrown into a Ninja blender and taped together at random. You'll constantly be waiting and hoping that a switch will flip, and this train-wreck of a ride will amount to some type of reward. You will be disappointed. The story was convoluted, incoherent, pointless, and like Texas Hold-em, lots of flops. At best, as a character study, all I really enjoyed was the poker faces at the final table with Mr. USA. For educational purposes, the real character study were the stale, monotonic and expressionless characters and performances, and the writer and director who guided them all there.The scenes were overly dragged out and mostly unnecessary. I could cut 80% from this film, and it may be somewhat entertaining and coherent. The pacing was, well... read my review heading. Even the score was annoying, overbearing and unfitting - to the point it'd be better suited in a horror film.If you really hate someone, tell them to watch this, be patient until the very end, because the reward will be worth it. They will never speak to you again."

Let's not forget Paul Schrader wrote the brilliant "Taxi Driver", which Martin Scorsese directed. Now both Scorsese and Schrader are back together again, but did they create fireworks again? Not exactly. This movie is firstmost a character portrait of Oscar Isaac, a hustler at gambling, with a very shady past and HIS PAST comes back to haunt him. Unfortunately the execution of this story is simply not a directional gem. Not bad, but certainly not terrific either...The good: the acting is great. The suspense is good. The terror is haunting. I just kept guessing where this story would go. And THAT's the real charm of this movie: an INTRIGUEING plot, with excellent acting performances.This director Paul Schrader is bound to confuse and divide audiences.

I hoped that wouldn't be the case with 'The Card Counter' but it absolutely was. This movie was a bit of a mess.There are a lot of scenes where the lead character narrates different casino games and explains how best to win them. There is the odd interesting one like the card counting explanation, however most of them are embarrassing to listen to when you know a thing or two about casino games. They are both over-dramatised and over-simplified at the same time.The film itself is just bizarre. Characters find connections without the film doing anything to sell them to us. We are just supposed to accept them. It's really odd. Also for a large portion of the film we have no idea what the point is. Things just kind of drift along and you wonder why you are even watching this. Then at the end it tries to make up for all that lost time, but again it is just so out of place, unearned and unusual that it has no effect on you at all.I wanted to like this film, I really did. The premise sounded so good in the synopsis. I assure you though, the promise of "cinematic intensity" is not lived up to for one minute. This is one of the least intense films I've ever witnessed. I'll generously give this a 5/10. Not one I'd recommend."

Oscar was a military interrogator working under-and trained by-Willem during the Guantanamo Bay years. Oscar went to prison and Willem got off free and went on book tours. Oscar learned how to count cards while he was in prison and becomes a gambler when he gets out, winning small amounts in different casinos, not raising any alarms-the House doesn't like big winners.

Once out of prison, he is living a lonely life on the road as a gambler who is traveling from one casino to another. He grows closer to an acquaintance from the gambling world named La Linda who is escaping from her own violent past and planning on finding a sponsor for the talented gambler. William Tell meets a young drifter named Cirk Baufort who is in a negative state of mind after years of mental and physical abuse from his father who eventually committed suicide. The trio starts traveling together but just as the three loners feel like they have finally found purpose in life, tragedy puts their relationships to the test.The Card Counter convinces on several levels. First of all, the three lead characters are intriguing and have much depth. Their background stories share violent similarities but also distinct differences that make each character charismatic and unique. The relationship between these characters is constantly shifting and changing from start to finish.The movie also has a gripping sinister undertone. This atmosphere is provided by repetitive locations such as anonymous motels, boring highways and soulless casino alleys. It's further supported by dimmed light effects. The moody soundtrack plays in appropriately as well.The film's final thirty minutes are certainly the highlight as things spin out of control. These scenes will keep you on the edge of your seat and keep viewers guessing how things are going to unfold until the final scene that is both beautiful and tragic.On the other side, the movie also has several downsides. Its pace is very slow which makes it difficult to get into the film in the first place and keep watching it until the rewarding finale.The actions and dialogues are as repetitive as the atmosphere and locations. The film shows several overlong gambling segments and the conversations revolve around haunting pasts colliding with potentially brighter futures.Despite its downsides, The Card Counter has grown on me and is worth a try if you like slow-paced dramas with a violent twist carried by profound characters. The movie needs some time to get started and certainly has several lengths but all those things pay off in the final thirty minutes of this charismatic crime drama."

","Paul Schrader's (Affliction/First Reformed) latest which stars Oscar Isaac, Tiffany Haddish & Tye Sheridan. Taking place in the world of gambling, Isaac, a former military man who worked in black ops sites where intense interrogations took place, makes his way in life making money as a consummate card counter (even though he's pretty good in other games of chance) but when 3 people come into his orbit, his life is thrown a-kilter. Haddish, a bankroll who he's known from before, offers her financial services to make a play for a foreign shark currently 'killing it' on the poker circuit, Sheridan, a young man who claims his father served along side him in Abu Ghraib befriends him & Willem Dafoe, his commander from his torture times, just happens to be giving a lecture about security at one of the gambling venues. Isaac served time for his past bad deeds (seen in flashbacks) & as we see him dictating his thoughts in notebooks (shades of Dafoe's character in Schrader's Lightsleeper), he's on a razor's edge of keeping his wits about him. Isaac takes Sheridan on the road w/him & as their relationship grows, Sheridan admits he's on a mission to kill Dafoe (his father was incarcerated as well for his war crimes) which he fails as Dafoe kills him in an off screen break-in at his home. Hearing the news, Isaac decides to finish the job, damn the consequences, even though he's developed an amorous new turn w/Haddish. Being the kind of film Schrader has pretty much perfected in his 40 plus career, you can't fault him too much for going back to the same well again & again (he loves that ending from Bresson's Pickpocket!) but here it seems he had 2 separate ideas, the gambling angle & the revenge narrative, which he thought he could merge together but unfortunately the union is a divisive one which never gels together & even his handling of the gambling aspect almost feels half-hearted as we never engage w/Isaac's predicament. Nice to see him doing what he does best but Schrader owes it to himself to do better."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11196036/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt"," A journey to the darkside ","When we first meet William Tell (Oscar Isaac) we learn that he's an ex-con who spent his time in the slammer learning how to count cards. Tell prowls mostly low rent casinos and plies his trade, ever careful not to draw too much attention to his mathematical edge. He wins most of the time, but never "too much".When he meets a young man along his travels, Cirk (Tye Sheridan), we also learn that Tell and Cirk's dad are ex-military, and who participated in some of the armed forces' darkest dealings in the war on terror under the command of Major Gordo (Willem Dafoe). Feeling a kinship, Tell takes Cirk under his wing. Tell also encounters another card shark, La Linda (Tiffany Haddish), who proposes to him that he joins her in becoming a hired player for some big money guys who will bankroll his playing - for a large cut, but, of course.Writer-Director Paul Schrader is no stranger to seamy underbelly of society (TAXI DRIVER, HARDCORE). The card tables, bars and hotels and motels are a natural backdrop for his characters and Schrader presents them in all their dank glory - rarely showing much sunlight. One can almost smell the liquor and inhale the smoke abetted by Alexander Dynan's cinematography and a highly atmospheric score by Robert Levon Been and Giancarlo Vulcano. THE CARD COUNTER is also road picture of sorts. The main trio travel from city to city earning money along the way, one grimy dollar at a time.All throughout his career going back to his first screenplay, THE YAKUZA (co-written with his brother Leonard and Robert Towne), Schrader has been fascinated with characters who are in pursuit of some kind of inner personal journey. His last movie, FIRST REFORMED, centered on a minister (Ethan Hawke) who's despair with the world around him leads him on an individual quest to right its wrongs. Tell's backstory also haunts, and the mostly individual act of blackjack and poker playing feeds his obsessions up to a point.The movie never glamorizes their pursuit, and it also doesn't flinch from showing Tell's flashbacks to his time in war (fair warning). And, for much of the picture that suffices buoyed by Isaacs' strong if purposely underplayed performance. It's therefore surprising that when the picture reaches its climax it's curiously unmoving. It's extremely well-directed, suits the character and the story, yet feels unsatisfying. It's an example of ending which may work on the printed page, but, still feels undernourished when presented on screen.THE CARD COUNTER is certainly a strong reflection of Schrader as a filmmaker. It's well done and acted, if a bit too personal a vision to be entirely transmissible to the cinema. It's what makes Schrader's films so compelling to watch, even if one sometimes feels like they are being left outside."

This one was also executively produced by Martin Scorsese, so naturally I had high hope for this movie.This gotta be one of the weirdest movie that I have watched. For the first hour and 15 minutes, I was very confused about what was going on. The pacing was slow and pensive with Oscar Isaac character going between casinos. There were large amounts of crash courses on blackjack and a major interrogation program. I was bored out of my life.Only after that the movie revealed itself: a tale of redemption. Things got more disturbing and captured my attention. The cast was all good. Willem Dafoe had too little screen time to make a mark.In reflection, the style and storytelling were similar to First Reformed, but Reformed was way more disturbing, and I could see where the movie was going, which was scary. Card Counter, though, felt directionless for the majority of its runtime, so I didn't feel the impact much.Overall, it's not my taste. 6/10."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11196036/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," A Surprising Standout ",""You know the phrase tilt? Just like a pinball, any man can tilt. You could tilt."Paul Schrader's The Card Counter tells the story of an ex-military interrogator turned gambler given a chance in redemption. Soon enough, this road takes him down a path haunted by the ghosts of his past. This is a case where the trailer didn't match the level in which that movie was at. I watched the trailer two or three times and didn't feel it necessary to watch it, even with the greatness that is Paul Schrader. But once the early reviews rolled in from Venice, it surprised us all. Luckily, there was an advanced screening last week and I could attend. We may have been a little late to take our seats and had to sit in the very front row in front of a 40 foot tall screen, but it was worth it. The Card Counter is an interesting thriller that you don't see too often. Schrader has a distinct style. Those who've seen his films know it, and it comes quint in handy here. Had this been in the hands of anyone else, it probably would've been one of those January or August movies that only makes box office money one week and never talked about again. This is indie so it won't make too much, but it's one to remember. The screenplay is smart and well written. The dialogue never felt awkward to me and had a nice flow.We had a great ensemble of actors for this. Oscar Isaac never disappoints, and though his character is mysterious and we could've gotten a little more, he is very good. Tye Sheridan has more than I expected, but I forgot how good of an actor he is. He's one of those actors that you can tell will have this amazing performance someday and become a household name. As for Tiffany Haddish, I felt a bit conflicted. She fit her character on and off. Maybe it's the writing or just characterization, but I wanted to like her more. It was like she was trying to be serious but she also provides the comedic moments throughout. I think she's a good actress, but maybe this wasn't exactly the best fitting role for her. The story takes quite a few turns. Slowly, and this is a slow burn, it becomes so intense that you're at the edge of your seat. Sometimes it becomes hard to tell where it's trying to go, or goes in places it really doesn't need. The ending conflicted me. I like it, but it didn't need to fall into the place it did. In order to be plausible, we would've needed a scene or two extra. The score and cinematography fit the dark story. The trailer shows a strange combination of camera work, and it may seem weird out of context, but once you see it play out it works well. Everything falls into place nicely. Paul Schrader is a writing and director that I find myself getting excited for with each new film. This isn't his best, but one that surprises and stands out this year."

He was a Private who worked at the Abu Ghraib prison and was among those soldiers pictured in the notorious pictures of interrogators with prisoners who experienced "enhanced interrogation" techniques. Tell manages his guilt by an extremely repressed personality that gambles on a modest scale to avoid notice. He is skilled at counting cards at Blackjack and is skilled at Poker because of his disciplined playing within the percentages of success he has learned during his prison years.At one of the casinos he visits that is holding a military convention, he sees Major John Gordo/Rogers (Willem Dafoe), an ex-military man who, as a private contractor, taught enhanced interrogation techniques to Tell and others but was never charged. At the same convention, Tell encounters Cirk (Tye Sheridan), the son of one of Tell's colleagues at the prison who became abusive to his wife and Cirk before finally killing himself. Cirk wants Tell to help him capture, torture, and kill Gordo.Tell resists Cirk's request and tries to persuade Cirk to reconcile with his mother. He wants to help Cirk, who has many debts, and finally agrees to enter the celebrity gambling world with the help of a manager named La Linda (Tiffany Haddish). Over time Tell's repression recedes enough to allow a romantic relationship with La Linda.Tell gives Cirk a substantial amount of money just before entering the final round of the World Series of Poker, and Cirk agrees to reconcile with his mother. However, Cirk also decides to still go after Gordo.Despite the drama of the storyline, this is a word-heavy movie with only a few scenes of violence. The verbal descriptions are sometimes more graphic. The portrayal of William Tell by Oscar Isaac, in my view, is Oscar-worthy. Tiffany Haddish is also excellent. Tye Sheridan is less strong, and Willem Defoe essentially only has a bit part.I would have given the film a higher score, but the film's climax suffers believability issues. It deserved a better screenplay in the last 10 minutes or so."

The characters are never shining, and becomes way to dark."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11204060/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," A superb film on all fronts ","I thoroughly enjoyed this movie; captivating performances by the entire cast and thoughtful technical execution throughout.But what truly makes this film stand out is it's commitment to the story, with every element of every scene working to explore the core themes of Pagten. I was not familiar with Blixen before seeing this film, but judging by her portrayal within, it seems a fitting tribute to a woman so profoundly committed to the art of storytelling.Without giving too much away, I particularly enjoyed the use of light, as Blixen's influence waxed and waned, it felt as though she was the moon reflecting the light of some higher power onto those she orbited; casting some in shadow and illuminating others, but never for too long. A beautiful metaphor that rings true throughout and tickles the mind long after the credits have rolled.Kudos as well to the sound design and musical director for excellent choices and attention to detail. The transition of the main theme, from diegetic to scoring a montage was done beautifully; the crackle of the phonograph dying out seamlessly in spite of the slow but steady pacing."

However, when the three's latest performance is recorded and goes viral, the band meets, Lang, a music promotor, who invites them to go on tour with pop sensation Lil' Foxy (voiced by Kathleen Barr). However, in the process, Bodi is pressured by Lang to change his image and personality, causing a rift between him and his bandmates, and to make matters worst, Lang is plotting to steal Bodi's powers to use for his own evil deeds.Yeah, this is a sequel by Splash Entertainment, the same company who helped Lionsgate with those horrid sequels to Alpha & Omega and Norm of the North, but this one is actually good. Like every DTV video, the voice cast is different (Bodi is now voiced by Graham Hamilton, who replaces Luke Wilson, and Darma is now voiced by Ashleigh Bell, who replaces Mae Whitman, among other recasts). Thankfully, the voices are okay, as some of them manage to nail how the characters voiced in the last film (Khampa is spot on, despite being voiced by Brain Drummond, but does a good job getting close to J. K. Simmons' voice, but with a lower pitch). Also, we get some new characters, like Norbu and Maydow, Bodi's grandparents, and red pandas Wei and Shumai, alongside Lil Foxy and Lang.The story is good, with a neat moral about staying true to who you are. The only complaint I have is that some of the script relies on word play, as some dialogue use song titles like Stairway To Heaven and Paint It Black), which while neat given the characters are rock stars, can be a bit tiring. Otherwise, this is a good sequel for kids."

That's about as nice as I can put it.It seems that not a single soul involved with the original production wanted to touch this one. It's pretty clear why.The animation is very stiff. The characters often have a blank expression on their face, almost as if their minds blank out for a split second every so often. The colors are bleak and the rendering is very basic for what is supposed to be a feature.When it comes to the story it is about the most generic and predictable drivel you can imagine. The surprises come in the form of new family members, which I can only imagine were added to uphold a facade of family values plucked straight from the 50's. Unsurprisingly we get a sprinkle of the classic boomer "Social Media Bad" morals. That was definitely the highlight of the movie because "I'm trending down" is not a sentence I thought I'd ever hear. It's embarrassing to watch this movie.I was not planning to write a review for this movie, but I feel obligated after seeing the review page littered with what must be either Splash Entertainment employees or cult members praising this movie and recommending it for kids & families.Do not make your kids watch this, 2021 has been a great year for animation, so pick something good like "Luca" or "Wish Dragon" instead. Better yet, watch the original "Rock Dog". It's pretty decent.I want to recommend Rock Dog 2 specifically for you and your friends to laugh at, because it is a spectacular train wreck. Unfortunately it looks like there's a third movie coming, and at that point I'm afraid the joke may have gotten old."

I mean just the fact that you have a character ... "stuck" (literally) ... I am not even sure how to describe or explain that. But I don't have to, as the movie does not have to either.Apart from that, there are many jokes, many related to aging and coming to understand one self or others - and really being able to let go of things too of course.

However I didn't like the movie.I believe the movie looks like a great project on paper, but for some reason the directors and writers failed to convey that to us. There are some ridiculous scenes that have no place not only in this movie, but in any movie. I watched every second of it with the hope that it would get better and everything would make sense in the end, but unfortunately I finished it quite unsatisfied and utterly disappointed.I don't understand how absurdity is very popular in Turkish movies, yet nobody has ever used it deservedly. For instance in this movie, you see absurdity being used excessively and very unnecessarily so that it gets impossible for you to get involved. It is also partly because of the characters that were written down and dirty.One of the writers Berkun Oya already proved his great ability to write thanks to very succesful series Innocent and Ethos that he wrote himself, but for some reason he could not show this ability in this film. Collaboration of the directors Taylan brothers with the actors Engin Gunaydin & Binnur Kaya was also much better in Vavien, which is one of my favorite Turkish movies. Therefore Stuck Apart is unfortunately nothing but a disappointment for me."

Sure, it has it's shortcomings but no way near the hate it's getting here. I don't think this movie was intended for Turkish audiences, who are very vanilla most of the time when it comes to any form of art. I don't know what this movie claimed to be during the advertising period but if you watch it expecting a "normie" comedy, you'll be disappointed. That exact reason is why I enjoyed it. It can be called dark comedy-ish I guess, labels don't matter to me. The art direction was quite beautiful and the acting was decent, as expected from a cast of veteran actors. Comparing this to the dumpster fire that was Leyla Everlasting is a blasphemy."

They managed to gather some good actors/actresses in town, including Engin Gunaydin, Haluk Bilginer, Oner Erkan, Ilker Aksum, Okan Yalabik, Binnur Kaya and Gulcin Santircioglu.

Not recommending it as they are solely related with the culture we live in.The movie in summary is reflecting three lives' desperations with some humorous scenes in between. Plot doesn't have a general theme or conclusion, thus not leaving us an expectation or release in the end. The funniest scenes were where the little nephew of Aziz was acting. Overall, recommending it if you have some free time to chill to enjoy your non-desperate life by comparing yours to theirs."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11213372/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Relatively Flat Character Study ","Lets be honest, you are all asking yourselves what did I watch? How were these actors cast in this, and who funded it?But first some backstory... This film was the first writing credit for the Taylan brothers, and they unapologetically gave us an avant-garde Turkish character study. In Turkey there are two types of stories; the traditional 3 act structure that most of us are used to called the "Olay Oykusu" OR the character study / "glimpse into the life of" pieces that have a very thin plot, and spend more time on character, called "Durum Oykusu". Azizler my friends, is the latter, a story where we glimpse into the ridiculous and unbelievable lives of our protagonists. Although this version of storytelling is dominant in biographical stories (Roma, Kaybedenler Kulubu) it is rare to see this format in a minimalistically fantastical world - and lets all be honest, it was too bizarre. As for our actors, this type of story is where they truly get to flex their acting muscles since the movie depends on it and they have quite the range to do what they want.Since this is the first writing piece from the Taylan brothers, one can assume that they are still fine tuning their skills and that they have more to grow. Thankfully Netflix has enough cash to throw at them, probably for the sake of creating a relationship and I assume gave them final cut. This resulted in a 6/10 film that was too off the beaten path for its own good. Will you like this film if you don't watch award films? No. Will you watch this because it is all the A-listers best work? Probably not. Should you get baked before watching this? Absolutely... But what did you expect - actually though what did you expect?If you watch this movie, you should do so for the views and so that Netflix spends more money in Turkey. Maybe if enough of us watch these Turkish films, Netflix might greenlight a "Roma" of our own."

Her US returned grandson promises her that. Unfortunately, she is not able to travel there for certain reason. "No worries", says sonnie dear. "If you can't go to that Lahori Ghar, the house will come to you!!"An interesting concept with bit of Gadar (2001) wala aggression and Bajrangi Bhaijaan (2015) ka brotherhood formula thrown in; Sardar Ka Grandson still turns to be a just about average fare due to its wishy washy screenplay and a lead actor called Arjun Kapoor who lacks the star power or charisma to pull off any venture on his own.On the films positive, Neena Gupta as the granny leaves a mighty impression even though her prosthetics suck. A fantastic performance indeed!! Rakul Preet Singh hardly gets any scope though she looks absolutely gorgeous in the film. The supporting cast comprising Kanwaljeet Singh, Soni Razdan and Kumud Mishra are earnest as ever. John Abraham is brilliant in a cameo.Not too good nor too bad, Sardar Ka Grandson can be watched if you are holed up at home in this lockdown. See it and forget it.

"," Sardar Ka Grandson, On Netflix, Has Stretches Of Eye-Glazing Tedium ","In 2013, Amit Sharma, who went on to direct the stellar Badhaai Ho, made an ad film for Google called Google Search Reunion. In it, childhood friends, who were separated during Partition, find each other thanks to an enterprising granddaughter and the internet. In three minutes and thirty-two seconds, Amit captures the ache, nostalgia and yearning for a lost life, and the eventual get-together. Each time I watch the commercial, I get teary.Sardar Ka Grandson had the potential to pull off something similar. The film tells the story of Amreek, a doting grandson who decides to fulfil his 90-year-old grandmother's last wish - to once again see her house in Lahore. When the grandmom, Sardar, is denied a visa, Amreek does the next best thing. With the help of his partner, Radha, he brings the home back to Punjab so Sardar can once again relive those moments of love and loss."

This is the film for you. He beats old timer Sunny Deol hollow with this exercise.Our grandma ( Neena Gupta ) aged 90 living in USA with her joint family has a last wish to see her home in Lahore. She can't travel to there. So young sweet chubby Arjun Kapoor says " No problem grandma, I will get the house to you ". To help him achieve his mission he has girlfriend played by Rakul Preet and of course there should be obstacles to cross which are put there by the mayor of Lahore played by Kumud Mishra.Pretty entertaining stuff over popcorn with no questions asked. Neena Gupta acts well though she doesn't look 90, no wrinkles there. Arjun as the grandson is passable. ( He definitely needs to hit the Gym and take acting classes if he intends to stay in mainstream Bollywood movies) .Somehow the warmth between grandson and grandmother was missing. Rakul Preet doesn't have much of a role to impress. She looks pretty though. Credit to the director for all the hard work in picturisation of the scenes of the truck carrying the house and also for the simple treatment given to the film."

The first 30 minutes and the last 10 minutes of the movie are only watchable. The first half promises that the film is a light-hearted rom-com but the second half feels like a stretch and lacks depth, neither its romance nor comedy connects with the viewers.Although the premise was interesting as it has a very fresh concept which not seen before in an Indian film. But the emotional side of the story is not explored effectively and most of the scenes fall flat.Despite the sluggish writing, Neena Gupta managed to shine in her role and delivered a good performance. Arjun Kapoor failed to carry the film on his shoulders and struggles when it comes to an emotional scene. Rakul Preet Singh is underutilized and her presence hardly impacts the film.

However, upon meeting him, I regret ever having shortlisted him. The first few moments with him were horrible, almost prompting me to dismiss him right away. There were indeed a few moments, especially surrounding the unique idea, that aroused interest. However, he lacked maturity, smartness and fondness that you normally associate with a feel-good role.****The flick starts off on the wrong foot, with shabby over-the-top humour intertwined with bland portrayal of romance and relationships, except maybe for certain one-off scenes of warmth between Sardar and her grandson.The theme of shifting an old building as a whole across borders, did arouse some interest at the beginning. However, lack of proper research on the subject and the nuances associated with it were all too evident and whatever little attention that it managed to muster, was short-lived. The comedy scenes, amidst all the shifting imbroglio, too failed to create the desired result.Overall, it turned out to be a lame attempt, which could've been a lot better had the interesting concept been executed with some maturity, intelligence and warmth."

They are good with their English shows and foreign titles but they have bad Hindi movies in their catalog. Drive. Mrs. Serial Killer. Ginny Weds Sunny. Chopsticks. House Arrest. Maska. The Girl on the Train and now, this one.Arjun Kapoor- Our so-called hero is the main reason why this movie is a complete failure. He is lazy as an actor. There is not a single shot where he is trying to impress you. Further, the writing is poor where we don't see meaty roles and dialogues.John and Aditi managed to offer some relief. They look good as a couple. Further, you have Neena Gupta as the Dadi and Kanwaljeet Singh as Arjun's father and Neena's son. Don't have any major expectations here as they all have sketchy roles but at least, they look a little genuine.The whole scenario where Arjun is in Pakistan is the worst part of the movie. The scenes and most importantly, the idea of lifting a century-old house looks plain stupid.

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11213600/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","3"," Lost each and every opportunity! ","Sardar ka Grandson could've actually been a good film, had they used some brains into making this film. The idea of house shifting is quite novel, but shifting it from Lahore to Amritsar? All this is possible only in countries with wider roads that too with specialised truck, but again this is a Bollywood film logic will be dead in every space! This film is a cluster of Kapoor and Sons, Bajrangi Bhaijaan, Gadar and some Bollywood rom coms(Sounds weird? But it's true). The screenplay direction everything was scattered with all the loose ends suddenly getting lost. Starts off differently, continues in different space and ends weirdly, but somewhat convincing due to Neena Gupta's performance(we need her in more and more films!)Story starts with typical Bollywood rom com in USA, then starts getting loud punjabi angle with touch of Kapoor and Sons, later on Gadar love story and moves ahead with Bajrangi Bhaijaan type India Pakistan story of love, house shifting being the core. It should've either been love story set in two different times, or simply shown how the hell did the house actually reached India in such narrow roads, but rather made cluster of everything, in the end ruined chance. The screenplay was too loose, lousy, irritating in the name of humour in some scenes while in other scenes it was decently enjoyable but nothing else! Music is either plain mediocre or lifted from old songs like always zero creativity. One of the writer of this film had written Zoya Factor, hence it makes sense how writing of this film can be.Performances wise the Neena Gupta ji stole the show. Despite of having over the top character and bad prosthetics, her presence was the best thing about this film, from her expressions, voice, body language no doubt Neena Gupta was the soul of Sardar ka Grandson. She reminded me of Late Rishi Kapoor's character in Kapoor and Sons yet almost matched the performance Late RK gave, just wished she had better makeup team and script to make this film a worthwhile. Besides Neena Gupta it was Aditi Rao Hydari portraying younger version of same character with complete finesse. There was problem in her accents, but she was lovely in her performance as well, unfortunately her role was too short used only in flashbacks. I wish this was a pure family rom com about two generations. Now coming to film's actual lead, ARJUN KAPOOR! He is a plain bad actor, there's no second thought about it but still somehow gets more and more films to work on, WHY? I understand he must be a good natured boy, but that doesn't mean he should act more in films or just learn acting and work! Till 2 States everyone thought Arjun will be next big thing but that film was also released more than half a decade back, why should we watch Arjun Kapoor more because of that? You have better actors like Rajkummar Rao Amit Sadh Ayushmann Vicky Kaushal Jeetu Bhaiya Naveen Kasturia Sunny Hinduja and should I name more? Please don't make another incident like Sushant Singh Rajput, you all need to honour him not mock his soul! Arjun Kapoor was well supported by Rakul Preet in bad acting, she too has literally limited expressions even though no match for Arjun in mediocrity. Kanwaljeet Singh Soni Razdan Kumud Mishra every other actors were royally wasted in this lot. And the so called star cameo of John Abraham was even worse, no effort in accent despite of being Punjabi his accent sounded like random Mumbaikar, even worse get up. Except for one small action sequence which was unneeded, John Abraham was another waste, but being a producer he wanted footage for himself as well.Bollywood has successfully ruined its image, scattered into pieces. Out of 100-200 films hardly 1-2 are watchable these days besides all others are garbage. Going with 3 stars only for Neena Gupta and Aditi Rao Hydari, besides Arjun Kapoor and gang made sure this film is a complete disaster, or perhaps the film's script was changed to make it bad because of Arjun's entry into the film."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11213600/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," Only Regrets Here! ","I had mixed feelings about watching this movie after watching the trailer. The story looked interesting but the trailer itself showed me the entire movie in 2 minutes. It also didn't help that Arjun Kapoor is the lead actor. But on the other hand a part of me also wanted to watch it for Neena Gupta & Aditi Rao Hydari. And despite my better sense, my love for Neena & Aditi made me watch it. And oh boy did I regretted my decision.Yes, Arjun Kapoor's acting was fake & annoying, and I expected it to be, but what the hell was up with that FAKE ASS PUNJABI ACCENT that they made John Abraham and Aditi speak in the Lahore flashback scenes? I cringed hard. On top of that the set design for those Lahore scenes were also so fake that it felt like someone had shot a theater play instead of a feature film.The director, despite having a novel idea, did not know how to execute it. The movie randomly switched from being a love story, to slapstick comedy, to a partition film, then a family drama and something about a convoluted petty ego Villain thing, without maintaining any consistency whatsoever.This is a perfect example of everything that is wrong with Bollywood. Talents like Neena and Aditi are given next to no screen time and mediocrity has been presented front and center as the protagonist."

Hockey has been a underrated game in India for decades. So, we really should appreciate & encourage such movie makers.That song 'Sagame telisina abhimanyudu Ani sambarapadavaddhuraa Padmavyuham chedhin chagalige Arjunudu veeduraa Kyaa re yadhi settingaa leka Bhayapadi meeroka sweatingaa Edu kondalu mokkingaa Aata joosthe meeku seatu siragadha' is just lit & it's why many north Indians support south Indian cinema rather than bollywood.The thing I didn't like is there are lots of game mistakes in the movie. Such as rising the ball too high. In hockey, rising ball over player's shoulder is deemed to be dangerous & given free stroke. Ball shouldn't not be raised over 18' inches from field in corner strikes. But, there's a false depreciation of gameplay in the movie shown as heroic. Also, ball cannot be striked in mid-air & ball needs to be positioned to field before forwarding.Let's make hockey popular again."

","Well, I will admit that I wasn't really expecting much from the 2021 movie "Hatched" when I sat down to watch it. Sure, I liked the movie's cover/poster, but it definitely had that 'oh, it's going to be one of those horrible CGI movies' feel to it. But still, I opted to watch it.And I will say that the movie wasn't actually as bad as I had initially feared it to be. Sure, this wasn't by no means a milestone in cinematic history, but it was better than I had anticipated it.Granted, the storyline told in the movie made little or no sense at all, and there were just so many plot holes throughout the course of the movie. Not to mention the stupidity of the actions performed by the characters in the movie. So yeah, in terms of a proper script and plot, then "Hatched" was a less than mediocre movie.Visually then I found "Hatched" to actually be a surprise. The movie definitely had much nicer CGI renderings of the dinosaurs than I had thought it would have. But the CGI could only do so much for a movie that lacked a proper script and storyline.The acting in the movie was a bit of a mixed bag of nuts so to speak. Some of the performers actually put on adequate performances with whatever little they had to work with, while others put on lukewarm or amateurish performances.Directors Scott Jeffrey and Rebecca Matthews just didn't really manage to come up with an overwhelmingly interesting movie here. It felt like a "Jurassic Park" movie on a very, very tight budget. But hey, at least it wasn't as bad as the dinosaur movies that is churned out by The Asylum.Ultimately then "Hatched" is a semi-watchable movie, albeit not an overly interesting or entertaining one. I am rating it a less than mediocre four out of ten stars. This is, however, not a movie that I will be returning to watch for a second time, nor is it one that I will run out and encourage people to rush in to watch."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11217094/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," Dinos attack ","You know, if you're going to bring dinosaurs back to life, make sure they don't eat you and your wife. That's the lesson that I learned from Hatched, which begins with Simon David (Thomas Loone, Clownface) hatching some giant retro beasts just in time for them to turn him and his partner Christine (Amanda-Jade Tyler) into a quick snack.However, before all that dino dining, Simon also learned how to bring his son back from the dead. Again, I think we all know by now just how bad of an idea playing God is.Scott Jeffrey wrote The Candy Witch and also directed HellKat, ClownDoll, Bad Nun: Deadly Vows and plenty more lower-budget horror films. He made this with Rebecca Matthews, who he also made Cam Girls and Cannibal Troll with; she directed The Candy Witch, Pet Graveyard and Witches of Amityville. Jeffrey also produced Dinosaur Hotel, another low budget dinosaur movie about an underground game show that has dinosaurs hunt people for the pleasure of the elite.It takes a lot of guts to make a dinosaur movie with limited funds. Luckily, this movie has some exciting scenes and plenty of soldiers battling scaly beasts, which is really what I'm usually looking for."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11217094/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Solid and cheesy creature feature ","After missing out on several communication attempts, a woman and her family head out to a farmhouse owned by their reclusive brother to check on what happened to him, only to discover that an experiment has created several living dinosaurs forcing them to find a way to get away from the house alive.This was quite a fun genre effort. Among the more enjoyable facets to this one is the intriguing and enjoyable setup that manages to play off quite nicely as for getting the group stranded at the house and into danger. As we're given a glimpse of what he's supposedly doing with his research and experiments at the beginning with keeping them locked up and away from the family requiring the rest of them to head up to check on him for his strange disappearance, everything is in order to keep them at the house long enough for the dinosaurs to emerge. With the revelations of what he's doing and how they came to be, the film generates some intriguing aspects to get it started. Once it gets this setup started, the film gets a lot to like with the dinosaur attacks which is the main point of the film. Focused mainly on the Rex getting some fun ambush sequences where it comes out of the wilderness to snap up victims in a messy fashion, these are rather fun while setting up the smaller-scale sequences of the group interacting with the Raptors more frequently in the house. The chasing featured in those scenes is handled well enough to generate some impressive suspense in the race to get away from the creatures and get to safety which is matched rather nicely with the initial arrival of the military to help save them. This mix of ambush sequences and action-packed stalking allows for a nice mix which is quite enjoyable here. That carries over into the final half where there's an enjoyable mix of action and even more enhancements to the story that ties everything together rather nicely. The dinos going through the commandoes which has some highly impressive attacks with the creatures getting some fun screentime, much like the finale out in the surrounding woods that introduces a few rather unexpected elements into the story. These new additions to the story, which flesh out the side-effects of the experiments and what can potentially happen to the dinosaurs in the future, this section of the film gives this a lot to like that manage to hold the film up for the most part. There isn't a whole lot that holds this one down. One of the biggest drawbacks is the seemingly random inclusion of the small military force that's designed to protect them only to end up being two ill-equipped commandoes, an insane leader, and a useless scientist. Based on the information given at that point in time, there's no reason for that squad to be this small in terms of a rescue mission even if we later learn the true reason for their arrival which is even less logical. On top of that, there are the usually expected limitations with the dinos on such a small budget, ranging from some struggles with integration into the environment properly to proportion problems and repeating movements that highlight how unnatural they really are which is to be expected here but doesn't come off as detrimental overall.Rated Unrated/R: Graphic Violence and Graphic Language."

Then 5 minutes in I realized how bad the acting was. The actors made a good effort, so maybe this is more so to do with directing. Girls witness their mom getting eaten and they react like ''oh no aw shucks, oh well crap happens''. Just no emotion. Also the little kid who was brought back to life, looked like a girl but they kept calling her ''mark'', then later I find out it's an actual boy. Odd. Death scenes were boring, most of time you don't see anything, it jump cuts to the dinosaur chewing and someone screaming."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11219254/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," Artistic Youth's Love beat by Reality ","Even a week after watching the movie We Made a Beautiful Bouquet, I still couldn't get rid of the sadness it gave to me. So right here, I start to write my thoughts down in order to commemorate it, the first love movie which touched me so deeply.I've search this movie on IMDB, surprisingly found that there are only 591 comments about it, with average stars 7.1, compared to 79826 comments with average stars 8.7 on Chinese film review website Douban, which made me profoundly aware of the cultural difference between the east and the west.As it says, the whole movie is talking about love between an artistic youth couple beat by cruel reality."Those two, they don't like music." "Pardon?" "The music is not monophonic, but bi-vocal. With one wired headphone, the left-side sound and the other side is different. It's another song when you listen to it with only one side of headphone." "The song mixers must be pissed off and have thrown out the midnight snack." Kinu and Wataru explained to their respective partners that two men share a same wired headphone is definitely a dishonor to music, not knowing that just a table away, standing a similar soul.When they met again because of missing the last train, they and another couple of man and woman stayed in a bar, waited for the next day coming.Mamoru Oshii just sit not far away and the man started to talk about movie."People says that I'm a movie buff." The woman asks, "what movies do you watch?" "The Shawshank Redemption." "I heard about it." "It's a super touching movie." "Really? I watched Kiki's Delivery Service last year." "The live-action version?" "Yes." Wataru, wearing a constipated face, thought in his head."why the real master is in front of them, they are still talking about the live-action version of Kiki's Delivery Service. The are so many live-action versions in just because of you people?" Kinu just sit aside without saying anything.Then after the four said goodbyes, Kinu caught Wataru, with a smiling face, and asked."It was OshiiMamoru, right?" "You know him?" "Whether you like him or not, you should know him at least." "Sure, he is the greatest." "You are right." Kinu nodded.Then they came to a izakaya (Japanese Pub), and started a real conversation."I'm Kinu Hachiya. My favorite saying is 'free refill for noodles'." "I'm Wataru Mizuno and my favorite saying is 'stuff like spade'." They exchanged they reading notes, talked about Hironagashu and Homura's poems, their favorite writers and bands, their common habits of using movie stubs as bookmarks, ended up with finding that they both bought the tickets of guinea-pig exhibition and missed it.I recalled the so-called Bible for artistic youth, Before Sunrise trilogy, where Jesse and Celine also started their conversation with the books they read when met on train. So if you want to step in a artistic youth's world, just go to read the books she reads, the movies she watches.And when she stands in front of your house bookshelf, says like Kinu in the movie, "It's exactly the same version of my bookshelf", it's time for you two to become one.After a couple of times of missing the last train, Wataru expressed his feelings to Kinu.And I thought that's it, a simple lovely Japanese movie.But it's not.Wataru and Kinu set foot in the real society after graduation.Kinu cried under a high-pressure interview, and Wataru asked."Who is that interviewer?" "A great senior." "He might be great, but he must have no feelings after reading Natsuko Imamura's Picnic." "It doesn't make sense to employment." They started to live together. Wataru got a job at business department, went back home 8 p.m. Everyday. Colleague told him it will be better after 5 year's fighting.Work was getting more and more burdensome. Kinu found that Wataru hasn't touch his once loved paintbrush, could put off the stage play they scheduled, wear a listless face when watching movies, started reading success books instead of poems.In a fierce quarrel, Wataru mentioned a old customer told him to die and spat on him."He is so weird." Kinu said."He is a great man." "He might be great, but he must be emotionless after reading Natsuko Imamura's Picnic." "Maybe I am too now." I shed my tears for the first time when I watched here, but not because of love.Till here, about 4/3 of the movie has passed, and I don't want to keep writing. The rest is worth watching and feeling by yourself.I thought it will be a beautiful romanticism, but eventually I realize the low-plot life is the cruelest realism.Let me quote a heat comment from Douban here: The most romantic love an artistic youth can imagine is that, running in the rainy night when first met, having 100% similar artistic taste, kissing in front of a red light after confession, making love for a whole week in a rent room, living together in a flat with a huge balcony, picking up a cat at New Year's worship, and then break up peacefully after a long time consuming, recall past times at the once visited place, still think of each other when it's rainy outside. It's like the fantasy of people who yearn for love but don't believe it.There are a lot of details worth sharing. If you have time, go and watch it, it will be your best love movie this year."

Does the the film have challenges? Yep and that is not in question. The heart the film, the humor of the film and the performances give a nod to directors who have taken challenges and finished the job. Perhaps not to everyone's likings but I recently saw WonderWoman and with hundreds of millions of dollars all of the creativity that Hollywood could muster, the film still got panned. So, when a new voice rises, I tend to give them the benefit of the doubt. Nice effort and I'm sure it will find it's audience."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11235772/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt"," Pretty good movie with a different take on observing others. ","Many newer IMDb users don't have a clue how to meaningfully review a movie. THIS IS NOT A "1" or "2" MOVIE. So especially ignore the reviews that say this is a trash movie and not worth the time to see it. While it borrows only slightly from "Rear Window" it is a unique story about observing others and the ethics involved. It can be considered a modern fable, not all of it has to be realistic.Set and filmed in Montreal it starts with a young dating couple moving in together. They get a downtown apartment in a medium-rise building, and a similar apartment building is right across the street. It seems few residents pull curtains all the way shut so that makes for some interesting visuals. The story builds nicely towards several interesting twists during the second half. And I won't even mention the sexy soft porn scenes from about 1:21 to 1:25 into the movie, showcasing Ms Sweeney's ample assets.If you like this sort of movie, there are several new things and a bit of wicked revenge, then followed by more wicked revenge. The actors are attractive. The cinematography is done very interestingly, the sound is excellent. If a movie does nothing more than make you think "What would I do in a similar situation?" then it has some value. And this one does.There is a Pippa line, my favorite, about 20 minutes from the end, "Tell me this one thing and you'll never see me again."The most common votes so far are "6" and "7" which is about right for this movie. The production values are good, the acting is fine, the story has some interesting elements. Filmed in Canada.(As an aside Sydney Sweeney fans should look up teenage Irish busker Allie Sherlock, their faces are spitting images of each other.)"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11235772/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","3"," Listless and absurd ","A young couple, Pippa and Thomas, discover that their neighbours are not at all privacy-conscious, allowing them to see all that happens in their apartment. They start spying on them, initially simply out of voyeurism. However, Pippa then starts meddling in the neighbours' lives, with dire consequences.A film that is billed as a steamy thriller but for the most part it is pretty listless and tame, meandering aimlessly about. This results in the film taking about 20-30 minutes longer than it should.When it finally does find a direction it is absurd and implausible. It seems so tangential and ridiculous that It feels like the writer generated it randomly.Not much to recommend (though I didn't mind Sydney Sweeney...).So much for "if you can't make a good movie, make a short movie"."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11235772/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Not a disaster ","A young couple move into an apartment, and the girl becomes obsessive about the sexual behaviour of the couple in the apartment across the way. No-one in this film has curtains or blinds.I was expecting this movie to be a typical skinflick (and it does have a steamy scene featuring the pneumatic Ms Sweeney: this girl has a great future in front of her, and when I say "great future", that's not what I mean at all, know what I mean?).But, in fact, there is a tolerable plot, some interesting ethical issues, a couple of decent twists, some lovely photography and well-crafted sound design, so there is worthwhile stuff to watch.Unfortunately, the male protagonist is annoying and the first half the film is very slow, so there's that, too. That brought it down from 7 to 6 stars for me."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11235772/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Refreshingly explicit thriller, ruined by its own indulgence ","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningPippa (Sydney Sweeney) and Thomas (Justice Smith) are a young couple who live in an apartment in New York City. From the view of their window, they are able to stare across the street into the apartment of fellow young couple Seb (Ben Hardy) and Julia (Natasha Bordizzo) and the open eroticism they enjoy with each other. After a while, what they are able to see crosses boundaries, and when Pippa strikes a friendship with Julia through her work as an optician, it sets in motion a devastating chain of events with deadly consequences.We live in a time where privacy has become largely redundant. If we don't have apps spying on us through our phones, tracking our movements and relaying it to God knows who, or companies selling our data to whoever we inadvertently allow them, to reality TV shows where we spy in on the private affairs of people we don't know for entertainment they're in on, the age where everything felt secure feels long gone. And so, there is at least a refreshing honesty in what they both know they're doing to the central protagonists of director Michael Mohen's dark erotic thriller, an at least pleasingly adult and unrestrained piece with a deeper undertone.Disasterously, it fails initially right at the beginning, introducing us to two undercooked, rather unengaging lead characters, who fail to really draw us in until they start their unethical business. This will write it off for some, but for those who stick around, it does develop in to a more dark and compelling piece, with lead star Sweeney displaying a skittish vulnerability as the girl with a dark secret, while part time East Ender Hardy has a strong presence as the domineering third party player, building up to a shocking conclusion with a dark twist, which gives it the feel of an old Tales of the Unexpected episode, but for some reason it decides to prattle on for another twenty or so minutes, completely ruining what could have been a great ending with a ridiculous turn of events.If it had had the good sense to end when it should have, it could have worked as a dark morality tale, but spoilt by its own indulgence, it leaves a nonsensical lasting impression, despite everything it got right, not least a drowned out new version of Billy Idol's 1983 classic Eyes Without a Face playing over the beginning and end credits. ***"

Two actors that I come to enjoy and they were really good in it together.The story was really good too. If the bottom-line plot is that vengeance is an artform, then this movie has an ending that's almost a masterpiece.However, the story could have been handled better. The movie was a little too over reaching with the trivia (like the fact that one of the Voyeurs is an eye doctor). Things I feel that should have come off as subtle seem to be slapping me in the face whenever I turn around.The actors were pretty good at keeping us in the moment but not good enough for me not to see what was coming next in this predicable erotic thriller.As an erotic thriller however its top notch and it had its melodramatic moments that hit in a cool way."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11235772/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," A hidden gem ","Early on in 'The Voyeurs' I thought we were in for the typical 'Rare Window' storyline we have seen dozens of times before. How wrong I was. This film is very different to that, and has so much more going on. This is one of those rare hidden gems where you see an IMDb rating of only 5.8/10 and could easily discard it, but if you do give it a chance you are so glad you did. I had a great time with this movie.The movie is hyper-sexual. Early on it implies that it is going to be quite modest, but this is very much misleading, and from there the film becomes very erotic for almost the duration. It feels very much like 'Basic Instinct' where there is a genuinely interesting story taking place and the eroticism is just a part of the ingredients.The film is a little longer than average for this type of movie, falling just short of two hours. I found myself so interested and invested in the story that the extra time didn't bother me at all, and instead allowed the movie to move at a more natural pace.The final act of this movie is bonkers. It throws everything it has at the kitchen wall, and most of it sticks. The twists and turns are authentically shocking and really caught me off guard. I can't recommend this film highly enough. Please see it. 9/10."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11235772/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Silly tawdry erotic thriller with aspirations at social commentary it never reaches ","Not only is "The Voyeurs" the kind of movie Steven Soderbergh makes, I also wish that he had made it. Michael Haneke, too. These auteurs would have found a style befitting of the material that would have made it seem plausible, that would have kept us engrossed, and that, hopefully, would not have required the ridiculous, jarring twists and turns that the movie ends on.The young couple move into an apartment in Montreal with windows that look directly into an apartment across the street. The very first time they look, they watch the couple in that apartment have sex. They continue to watch, get turned on, and even go so far as planting a listening device.The climactic twist isn't entirely predictable. I wasn't surprised. But still, Soderbergh or Haneke could have put more of a point on it. Here it was a bit "meh", as my generation likes to say.I really think that the twists and turns that come after were put in as an afterthought when the director realised nobody was going to buy what he had sold up to that point. It almost feels like a consolation prize, as though he's saying, "I agree that sucked because I don't have the skill to do it the way Haneke would have... oh well, here's some extra tawdry garbage."He should have just made an erotic thriller. This is more like "Sliver" than "Benny's Video" or even "The Girlfriend Experience". And an erotic thriller would have been more fun. The attempts at seriousness or social commentary come to nothing, and in the final act, are totally abandoned."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11235772/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Should You Stalk This Film, Like The Characters Stalk Their Goals? ","LIKES:Acting: The key concept of this film is the acting and the group of players in this drama are certainly worthy of the Victorian era of acting. Sweeney's drole is a high intensity, moral challenging, spectacle that is a constant rise and fall of emotion. It's contained, it's realistic and she executes her roles so well, even in the more "adventurous" bouts of love making that arise. A nod to her acceptance to put herself in this type of role, Sydney is indeed the central pillar of the movie. Smith does well in his roles, a sort of wavering compass that challenges the excitement of the situation and tries to navigate the moral ambiguity of the modern world. He's got some fun delivery of lines, has some great execution of emotion, and certainly plays the part of the supporting actor well. Hardy and Natasha Liu Bordizzo are also fantastic supporting roles in this movie, as the very party they are viewing in much of this madness. Hardy has that air of creepiness and artistic nature this movie flourishes on, while Bordizzo nails the intriguing, seductive wife who holds much potential in this display. The fearsome foursome will each play a big part in Sydney's performance and the chemistry is quite strong in my opinion.Artistic: Praise to the muses who motivate the new approaches to cinema making and storytelling. The Voyeurs accomplishes the artistic goal and takes concepts we take for granted, molding them into a new piece that is indeed intriguing to watch. The movie's various acts each have a certain style to the mix, taking on a change in attitude that feels very much like a fleshed out play. It's got heat, it's got style, and it does it's best to sort of reflect on the moral decisions brought up in this movie.Some Comedy: It's not my favorite style, but some of the comedy was perfect for a dark and drier atmosphere that this cinema showing focused on. Don't expect slapstick and super clever lines that will be on T-shirts, because it's very little. No, this is the type where irony, quirks, and how our vices are humorous in how dark and self-centered they can be. This dark comedy is meant for a different brand of goer.Assessment of Ethics: The movie is a giant reflection on the modern trends of today's world, at least some of the darker aspects that seem to be the normal. Ethical discussions sort of take place in the banter, but it is the visual style that examines the facets of watching and butting into people's lives. As the obsession grows, the consequences that arise start to really hit home, and the debate to determine the next course to drive the story and hopefully have you reflect too.The Ending: Though not quite as shocking as they were probably going for, I must admit the Voyeurs' ending is really a crowning achievement of climactic finale. The culmination of all the ideas, the exploitation of things you have not noticed, and some of the thoughts the plot may stimulate are well wrapped up as the revelations emerge. I loved the wrap up, the piecing of information together and really bringing the emotional tension to a major height with a very satisfying conclusion. Though there is a stretch of the imagination and it feels a little out of sync with the other parts of the film, but overall it is the cherry on top of the intense sundae.DISLIKES:The Pace: I agree with my fellow reviewers that the pace is pretty bad for much of the ovie. The Voyeurs is a realistic portrayal of life with an artistic lens, and much like real life, this particular focus is a bit boring. The realistic conversations, meeting at cafes and the intro does little to stimulate things and without the fun dialogue and entertainment aspects... it's not the most fun opening. Once the drama starts, you got to be a fan of the dark comedy or the vices that soap operas and modern medical dramas thrive on, or else you will be bored with what they present given not much really moves.The Plot Holes/Logic Gaps: For a movie all about the sinful vices, these moments are going to be excusable, and fans of the genre will also forgive the lack of logic that this movie seems to take pleasure in diving into. The fact that one couple seems to notice, but the others do not is just one of the arguments that someone can throw, alongside several other factors that are a bit of stretch to ignore for those who look for logical layouts. These moments sort of stack upon one another, and depending on if you can get lost in the artistic nature of the film will determine your tolerance. Some other things include the ignorance of certain characters, the reactions when certain information is shared is a bit lacking, and some of how they handle the situations are just a few examples of the logical gap. Fortunately, this movie does handle this in a better way, but I won't say anything else to reduce the risks of spoilers.The Character involvement: As I said, the cast of four have great chemistry, and sadly I would have liked a little more integration and involvement of each other in the lives based on the way the crumbs were being laid. The movie starts trying to lead us down directions that suggest some of these deeper meanings and relationships, but they kind of fizzle out for the focus on the sexier aspects of the movie. Given how long that it took to get to the "meat" of the movie, and even longer to get to the sizzling ending I liked, more integration amidst these four could have been engaging. The secondary and tertiary characters are also much of a waste and given we had to take tangents to involve other facets of life, were really not needed in my opinion.The Porn: Your tolerance for sexual scenes is going to vary, and I'll admit this part of the film serves multiple aspects on the sake of the story. However, it does not mean I want to see it in the nature, manner, and details that they did. The Voyeurs holds little back in hiding the act of intercourse, and some of the endeavors that go with it. While nothing too bestial or alternative role play, it's still not fun for viewers like me to see the awkward nature of watching and acting at the same time. In fact it's a bit gross and awkward, and the fact we see it happen multiple times certainly earns the R rating of the film. This kind of stuff adds little in terms of what I enjoy, so it gets a dislike in just the excess that they chose to bring with it.The VERDICT: The Voyeurs is a movie that is a bit more original, has some spice to it, and is truly an artistic visualization addressing key concepts the world needs to revisit. Bringing shock factor is certainly key to help one readers habits that they may share, and the drama is certainly top notch to rival a modern day drama on say ABC, but with much better acting and control compared to the writing of the tired shows. However, it's very strength of artistry may also be its biggest flaw as well, and the fact that it robs some of the entertainment value that I like in my dramas. The pace is not my speed and takes a while to really get into the intriguing "suspense, focusing on real life relationships that offer little in terms of content. The plot gaps are heavy, and more so the suspense of logic that some story hunters are going to pick apart with ease. Though it handles this well, it requires sticking to the end to see it come together, something that may be difficult given the amount of erotic focus this film does. If that's your cup of tea, hit it up immediately, but if you want more sustenance and a little more engagement, veer away from this film instead.My scores are: Drama/Mystery/Thriller: 7.5 Movie Overall: 6.5."

"," Trashy & Stupid ","An apartment building has all the windows of all the apartments pointing directly into another apartment building's apartments. They can see you, and you can see them. Nobody ever heard of window shades, curtains, roller shades, bamboo blinds, etc?So the characters in this movie have open views to everyone's bedrooms and living rooms, since nobody has shades or blinds on their windows. Like perverts, they spend every evening watching all the sexing up that happens in the apartments across the street. Tenants across the street do drugs, have sex, rape, murder, etc., without any concern for the dozens of people that have a perfect view of their apartment life. Really dumb movie."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11235772/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Another good Rear Window adaptation. ","This is the second adaptation of Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window (1954) I've seen this year (2021). Except this one has an erotic theme to it that makes it fun to watch. It isn't quite Hitchcock good, but it isn't trash either. Sydney Sweeney plays Pippa, an innocent looking girl next door type with a great body and beautiful boobs. She's like a guy's dream come true because she's gorgeous and she is freakier than you are.She's like that dream come true except things turn soar when she butts her nose into the neighbor's marriage and complicate her dude's life. Yeah, so much for that idealized girl fantasy. Nosey b- will be Nosey. It's never a good idea to stick your nose into someone's else's marriage. That can be a fatal mistake in many circumstances. No moral high ground to gain from it.The film has an interesting twist that I won't give out. I thought the film was good right up to the point when Julia waves back at Pippa from her window. Had the film ended there, it would have been a good psychological horror/thriller film. I was planning to give this film an 8/10. But the producers and writers just went to far and added a stupid revenge twist that I felt undermined the rest of the film. Screenwriters, please learn when its time to put away the pen and paper.Again, its not Hitchcock quality and there were some other dumb stuff even before Julia and Seb look back at Pippa, but they weren't fatal mistakes. How on earth would Julia and Seb know Pippa would network search her printer for the twist? (I am being purposely vague here) I was fine with that bad choice in writing. But making Pippa a hero at the end undermines the bad decisions Pippa did that destroyed her relationship with Thomas, the beta male and possibly destroyed another woman in the process. Imagine if Julia really did do what we all thought she done?Making Pippa a hero or anti-hero is like shooting yourself in the foot. I guess some white girls do go back after having black lol.Anyway, I probably will rewatch this film for reasons that will be obvious to lots of guys Thank you Sydney Sweeney, you made up for Amazon's disastrous Cinderella remake last week. I am still working on forgetting James Corden role in that terrible fairytale adulteration.P. S. Amazon, please release the unedited NC-17 version of this film. I promise I will renew my Prime subscription if you release an uncut version!"

","This movie follows the Horror movie trope of casting exceptionally annoying actors to play exceptionally annoying characters, so the audience won't feel sad watching terrible things happen to them. And "exceptionally annoying actors" is the kindest way I could ever describe the two leads; cringe, cringe, cringe. There is eventually a payoff in the story which makes all the aggravation worthwhile, if you hate yourself enough to endure it. One note about many reviewers' claims that the ending is "preposterous & unbelievable". The story is a blend of two real-life court cases regarding voyeurism presented as "art". The Tate Modern Gallery has a skywalk where visitors are encouraged to look through the windows of a neighboring residence; residents attempted to sue for breach of privacy, to no avail. Another controversial art exhibit consisted solely of very intimate photos taken through telephoto lenses into peoples' homes through slits in their windows. This is not unrealistic; it's much too real. Amazon has an excellent selection of blackout curtains, I dunno if I can plug particular brands here but the best ones are merely 7$ per panel and they will give you a Gorgeous Home, safe from creeping & peeping . Worth their weight in gold, I own 4 pairs."

The chemistry was off and his voice made me cringe. I somehow stuck with it and kept watching. Nothing really significant happens for the better part of the film. It kinda reminded me of a soft porn version of Rear Window. There was a predictable twist towards the end, but the best part of the movie was the last 5 minutes. That final scene was great.

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11246434/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","3"," Essentially just another generic zombie movie... ","Well, first of all, let's just be honest, the movie's title is a bit tacky, isn't it? I mean, "COVID-21: Lethal Virus" is bound to offend one or two people out there, having lost loved ones to the current worldwide pandemic. And while I am not really one that is easily offended, I must admit that a different name for this movie would have been a better choice.Regardless, I sat down to watch the 2021 movie "COVID-21: Lethal Virus", as it is a movie that I hadn't already seen. And I must admit that the movie's cover/poster definitely looked interesting. A zombie movie with such a title? Sure, why not.And let's face it, this was just another as-generic-as-it-could-possibly be zombie outbreak movie. And it simply astounds me that not one, but a total of four writers could manage to collectively come up with something as generic and mundane as "COVID-21: Lethal Virus" turned out to be. So this was not an impressive feat from writers Nerea Bermdez, Daniel Hernndez Torrado, Carlos Sis and Diego de la Concepcin.I will go as far as saying that "COVID-21: Lethal Virus" definitely wasn't among the worst of zombie movies that I have sat through. And believe you me, I have seen some dubious zombie movies in my time. Anything even remotely zombiesque, and it is something I will watch. "COVID-21: Lethal Virus" was just a downright mundane zombie movie, that offered absolutely nothing new to the zombie genre, well aside from trying to pass the infection on to the Covid virus, and changing it up to a 21 variant. Clever or tacky? That is a matter of personal preference, of course.The acting in "COVID-21: Lethal Virus" was actually adequate, just a shame that the actors and actresses literally had next to nothing to work with in terms of a properly written and thoroughly thought through script and storyline.With "COVID-21: Lethal Virus" being a zombie movie, of course you need to have some blood and visceral gore in the movie. "COVID-21: Lethal Virus" was sort of a lukewarm in between here; while it didn't really offer much of gore and mayhem for a seasoned gorehound such as myself, then I will say that the effects that were in the movie weren't actually all that bad. Sure, this wasn't grand special effects that will bedazzle you or knock you off your feet, don't get me wrong here.Now, I watch a lot of zombie movies, and something that never really worked for me is the fast, agile and running zombies. That just doesn't sit well with me. Sure, I can understand why newly turned dead people would have more agility and flexibility than those long dead, but then why would the newly turned zombies in this movie have various stages of decay showing already? It just makes no sense. So no, running zombies is always a factor that weighs heavily against the overall enjoyment of a zombie movie for me.While I managed to sit through the entire movie, I can't really claim that I was properly entertained. The movie was semi-watchable, for sure, but it just didn't cut it and ultimately slipped down a slippery slope. This is not a zombie movie that I would recommend you rush out to get your hands on, as it doesn't really got what is needed.My rating of "COVID-21: Lethal Virus" lands on a mere three out of ten stars. It was just too generic and mundane."

One example is in a few minutes and pretty much the same scene it changes from night to day and back to night several times.The other thing which was a let down is they didn't seem to know how to end the movie, surely they could of come up with a twist or something and not just end.Anyway I gave this a 4 which is below average but not bad for a low budget zombie/virus movie. :)"

They are clearly in the wrong industry then. Specially when they are publishing films like this.The camera work was terrible and the script comes across like it was thrown together in a day without any sort of revision. Also good actors don't stick to the script 100% they add a bit of personality into it to make the characters feel more relatable and so you can get a connection to them which is something this film doesn't do at all.This is the sort of thing you would upload to Youtube for joke and not to be taken seriously."

Especially as bad as this one.The script is awful and the main reason I only gave this two stars. I have no worries about characters swearing, but I suspect who ever wrote this was paid by the word and had one character barely manage a single sentence without swearing. Characters would shout at other characters telling them to not be noisy and there were plenty of other stupid situations.The acting is often bad and only occasionally manages to be OK. One actor would change from angry adult to petulant schoolgirl, seemingly unable to keep to one character. In terms of acting, the crowd scenes were better than many other low budget films I have seen.Continuity is something that did not appear to concern the filmmakers. With multiple mistakes including one period where day became night twice in one day. Characters pointed out to be physically fit would be puffing and panting after running a few yards and then appeared to run for several hours with relative ease.Surprisingly whilst this film will never win awards for make up or special effects, both were better than you might expect from such a badly made low budget film.A less awful script, with characters that were not all complete idiots could have earned this film a couple of extra stars."

[+42%] ","One, written by Bobby-Sanjay and directed by Santhosh Vishwanath, has a couple of novel ideas up its sleeve but the film feels like a laboured watch. The writing is the main culprit here - Bobby-Sanjay who usually pick contemporary subjects for their screenplays and place flesh-and-blood characters in them (albeit with some soapy sentiment added), struggle when it comes to telling a story with (dirty vs idealistic) politics as its backdrop. The lead character of the film is the Chief Minister of the state, played by Mammootty. While the actor commands solid screen presence, this isn't a role that needs him to be too massy or realistically grounded. One treads the middle ground, frequently oscillating between the two. As such, it is neither as mindlessly entertaining as a Lucifer nor as profound as a Left Right Left. The preachy nature of the screenplay gets to you after a point, and the one-too-many subplots (without any payoffs) don't help either!"

He has proved that again and again right from Oru CBI Diary Kurippu to most recently, Abrahaminte Santhathikal.When the teasers and trailers of 'One' released, like any Ikka fanboy, I was also hoping for another firebrand political archetype like Joseph Alex (The King).But alas, the importance of direction and a gripping screenplay is glaringly obvious in the narration of the film. There are several good bits, but the overall watch felt disjointed, overlong and mundane.Director Santhosh Vishwanath's had all the tools in the toolbox but not the wherewithal to pull off the subtle balancing act of providing star-powered mass scenes while remaining uncompromising on narrative appeal.It is here that films like Lucifer stand out. 'One' is yet another case study in what could have been.A one-time-watch for hardcore Mammootty fans since Ikka oozes gravitas in every scene. Unfortunately, the film doesn't offer much else."

"," One, Starring Mammootty, Is A Portrait Of A Leader As A Democratic Man ","One is a character study of Kadakkal Chandran (Mammootty), a fictional chief minister of Kerala, through the eyes of the people he represents. Before we even meet Chandran, we see how Dasappan (Salim Kumar) and his family get unwittingly embroiled with the state when his kids Sanal (Mathew Thomas) and Seena (Gayatri Arun) anonymously post a scathing message about the chief minister on Facebook. A film about a politician who puts people first begins with an extended sequence about their problems."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11250720/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","3"," Mammooty YES. Film NO. ","One is political film having very well written characters but a very dull screenplay. It is quite obvious that the main character and his political beliefs are moulded around the current Kerala CM and his communist party. It is neither a lack of imagination nor unavailability of content that made film makers do this but an attempt to gain goodwill of ruling party. Unfortunately the release got delayed by more than a year. Its not unacceptable but a very evident attempt to white wash a real life party is irritating. Same with Vivek Oberoi starring Modi Biopic.Despite having a strong character, the film fails with very weak plot and dialogues that doesn't inspire. A Pinarayi Vijayan biopic would've been more watchable.Despite having 2.5hr running time and good actors, there is no memorable story nor scenes. Mammooty is perhaps the most apt actor to portrat a strong power carrying figure ( The King, Roudram etc) And One was supposed to be the one of the best political films. Yet it doesn't even rise to a level that keeps audience thrilled. Sthalathe Pradhana Payyans / Lion 2006 are still the top of line 'political films'. Bobby Sanjay, the writers that made many great films should re evaluate themselves. The direction is another negative point. A better direction would've made this same film very interesting.Missing the old Joshy/Shaji Kailas//Renji Panicker films that thrilled a generation.Mammooty, Murali Gopy were obviously succesful in portraying their characters very well. Hoping the same cast stays for a better poltiical film."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11250720/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," ONE to avoid! ","It is certainly not your One of a kind flick, being heavily influenced by yesteryear political thrillers in terms of an exaggerated plot with One over-the-top protagonist. In spite of featuring a wide range of seasoned actors, the casually written and executed flick does not divulge deep into the specifically interesting concept that was intended to be portrayed, whereas it sways from One cliched plotline to the other in a disorganised manner.---------------------The slo-mo scenes of the protagonist striding along, draped in an extraordinarily white mundu and pitch-black chappals form a considerable part of the flick. The exaggerated plotlines glorifying the one protagonist remind us of the yesteryear fan favourite political thrillers, but fail to impress the modern audience, who are used to viewing true to life flicks.The writing and execution have been casual and reek of glaring deficiencies. The contents of the "viral post" that shook even the Chief Minister's office, are not revealed. Albeit, the proposed "Right to Recall" law being the heart of the movie, the concept has not been brought up in greater detail as desired, which turns out to be a major flaw. Rather, the flick sways from one cliched plotline to the other in a disorganised manner, evoking no interest.Despite featuring an array of seasoned actors, the flick fails to leave an impression, with the exception of probably Murali Gopy. Few of the characters do not sync in with the script too. For one, the cowardice of Sanal does not suit his inquisitiveness and firebrand writing capability.One should not waste one's valuable time to watch One. There is nothing new, except maybe for the "Right to Recall" concept that has been poorly presented."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11250720/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," Lacks interesting plot. Below average. ","This movie heavily lacks an interesting plot. So many subplots and so many characters are present, but none of them end up making any lasting impact. It's a seemingly disjoint set of scenes which try to showcase the so called power of the main character, the Chief Minister, Kadakkal Chandran. This is done only because of the star value of Mammootty. They have milked it beyond a level. Slo mo scenes and random long dialogues for practically no reason. Just for some fans to applaud.Some subplots get some heavy build up at first, but they either end up becoming unimportant or they end up getting totally discarded by the makers., leaving the audience wondering why were those subplots even showed in the first place.This movie has a very long list of actors who do character roles. But none of them are actually important. There is Murali Gopi, Joju George, Alancier, Sreejith Ravi, Renjith, Shankar Ramakrishnan, Suresh Krishna, Jagadeesh, Meghanadhan, Prem Kumar, Risa Bava, P. Balachandran etc. You name them, they are there. Some of them are even there just for one scene or two. Why even bring them in here if you are not giving them any real roles.This was like a one man show with no good plot or any character development to make us feel invested. The main conflict is of very low stake. It's just an idea. There was no proper execution of that idea to turn it into something which the viewers would root for.The climax was the most boring part of the whole movie. A few cuts here and there, trimming the run time to just two hours would've at least made this movie a bit more bearable."

","You have this larger than life hero playing the Chief Minister doing things that an ideal political member should be doing but in doing so the makers took out the believability factor off the film. Yes we all would like such a CM but thats not the reality. Mammootty does a very good job of the larger than life CM, infact he could do such roles without breaking a stride.7stars from me for the good intentions other than that it is not that great a film."

After over 13months or so !So obviously my opinion could be dazed a bit due to this.Now the story is interesting, opening and the musical scores were really good. The acting for most part was good and realistic, the ending sort of was kind of a lot down.It should have ended at the resignation I feel or if we are going to show future, we should have seen a bit more on what and how it happened ! As it is right now the extended ending looks made just for mindless fanatical fans."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11250720/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Mammootty's number ONE performance!! ","We've seen movies like Mudhalvan, Bharat ane Nenu, and Sarkar (Tamil) that are based on the concept of an ideal leader that the people want in a Democracy, a leader who is educated, honest, powerful, and compassionate. However, the above movies have had lead characters turning into leaders by provocation, compulsion, and outrage respectively. But, in One, you have an established character of a Chief Minister with all the good values and it is through his life, both professional and personal, that the movies travels through. The writers bring up several controversies and crises that Chandran comes across, but the core idea of the story, also the principal motive of Chandran, is dropped off in the beginning and picked up from somewhere in the end. It was quite intriguing how the first hour of the movie was assembled, but the excitement dips after that. For an actor like Mammootty, the character of Chandran is a cakewalk, in fact, it is his screen presence that keeps the movie floated. A lot of actors come and go, but only a few get to perform, and talented actors like Nimisha Sajayan, Binu Pappu, and Joju George are under-used to a large extent. Even though 'One' speaks volumes for the common man's problems, its fictionalized method of storytelling makes it unconvincing. The writers had in their minds what an ideal Chief Minister should be, and they penned it down accordingly, but the Indian Audience know how stinky and dirty the country's political system is, making the character of Chandran and his actions a hard pill to swallow. But 'One' ends on an optimistic note, promising that there'll be better changes in the country, almost motivating the voters ahead of the Kerala Legislative Assembly elections in April."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11250720/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","1"," Regular hero worship movie ","The movie was supposed to be huge political thriller. Mammooty starred movie has atleast 50+ prominent malayalam actors in small and big roles. But the outcome is disastrous.The very basic problem with movie is just focussing on mammooty as super hero. Too much intro and finally went off far from reality or any particular story line. The story just focused on how great here is the hero! Period.Going the story, a random kid posts an fb post. That becomes viral. In real world, it just goes off! No political party will be bothered. But in movie, it reaches CM and CM meets the kids and becomes the Mayavi for the kid in rest of the movie. Again this movie just become another movie in malayalam which sensationalize tiny story line to make it artificially big issue of concern.The very scene of salim kumar falling down on the floor, people come out from nearby flats and behaves rudely with salim kumar daughter, it never happens! Just for that reason, again the play of coincidence there was SI there and takes revenge by arresting girl on no charges!. The list of defectivenes is story is endless.This movie just reiterates, no matter how much movies stars or superstars are pulled in, a bad story and hero worship will always bring the movie to the floor."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11250720/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," A feel good political entertainer ","The movie'one'starring mamooty mathew thomas joju george etc directed by santhosh viswanath is a feel good polotical entertainer.The story revolves under kadakkal chandran(played by mammooty)who is chief minister of kerala. The filim presents a strong ideal political leader who can bring revolutionary changes in present kerala society. The major positives of this film is its casting bgm screenplay and the performence of actors who played lead roles. I think there is no need of specialy mentioning the performance of mammooty. In some areas film feels like a series of incidents by losing its continuety. For me'one' is an above average feel good movie which can satisfy all kinds of people including family audience esspecialy who are interested in political dramas. Before watching this film you should remember that this is not a mass-masala cinema but some mass dialogues said by mammooty is just awesome. I'm sure that kadakkal chandran will remain as the one of the best charecters played by mammooty in his career."
