Patrick Hill (Jason Statham) barely passes the tests to be the new hire at the company. When his truck gets hit, he turns into the Terminator.This is a Guy Ritchie film. It's a mid-level action thriller. It mostly works although it insists on following the story from all sides which leaves the film at almost two hours. By grouping the different sides separately, they do feel a bit split especially the story of the robbers. I do wonder if the search for the inside man would be a more compelling path. Ritchie is trying for a tighter thriller than his usual. It's him slimmed down. He uses his action skills but this is not going to be considered one of his best or most inventive."

We then get a forty-minute side story on Why Statham Is Not Who He Seems To Be And Who He Really Is.It's a remake of a French thriller, and give the bad guys, it would seem to be just director Guy Ritchie's meat. The problem I have with it is Statham. He doesn't have a wide range, but he's very good at playing bad guys. Unfortunately this role is too comfortable for him, and Ritchie doesn't even attempt to slip some of his humor into the piece. As a result, it's just one big ball of misery and bloodshed throughout, with little variation."

It is clear he is a "dark horse" doing some undercover work, but we don't discover what the back story is until the screen flashes "Five Months Earlier." At this point, what was a simple plot becomes slightly confusing.Jason plays the no emotion "reptile" Jason, shooting everyone in his path. At least he doesn't lose a limb and puts it back on with superglue and a needle and thread. They build up "Hot Betty" and then we never see her.

And while Jason has the looks and drive to feel like an action "hero" of the past - he also has quite the talent to be above that cliche. We know him and even at the beginning of this, when no one of the other characters seem to know what they are dealing with - the audience knows there is more to the man, than we are shown.Having said that, this apparently is a remake of a movie, that as you can tell, I have not seen yet. The original allegedly has more humor and story - which may be true -- I just know that the humor and fun is really wedged and almost entirely put into the first fourth of the movie ... before the action starts to kick in ... quite literally. Although it is more gun play overall.An interesting story even if it seem to have gigantic holes ... but we take them with a spoon full of sugar ... and just let the movie works its magic. Relentless and focused on one thing ... and one thing alone ... the drive and motivation become clear ... and you may even root for him ... despite certain things - like a psych evaluation being necessary to name just one! Since the action is more than rock solid, all is good. And Scott Eastwood ... it's one thing to follow in your fathers footsteps (Clint, but you knew that hopefully), but a different thing to not just have the looks, but the charisma, acting ability and the overall screen presence to warrant that ... he is a bit underused in this, but even so fantastic nonetheless."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11083552/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Quite entertaining... ","Well, wow. Just wow. Guy Ritchie does it again.I have to say that if you enjoy movies from director Guy Ritchie or enjoy movies that has Jason Statham on the cast list, then you definitely have to sit down to watch the 2021 action crime thriller "Wrath of Man". This movie was through the roof.The title of the movie, though, was something that sort of gave off a biblical vibe, so I personally didn't think it was a title suitable for this particular movie.The storyline, as written by Guy Ritchie, was one that swept me up from the very beginning and took me along on a very exciting thrill ride. And I do like the fact that the movie wasn't all that linear and predictable. Writer and director Guy Ritchie managed to come up with something that is every bit as much action packed as it is intense. And that made for a very enjoyable movie."Wrath of Man" has a rather impressive cast ensemble, with the likes of Jason Statham, Holt McCallany, Josh Hartnett, Jeffrey Donovan, Scott Eastwood and Andy Garcia, along with others that were also nicely cast. I must say that Jason Statham was really good in this movie. But I was very thrilled with the performance that Scott Eastwood put on, he was just phenomenal in "Wrath of Man".And the character gallery in "Wrath of Man" was quite well written, and there were some very interesting and nicely detailed characters throughout the movie.This movie provided me with genuine entertainment from the very beginning and up to the very end. So this is indeed a movie that I can - and will - warmly recommend you sit down to watch, should you find yourself presented with the opportunity to do so.My rating of "Wrath of Man" lands on a well-deserved seven out of ten stars."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11083552/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," Best of both Statham and Ritchie ","Though both don't give here an usual performance, if you compare with what they did before. Nothing at all. This looks more like a Walter Hill's film than a Ritchie's one. In the style, it is far far closer to EXTREME PREJUDICE than to SNATCH, in terms of narrative grammar. Definitely. At first, I was sooo scared when they talked about a remake of Nicolas Boukrief's LE CONVOYEUR, so scared...Of course it is different, but maybe even better, and I would have never bet a dime on it. So, what a surprise, in this topic, very unusual, where you deal with several groups, several points of views, where Statham, for once since CRAZY JOE, doesn't play Statham, where you have no good vs evil men, everyone is more or less rotten, and no romance either. Yes, it is a damn good remake, I am nearly ashamed to have been angry about this remake before seeing it; but LE CONVOYEUR is an iconic movie for me. The military robbers group is very well shown, with their families, birthday party, with wives and kids, so we feel empathy for themn though they are the Statham's enemies. That's precisely what I love. Yes, yes yes, tha's the first Guy Ritchie film that I love, and unfortunately maybe the last. A terrific crime flick. A lost gem from Australia and made in 1979, MONEY MOVERS, offers also a very close topic, with also a bloody climax taking place in a security complex facility."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11083552/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," Top-Notch Action Remake of the French Original ","British writer & director Guy Ritchie ranks as one of the undisputed masters of crime movies, and "Wrath of Man" lives up to his reputation both for its violent R-rated bloodbaths and its stoic action star Jason Statham. Statham reminds me of tough guy superstar Charles Bronson with his Neanderthal looks and his ripped physique. This gritty armored car robbery & revenge caper marks the fourth time Ritchie and Statham have collaborated since "Revolver" (2005), "Snatch" (2000), and "Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels" (1998). Unlike Martin Scorsese, our own Oscar-winning cinematic godfather of crime, who specializes in mob movies, Ritchie displays greater range and versatility. Along with his contemporary brass knuckled thrillers, like "RocknRolla" (2008) with Gerard Butler and the Matthew McConaughey marihuana melodrama "The Gentlemen" (2018), Ritchie has no problem rotating between the past, with his two Robert Downey, Jr., "Sherlock Holmes" whodunits, and the present, with his big-screen adaptation of "The Man from U. N. C. L. E." (2015). Not only does "Wrath of Man" differ because it is set on our side of the Atlantic, but it also abstains from comic antics. Composer Christopher Benstead punctuates the bullet-blasting skirmishes with an ominous orchestral score. Meantime, Statham is never less than serious, and Ritchie's nimble direction covers the basics and integrates flashbacks into the narrative. He surrounds Statham with a seasoned ensemble cast featuring Holt McCallany, Josh Hartnett, Jeffrey Donovan, and Scott Eastwood. Incidentally, "Wrath of Man" is a remake of the 2004 French thriller "Le Convoyeur," aka "Cash Truck." "Cash Truck" relied more on subtlety rather than slaughter.You can feel the firm hand of writer & director Guy Ritchie controlling every scene and performance. A slam-bang opening gambit lays the groundwork for everything which ensues. Ritchie orchestrates the complex action with a spontaneity the feels like a tire-iron across your knuckles. Rather than indulging in his penchant for visual flair, Ritchie endows the film with a flat, industrial factuality reminiscent of Jack Webb's black & white "Dragnet" (1954), except Ritchie lenses his pyrotechnics in color. As the film unfolds, Ritchie treats the audience as stowaways in an armored car, so we're eavesdropping on the guards as they amass their monetary cargo and chat about coffee. No sooner have they headed out on their next pick-up than the driver jams on his brakes. A safety worker wearing a white hard hat and lime vest flags the armored truck to a halt as a cement mixing truck whips across the street in front of it, blocking all passage. Swiftly, the guards alert their dispatcher that they are under attack. A blow torch blazes through one wall of the armored truck and cuts a hole in it. Stripping away the seared metal, the bandits seize money satchels by the dozen and order the driver and guard at gunpoint to exit the vehicle. Moments later utter chaos shatters tranquility. Confined as we are in the truck peering out through the front windshield, we cannot catch a glimpse of any gunplay. Nevertheless, the crash of gunfire is unmistakable. Later, we learn the guards were gunned down on the spot along with an innocent bystander who was forced to lie prone on the pavement.After this tragic opening scene, "Wrath of Man" gives us our first glimpse of Patrick Hill (Jason Statham), a quiet, solemn fellow who minds his own business. Hill saunters off the street into Fortico, a Los Angeles' armored car company, where he lands a security guard job. Hill's trainer warns him that recruits must score at least 70 percent in every category from driving to shooting. Otherwise, he must start anew again. Later, the movie flashbacks to 'five months previously,' which dominates the middle section of the action, before Ritchie resumes in the present.Patrick Hill listens to his supervisor, Terry (Eddie Marsan of "Atomic Blonde"), as he sits across the desk from him. He maintains a blank expression. He resembles the thinker Rodan, except he doesn't prop his chin on his fist. Nothing phases Patrick. For all we know, ice water streams through his veins rather than warm blood. Later, during one of his first armored car pick-ups, Hill surprises his incredulous colleagues, Bullet (Holt McCallany of "Fight Club") and their driver Dave (Josh Hartnett of "Black Hawk Down") with his sharpshooting skills. Patrick foils a robbery alone as if he were Dirty Harry and kills all six assailants with flawlessly aimed head shots. Predictably, the Fortico owner and Hill's fellow security guards applaud Patrick when he returns from the field. Nevertheless, Hill doesn't let this praise interfere with his single-minded objective. He has embarked on a bloody crusade, and he is obsessed with achieving his objective no matter what the cost. Basically, Patrick wants to find closure in the face of a heartbreaking tragedy. Divulging further details about the complex plot and the repercussions that occur would spoil the big surprise.Not surprisingly, comparisons are inevitable between "Wrath of Man" and director Christian Gudegast's "Den of Thieves" (2018), toplining Gerard Butler and co-starring Pablo Schreiber. Actually, the two movies share a lot in common, though "Wrath of Man" surpasses "Den of Thieves" only by a couple of hair-triggers. If you haven't seen "Den of Thieves," you've missed a treat. Butler is convincing as a loose cannon L. A. County Sheriff's Department Detective who hounds an elite crew of armored car outlaws. Like the guys in "Den of Thieves," the armored car outlaws plan their hold-ups with the surgical exactitude. They have surveilled everything of interest before they launch strike. In "Wrath of Man," the villains are brothers in their arms who served together in the same Army unit in Afghanistan. Some are just hopelessly bored with their uneventful lives, while others see crime as an avenue to lessen boredom. The ultimate surprise lurks within Patrick's inscrutable character, and it is Patrick's backstory as an 'apparent' hero that may catch audiences' off guard."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11083552/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Ritchie playing it (mostly) straight ","Greetings again from the darkness. Cinematic Alert: Guy Ritchie has gone straight! That's right, the filmmaker we've come to bank on for dynamic action, creative editing, and clever, rapid-fire dialogue laced with dark humor and outright hilarious, offbeat moments, has delivered a straightforward, by-the-book revenge-crime thriller. Of course, despite it being about as good as anything else in the genre, we just can't help but feel a little (and maybe a lot) disappointed that Ritchie has shifted his approach and left us wondering why. After all, he's the genius behind THE GENTLEMEN (2019), SHERLOCK HOLMES: A GAME OF SHADOWS (2011), and SHERLOCK HOLMES (2009), as well as his brilliant first two films: LOCK, STOCK, AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS (1998) and SNATCH (2000).The film opens with an armored vehicle heist that ends in gunfire. This heist and the crew of criminals are the key to the story, and Ritchie utilizes his non-linear, multiple perspective story-telling technique to fill in the gaps for us and provide context to everything else that unfolds. Needless to say, there's more to this heist than what we initially witness. Jumping ahead a few months, the next thing we see is Jason Statham as the mysterious "H" joining Fortico, the cash truck/armored vehicle company victimized in that early sequence. H is clearly wound tightly and not great at making friends ... at least until his heroics thwart another attempted robbery and saves the lives of co-workers Bullet (Holt McCallany) and Boy Sweat Dave (Josh Hartnett).H's motivation is slowly revealed, as is the fact that he's not such an outstanding citizen himself. However, it's clear his mission of revenge is the most important thing in his life, and he'll stop at nothing to get the person he's after. His target is part of a criminal team of former military buddies that include Jackson (Jeffrey Donovan), Ian (Scott Eastwood), Brad (Deobia Oparei), and Sam (Raul Castillo), who want nothing more than one huge score so they can walk away and enjoy life. Other key members of Fortico's staff are played by Niahm Algar, Eddie Marsan, and Rob Delaney. H's contacts are played by Lyne Renee, Darrell D'Silva, and Andy Garcia, while singer Post Malone (billed as Austin Post) makes an appearance as a robber.Filmmaker Ritchie is working with many of his regular collaborators. He co-wrote the screenplay with Marn Davies and Ivan Atkinson, and it's based on the 2004 French movie, LE CONVOYEUR ("Cash Truck") by Nicolas Boukhrief, Eric Besnard. Others from his usual team include cinematographer Alan Stewart, composer Christopher Benstead, and editor James Herbert. It's not unusual to find Jason Statham bring his action expertise to a Guy Ritchie crime movie, but Statham really plays it straight here as he sets out to settle a score. The almost non-existent wise-cracking leaves us feeling a bit adrift due to expectations, but the result is a fine, action-packed movie with one excessively long shootout near the end. Ritchie has certainly earned the right to make the movies he wants, but in the words of main character H, "I do bear a grudge." Opens in theaters on Friday May 7, 2021."

Wrath of Man has solid mechanical Guy Richie action sequences. Compared to Snatch and other Guy Richie movie Wrath of Man is average. But like other Guy Richie movies Wrath of Man has several stories intertwined together excellently. There is the story with of Jason's character, and a heist story going together with plot twists with other characters added to the story. The action, climax, mixed with grimy background makes for an alpha male calamity. Worth watching 7 stars."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11083552/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," For a Guy Ritchie movie disappointing, for a Statham movie like usual. ","Guy Ritchie is after Quentin Tarantino and The Coen Brothers one of my favorite directors. With sublime movies like Snatch, Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, and The Gentlemen, he's one of those directors you follow and are curious and excited about when a new movie comes out. But not all his movies are of the same quality. Like Sherlock Holmes for example (which I found mediocre) Wrath of Man is just passable. It's all well directed but the quality is just not there. And it's a movie with Jason Statham, so it speaks for itself what you will get. Statham never laughs, Statham can't be beaten, Statham wants revenge, in short Statham plays the same character every time. A bit like Liam Neeson. I don't say those are bad actors, certainly not, but it's just always the same. Wrath of Man is full of mindless action, a lot of dead people, a lot of questionable scenes (like the heist for example that looked like doomed to fail). I watched the movie trying not to yawn, I was hoping to get those great dialogues Guy Ritchie is known for, but that just never happened. Wrath of Man is just okay to watch once, but that's it, certainly not at the same level as the other movies from Guy Ritchie."

"," Mr. Hill ",""Wrath of Man" had three strong ingredients: a solid central character, plenty of action, and an intricately crafted screenplay.Jason Statham is first-rate in the role the man known as "H," which is short for Mr. Hill. His real name is Mr. Mace, but the names do not figure in the intensity of the action.The best scenes were those involving a fleet of private armored trucks of the Fortico Company. The opening sequence sets the stage for "H" infiltrating the company, landing a job as a security agent, and seeking revenge for the death of his son Dougie.The script effectively doubled back to reveal what happened to Dougie as a bystander during the film's opening scene. The bereaved dad stoically plots his revenge by piecing together clues about the perpetrators. Led by an operative known as "Sarge" and the trigger-happen Jan, the team, of course, is no match for "H."The secondary characters were well-developed, especially the operative named Bullett. The associate of "H" named Kristy could have been fleshed out more completely. But the film succeeded in delivering good location footage around L.

Perfection is reached when there is nothing else to remove."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11083552/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt"," Statham and Ritchie are supreme entertainers, and Wrath is no exception. ",""I'm beginning to think he's a psychopath."So says one of the bad boys in Guy Ritchie's Wrath of Man about super operative, "the limey" H (Jason Statham). Well, you could say the same for the famously taciturn actor, Statham, who is an expert at kickboxing and jiujitsu in real life. Except that in Wrath he uses a gun."The dark horse" H rarely cracks a smile but here brings a slight grin when he kills six robbers while he's on a run to guard cash for an armored car company called Fortico. One of the successful outcomes of this otherwise standard heist film is Ritchie's ability to weave past and present into a coherent narrative about H's secret revenge wish in a super-charged atmosphere of high-end heist with multiple motives.It's interesting to contrast Statham's stoicism with Bob Odenkirk's relatively more animated dad in the recent actioner, Nobody. Both have scores to settle but come at the revenge in different ways. Such is the lucrative world of kick-butt heroes. There is plenty of room for shenanigans that are at the same time absurd and rational.Helpful to underscore the criminal side of this film is Christopher Benstead's suspenseful score, slightly reminiscent of Bernard Hermann's Hitchcock work. Emphasizing the lighter side of the story is the characters' nicknames seemingly out of the comic books: Bullet (Holt McCallany), Boy Sweat Dave (Josh Hartnett), and Hollow Bob (Rocci Williams), and Hot Betty (?).Add a creative filmmaker like Guy Ritchie, who is at home with Sherlock and Statham, and even Madonna. Without the cockney that demands subtitles, his previous actioner, set in LA, with Statham called The Gentlemen shows Ritchie's ability to mix light and dark, like this lightly grim but eventful Wrath of Man."Let the painter paint."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11083552/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," A moody man in a moody movie. ","Guy Ritchie's latest, a remake of 'Cash Truck (2004), focuses on a mysterious armoured vehicle driver who displays lethal proficiency whenever a truck he's in is targeted by armed robbers. The plot plays out in chapters, moving back and forth throughout time to reveal different layers to the characters and situation. It's a decent idea but it's executed a little poorly; Statham, the man we all came to see, sort of disappears for a large chunk of the 'Wrath Of Man (2021)', despite retaining protagonist status. Having said that, the flick does get better as it goes along and its weakest aspect is definitely its first, seemingly most straightforward segment. That's because it's basically just a bunch of guys making crude homophobic and sexist remarks as they go about their day job. Sure, there are one or two decent action sequences, but even these don't make up for just how monotonous it all is. It doesn't help that Statham is just playing a moody man in a moody movie, without a hint of the sort of self-awareness that makes his overly 'macho' aura work in other productions. It really is just a bit boring, and its perpetuation of the type of toxic masculinity that went out of fashion years ago (which continues throughout its run-time) actually makes it feel old-fashioned in the worst possible way. When its narrative starts to get a bit more involved, it does become a bit more engaging. It tries to develop its side characters enough so that you care when some of them inevitably die, which is appreciated even if it doesn't quite work. The action in the latter half of the picture is more compelling than that in its first and the filmmaking, in general, is on point throughout. Sadly, its revenge element doesn't have the impact it should because the person getting revenge hasn't been developed as a character for quite some time (so, even though he's physically there during the finale, he lacks any semblance of presence). That's the problem with the whole affair, really: it lacks impact. Even at its best, it's just the sort of thing that unfolds in front of you and immediately slips from your mind. It's a self-serious slog for much of its run-time. Even though it has its more successful moments, I wouldn't really recommend it. 5/10."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11083552/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt"," Guy Ritchie & Jason Statham's Finest Film In Years ","Intense, captivating & bolstered by a tough-as-nails showcase from Jason Statham, Wrath of Man is a riveting action-thriller featuring top-grade execution in all aspects and is a marvellous piece of genre filmmaking through n through. Gripping from the get go and unyielding in its intensity from start to finish, the film is a hard-hitting, no-nonsense delight that delivers the goods, and then some.Co-written, produced & directed by Guy Ritchie (Locks, Snatch & The Gentlemen), the premise is simple & familiar and the execution brims with director's trademarks yet it looks & feels surprisingly different from his body of work but in an invigorating way. Ritchie's mature & serious approach here helps sustain the tension & mystery with ease, and it is further elevated by its brooding atmosphere & terrific score.The plot takes its time to reveal itself and the mysteriousness of the lead character is what keeps things intriguing until then. There are multiple storylines as expected but they all tie up to deliver a fitting & satisfying finale. The violence is ruthless and the bare-knuckled brutality leaves its bruises. Yet it is the excellent cast that stands out best, with Jason Statham delivering his finest performance in years and Scott Eastwood impressing with a menacing input.Overall, Wrath of Man is a solidly crafted, expertly executed & strongly acted genre offering that strips out all it can do without to give its viewers a thrill ride that sustains their interest with effortless ease. It's as simple & straightforward as it gets yet there is a style, suave & sophistication to it that makes it stand out. In short, the 4th collaboration between Ritchie & Statham presents both men in prime form, and is one of their career-best works, both together & individually. Highly recommended."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11083552/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," Another Ritchie Gem ","I've always liked a Guy Ritchie film, and this one certainly doesn't disappoint. In fact it seems as if he gets more traction if he makes a film that isn't necessarily based on well known characters (considering that King Arthur really didn't go down all that well), though even if he does make a film that flops, he always manages to pick himself up again and make something different. In fact, he seems to be able to survives flops that would be career ending for some directors.Anyway, this film is set in Los Angeles and is basically about this guy that becomes a security guard in a cash truck. At first he seems to just fit the bill, that is until the truck that he is in is held up by some gangsters, and he suddenly shows his true colours. So, who is this guy? Well, we are given a bit of a look in since the film does jump about, building up the story bit by bit, but we never actually find out what occupation that he used to be in (though there are some suspicions).While the story behind the film is pretty well known, I personally don't want to give too much away, since going into this film with only the knowledge that Jason Statham stars in it, and Guy Ritchie directed it, is basically all we really need to know. Knowing nothing else actually adds to the enjoyment of the film, not that it twists and turns, but rather it reveals things in a peacemeal way that brings you to the point where pretty much everything comes clear at the end.I have to admit that I really do like these non-linear films, especially when they are done right, and Guy Ritchie is definitely knows how to do this, and do this well. Like some of his other films, it is episodic, which is why the film gets away with being non-linear, but it also means that the background is slowly released until the big finale.This is basically a heist movie, something that Ritchie seems to be able to do quite well. Sure, some of his other ones have fallen rather flat, but as far as I'm concerned, when Ritchie is the brains behind the entire show, then you are in for one hell of a ride, and I have to admit this this film is definitely one hell of a ride."

When that happened she was sent to the city to be raised by her aunt and granddad, a big-time politician. However being too precocious for the city life at about 11 or 12 she and her aunt travel by train to reunite with her dad. Along the way the girl sees a family of wild horses running alongside and behind the train.Later in the rustic town the girl is reunited with the horses as thieves try to capture them. With a lot of patience and persistence the girl finally gets the one horse, she names it Spirit, to accept her. From there they get involved in unbelievable adventures along with two other young girls and their horses. In the end they have to go on an unauthorized adventure to help capture the crooks.The animation is very pleasant and the voice acting appropriate. A nicely enjoyable lightweight animated movie. I don't understand the several very harsh reviews, it is just a pleasant movie.At home on DVD from my public library, my wife was on the golf course experiencing her own unique adventure."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11084896/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," the Spirit franchise continues ","Greetings again from the darkness. Any kids that watched Dreamworks' original SPIRIT: STALLION OF THE CIMARRON (2002) are now at least in their mid-20s and many likely have kids of their own. That original film featured old school animation, and provides a nice comparison for today's computerized "drawing". However, from a story and character perspective this is less a sequel to that film, and more a spinoff of the original Netflix series, of which there have been more than 50 episodes.Lucky Prescott (voiced by Isabela Merced, Dora in DORA AND THE LOST CITY OF GOLD, 2019) is a rambunctious youngster being attended to by her Aunt Cora (Oscar winner Julianne Moore) at the home of Lucky's wealthy and now candidate-for-Governor grandfather. With no time for her shenanigans, grandpa ships off Lucky and Cora to be reunited with Lucky's father, Jim Prescott (Jake Gyllenhaal). The two haven't seen each other since Lucky's mother died tragically ten years ago. On the train ride to Miradero, Lucky has a connection with a beautiful wild stallion she names Spirit. The two share a bond of wildness and independence, though soon enough Spirit is being held captive by mean-spirited horse wranglers.Lucky and her father have an awkward reunion as he tries to keep her safe, unwilling to admit the free-spirited nature she shares with her mother, who once rode with the Los Caballeros, a local trick-riding team. Her mother's clothes, boots, and posters open Lucky's eyes to a world that feels like home. She befriends not just Spirit, but also a couple of local girls, Pru (Marsai Martin) and Abigail (Mckenna Grace), who are drawn to Lucky's energy, but also recognize the danger she's in going up against the evil wrangler (Walton Goggins).What follows is an adventure with terrific visuals and enough action to keep the three and five year olds that I watched the film with glued to the screen. Heck Mountain and the Ridge of Regret seemed to be especially exciting for them, and I personally got a kick out of the importance of math (a word problem) in keeping Lucky on track. The film clocks in under 90 minutes, which is just right for most kids. The songs (Taylor Swift sings the trailer song) didn't seem to make much impression, but the kid characters did. From a grown-up perspective, it's hard to miss the fact that the adult males aren't the best role models, and even Abigail's young brother Snips (Lucian Perez) spends most of his time wreaking mischievous trouble. However, the lack of other political messages was a relief, and female empowerment in youngsters is always a welcome story line.The film is co-directed by Elaine Bogan and Ennio Torreson. Writing credits go to John Fusco (the original Spirit film), Aury Wallington (the TV series) and Kristin Hahn and Katherine Nolfi. The all-star voice cast is a nice complement to the visuals (especially the mountains and clouds), and the message about independence and finding one's own way in life. It should also be noted that the film is rated PG, not G.Opens in theaters on Friday June 4, 2021."

The animation is a beauty in itself, perfectly well voiced by actors Jake Gyllenhaal and Julianne Moore to name a few. Also the horse character Spirit is also good here."

A family friendly adventure with a lot of happiness and adventure will light up the target audience of youths, especially girls who love horses, allowing parents to also have a small escape of fun in seeing them happy. And don't worry, there are little "stressful" moments to throw any curve balls. While simple wholesome fun, the movie does suffer from perhaps being too simple, a tale that is rather boring and predictable and lacking depth to what could have been a more wholesome story. Disney, Illumination, even DreamWorks earlier works, had more balance to the film and allowed all audiences to enjoy the spectacle, where this one is geared, including in design, to the young audience. Though it lacks the soul of the original works, it is still fun if you are looking for a G rated family outing, but this reviewer says you can watch it at home and get the same experience at a fraction of the cost.ScoresAnimation/Adventure/Family: 7.0-7.5 Movie overall: 6.0"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11084896/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Sure to Capture New Audiences, Especially Horse Lovers ","Adventure awaits in Spirit Untamed, the next chapter in the beloved animated Spirit franchise which is sure to capture a new audience of followers. Spirit Untamed is the story of connection between a girl named Lucky (Isabela Merced) and a wild mustang stallion she names Spirit. Lucky is a spirited girl and has difficulty fitting into the traditional life that her family plans for her. Her Aunt Cora (Julianne Moore) takes her away from social pressure for the summer to the frontier town of Miradero to live with her estranged father Jim Prescott (Jake Gyllenhaal). On the train to Miradero she encounters Spirit and his wild herd. The story evolves as both Lucky and Spirit adapt to new circumstances and learn to embrace change as well as rely on the friendship and support of others.Lucky is fortunate to find two steadfast friends in Abigail Stone (Mckenna Grace) and Pru Granger (Marsai Martin) who emulate the connection between a girl and her horse that Lucky desires with Spirit. Both girls teach her about equestrian and human connections. I love the fun-loving and spunky character, Abigail, who brings so much humor to the movie which is offset by the sarcasm of Pru. Together these three girls are unstoppable in their efforts to rescue Spirit and his herd from a group of wranglers that threaten their freedom.Spirit Untamed is from Dreamworks Animation so you know the characters and scenery are going to be depicted flawlessly. I love how this film keeps the feel from the original movie but adds another layer of lush detail under the guidance of Director Elaine Bogan who has a personal connection with horses. My favorite scene is what I call "the tango" between Lucky and Spirit when she is trying to coax him to accept her. The pull of their relationship shows and is enhanced perfectly by the light and playful music composed by Amie Doherty. I really like how the movie incorporates the actors singing with their roles-I love to hear Isabela Merced's beautiful voice and even Jake Gyllenhall trying to sing badly.The one segment that bothers me is when Lucky first mounts Spirit. The riding is unbelievable for a girl who is just learning and is more akin to a trained circus or stunt rider. Horses are powerful animals, and I hope young viewers will understand that they need guidance around horses and to respect them. I did love the personality that was given to all the horses in Spirit Untamed-each horse had its own lovable character and expressions. Everyone will, of course, love the cuteness overload of the brave baby foal.What really stands out to me among this film's many underyling messages is the theme of letting go and how hard that can be. I don't want to elaborate further, as it would be a spoiler, but there is one great "letting go" scene with Lucky doing the right thing. Friendship and loyalty are also important themes in Spirit Untamed, as Lucky searches for a place where she belongs.I rate Spirit Untamed 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 4 to 12. This movie will be in theaters June 4, 2021, so don't miss this heartwarming story and adventure! By Selene W., KIDS FIRST!"

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11084896/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Sugary sweet and simple ","IN A NUTSHELL: Dreamworks released Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron back in 2002. This film is less a sequel to that movie and more of a spinoff of the Netflix series. In fact, it's the first theatrically released animated film to be based on a Netflix series. While the original movie utilized old-school animation, this one uses modern CGI; however, keep watching during the final credits for that hand-drawn look.The story is about Lucky Prescott, whose life is changed forever when she moves from her home in the city to a small frontier town and befriends a wild mustang named Spirit.THINGS I LIKED: Isabela Merced voices the protagonist, Lucky Prescott. I thought Isabela was totally adorable in Dora And The Lost City Of Gold (4K UHD) I adore Jake Gyllenhaal and will pretty much watch anything he's in because I think he's such an incredibly talented actor. He even sings a little bit in the film. Believe it or not, this is his first animated film ever! It's also his first PG-rated film.It's also the first animated film for Academy Award winner Julianne Moore, and the perennial villain Walton Goggins.Other voice talents include the beautiful Eiza Gonzalez, McKenna Grace, Marsai Martin, and Andre Braugher.The image of the little boy, Snips Stone, riding that donkey was hilarious. He's voiced by Lucian Perez.Have you ever ridden a horse bareback? Not that comfortable!The animation and story are sugary sweet and simple.Some lovely songs in Spanish are sung at the beginning and end of the movie by Amie Doherty. I especially loved the inspiring lyrics "You have everything you need to be fearless" in the song Be Fearless, Fortuna!There's actually a guy in the cast who does the vocals for the horses! His name is Gary A. Hecker.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE: Very predictable There isn't much character development or plot.Ironically, the movie doesn't have quite the spirit as the original Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron movie, but it is still cute.I would have loved to see more of the little boy. Super cute.Lucky Prescott suddenly starts doing Ninja moves with no explanation as to how she could have possibly learned them.TIPS FOR PARENTS: No profanity, unless you count "Heck Mountain" I love that there's a math formula in the story that shows kids how valuable word problems actually are!Young girls, especially, will enjoy it. What young girl doesn't love horses? This movie would be perfect for an 8-year-old girl's slumber party. I begged my dad for a horse when I was about 12 years old. I quickly changed my mind when my dad gave me the opportunity to care for a neighbor's horse for a week while she was out of town. Smart dad.There is some Spanish is spoken without subtitles. You won't miss anything, really. It's just to give the movie a Latin flair, as the film takes place in probably Texas or Arizona a hundred years or so ago. The family is named after a city in Arizona: Prescott.You can see my full review on my Movie Review Mom YouTube channel!"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11084896/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","1"," Not near as good as original ","This movie was not near as good as the original. It dragged the whole time. No parents or kids laughed at all. Don't waste your time. I grew up with the original film so I was hyped for this and this was one of the worst movies I have seen in years. Don't waste your time and money with this flop. This is probably the biggest disappointment I have seen in a long time. I did not hear anyone laughing or crying why because it stunk that's why. I bet by the end of this year this film will be forgotten.I really wanted to like it but it was not possible. Jake Gyellenhaal was probably the only part of this film that was fine, but this is a film for kids and when the kids are running around the theater instead of watching the actual movie there is something wrong. The film does not keep its target audience entertained enough.Also the supporting characters were super dull and boring and half way irritating. Here is the thing about this movie it also had nothing to even do with Spirit they just used his name for an off brand piece of s**tFinal score 0/10."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11084896/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," Best animated movie ever ","There's no way this is only a 5. Somebody must have a personal problem or be jealous because this movie was way better than a 5. I liked this better than Coco or the new Boss Baby. The story just flows & it was over too quick. I wanted more! It's about a teenage girl who goes home to the country to live with her father. Her mother was a famos rodeo star who died in a freak accident during her act riding a horse. Her father was so sick with grief he couldn't handle raising her by himself alone. So she has been raised by her uncle since she was a baby. But now she's going to live with her father who she doesn't know. Immediately she is pulled to the local rodeo & the horses. Rodeo people recognize her saying she looks just like her mother. She loves watching the horses & feeding them apples. One day some bad rustlers catch a herd of wild horses & they start mistreating them in the ring. She can't stand watching it and decides to rescue them. She lets them out of their pen to go back to being free. But the next day the bad guys follow her & she leads them right to the herd. They round them up & put them on a train. She runs back & tells her two rodeo girlfriends about it. They tell her that rustlers take wild horses by train to a boat. She asks them to help her rescue the horses off the train before it gets to the boat. The adventure her & the two rodeo girls go on to rescue the horses from the train is spectacular. I really really loved this movie. Imagine colorful desert scenery, think Utah rock formations, three girls on horseback camping, sleeping outside, roasting marshmallows over a campfire fire & a train that goes by gorgeous wild horses running free & it stops at a small town with a rodeo. A fun friendship between three teenage girls riding horses together in the beautiful country. They go on a mission to save the herd of wild horses stuck on the train."

","I liked the first Spirit movie, it has a unique story, beautiful animation and memorable characters, a very underrated DreamWorks film I must say, but who asked for a 3D animated movie?, even if it's related the show, it came out in the UK yesterday and I gave it a watch and... yeah..., it was boring.., super bland and forgettable...The film has nothing new or original, it's the same old saving the animals from villain with a parent who won't listen and main character want to explore instead of following family tradition, it's predictable to the point that you can guess within the first few minutes and you can connect the dots, it's exactly that, it's not a funny movie at all, I didn't smile once or anything, it's that rubbish, the characters are designed blandly and don't stand out, they are quite boring with no personality and memorable lines, even the voice acting feels phoned in and the cast sound tired along with a basic bland and forgettable animation that has nothing worth remembering from DreamWorks, also I was bored incase you couldn't tell...However there was a couple of things I can say positively, even though it's not funny at all, I did laugh once and I liked the nice bonding of Lucky & Spirit, that was okay, despite how basic and bland It looks, the animation is legit pretty to look at and Spirit looks good in 3D animation, so at least it's visually pleasant at best, along with decent voicing acting with Jake Gyllenhaal and Walton Goggins giving out their best performance here.But yeah, I didn't like it, not the worst DreamWorks film but it's close, so I even need to say?, boring story, tiresome acting, forgettable animation and just dumb characters, this film might be fine for kids but boy is it boring, even with pretty animation and a okay bonding scene, it's still not a good film, far from it, almost as bad as Shark Tale, but at least it's not scary, but yeah don't waste your time on this, stick to the 2002 movie or the show if it's any good but I haven't seen it so I won't get around to watching it, but yeah definitely one of the worst DreamWorks films to date and one of the worst films of this year and one I will instantly forget quickly.Spirit: Untamed gets a 3.9/10."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11091504/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," A horror film with substance ","I've been a fan of genres films since I was a kid; I grew up watching horror and thrillers like Scream, Candyman, Silence of the lambs, Dusk till dawn, and so many others. I'm a fan of slashers and gore, but also really enjoy when a film lets me in on the characters backstory. I think this is one of the reason The Welder resonated with me. It wasn't scary in the traditional sense, I wouldn't compare this film to the insidious franchise or Hereditary for example; I feel like those films fall squarely in the horror genre category, The Welder is different. It combines elements of Body horror, thriller, drama, and heck even a pinch of that delicious camp we all loved from the 90s. With those ingredients combined, The Welder really delivers in more ways then one. Firstly, since there is such an intimate cast, Director David Liz and co-writer Manny Delgadillo were able to really develop each character like an onion, with many, many layers. This allowed me to really understand who each character was and why they were doing what they were doing; which in turn helped me understand the film on a deeper level. Another thing I liked about the film was the acting. It was a cast of unknowns, but they were so good. Camila Rodriguez (Eliza) and Roe Dunkley (Roe) really sell their relationship and I really felt for Roe when.... Actually, no spoilers here, watch the film. Camila is a beautiful, young, and Latina actress who has so much talent she is most certainly not going to remain unnoticed for long. Roe is so good as well, he reminds me of a mix between young Will Smith and John David Washington. Vincent De Paul (Dr. Godwin) plays an amazing villain, who turns out to be more of an anti-hero. Mr. De Paul was excellent, his deep and honest portrayal of Dr. Godwin was moving and expertly executed; you can tell he is a seasoned performer, such a phenomenal actor. Cristian Howard (Don) plays the perfect Igor (Frankenstein reference), with his expertly executed depiction matched with his piercing green eyes he really created a magical mood which I haven't seen in a horror film for a long time. The thing I liked most about the movie is it's message of unity. Although there are scares, blood, sparks, and cut off limbs the overall message is one of togetherness. Like their tagline reads: We're all Red inside. In a way this movie is certainly trying to teach it's viewers a lesson, almost like a warning to society: Sometimes when you try to fix things, you inadvertently makes things worse."

There are a few surprises in the story, but it's still warm and fuzzy and has that predictable "happily ever after" ending that we all look for in these kinds of movies.Ashley Brinkman, Robert Picardo and Al Sapienza are the standouts of this film.

"Plantados" refused to be treated as regular prisoners given they were imprisoned for political reasons.

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11102314/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," The fragility of relationships ","The film slices together three generations of women from one family in a human story about complex relationships, secrets and lies. The story is quite melodramatic, but the delivery is pulled off with a certain touch of restraint and authenticity. This is of course in contrast to the well-known paradigm of the traditional Hindi family drama where even simple stories were portrayed with overstated sentimentality. This is not to say all of it does not exist here, it does, but the film works as an emotional melodrama, which focuses more on the drama part of it, and it's watchable all through. Spoken in several languages and having no songs, the film is very focused around its story and I'm sure many viewers might relate to many parts in it.The narrative style is mostly conversational, which I love and always find engaging, and it heaveily relies on the presence and quality of its actors, on the dialogue and its delivery. Sadly this is exactly why film is not fully realised as far as handling of its important themes goes, such as child abuse and marriage conflict. Being such massive subjects, their presentation feels quite lacking and makes the entire project feel a little shallow sometimes. This is also true, in some ways, of the way the relationship between the older mother and daughter is portrayed. We hardly see balance there. Interestingly, the relationship between the next generation of women is better portrayed despite being given less screentime or importance.Kajol's starry presence in such a film could have threatened the director's quest for low-key simplicity, but it's Kajol after all - a naturally gifted actress whose deep proficiency in the tiny nuances of the human experience has soared above even the limiting constraints of commercial Hindi cinema. Her Anu seems tailor-made for her, considering both her on- and off-screen persona - fiery, intense, brash, and brutally honest, but goodhearted and loving all the same. Okay, she gets to drop many F bombs, which is a little forced, but she captures the highly irritable nature of this woman who always seems on the verge of explosion and, above all, the person beneath the tough exterior. One is left hoping she'd keep experimenting with complex roles.The supporting cast wavers, but even better is Tanvi Azmi, who gives perhaps the film's most affecting and fully convincing performance, which is measured, profound, nuanced, and composed all at the same time. Among the other players, Mithila Palkar seems to do the best of the little she's given, and she's decent although it's a big challenge to act opposite such strong performers as Azmi and Kajol. Even less convincing though is Kunaal Roy Kapur, who is not bad but who just feels very self-conscious playing this self-conscious and moralistic role. Director Renuka Shahane, herself an actress, does her best with this feature despite the restrictive nature of its setting and script. Her film is not great, but it's enjoyable and involving."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11102314/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Decent attempt by debutant director Renuka Shahane ","Tribhanga (Netflix film) review :Noted actor Renuka Shahane's directorial debut called Tribhanga explores multiple relationships through its three main characters transcending generations - grand mom (Tanvi Azmi), mother (Kajol) and her daughter (Mithila Parkar). Packing in the inter-familial conflict with feminism, child abuse, gender bias and whole lot of women centric issues, it appears the debutant director has bitten off more than she can chew.Not that it is a bad effort, on the contrary, Renuka deserves praise for handling certain scenes with the right amount of grace and sensitivity. Like the scenes involving the step dad played by Kanwaljeet Singh (endearing). But somewhere, the screenplay appears hurried up to pack in every element at crisp one and half hours which makes me wonder if it was more suited for an elaborate web series than a film.Expectedly, Kajol is excellent in the main role. The actor clearly rises above the script here and how!! Tanvi Azmi is equally good as her mom who sacrifices a lot to follow her writing passion. Mithila Parkar leaves a mark even in a small role.On the other hand, the male characters appear ill written and totally caricatured. Kunal Roy Kapoor's performance borders on buffoonery and irritates to the hilt. Vaibhav Tatwawaadi, playing Kajols brother, isnt able to justify his character at all. The problem lies in the writing which is obviously tilted towards the female cast at the cost of crucial male characters. Indeed, a balance was needed here to make the resultant conflicts more identifiable and relatable.Another drawback is the needless cussing done by Kajol's character. Sorry but all those F words only act as a distraction.All said and seen, even with all its plus and minus, Tribhanga is one of the better films I caught in recent times on Netflix. Forget the AKs and Dolly Kittys out there, you can watch Tribhanga if you have subscribed to that OTT app. A one time watch, yes!!Regards, Sumeet Nadkarni."

","Netflix's brand-new incentive "Tribhanga" commits all its exertions to exhibit a ruptured relationship between a Mother & a Daughter and their conclusive reconciliation. But due to the leaden Screenplay & an ineffectual Writing; the narrative falls short in establishing prominence! Seeing such a commanding starcast, it got me habitually excited. For me, there's nothing better than a well executed Drama; especially which deals in Family Values & Quintessential Accords. And believe me, this had every fundamental constituent to make something akin to my liking. Yet the whole shebang collapsed!Reason? most of the calls they made regarding its narration. With the gleeful exception of its technical showing! The emotions never really flourished. Dialogues doesn't always land; incorporating profanity without any proper reason. There were endless opportunities to mold ensembled characters in a way, that we as audience can make empathetic connections. Unfortunately the writer had other ideas. Renuka Shahane, who's also the director here; failed to take advantage of a promising premise and a set of incredible talents in her helm.Kajol, Tanvi Azmi, Mithila Palkar. They don't need any introduction, nor there is any skepticism regarding their capabilities as actors. Yet, sorry to say; everyone's performances here are strictly average. And guess what!? It's not even their fault! They shine only momentarily at times, therefore not been able to leave a lasting impression."

Anu arrives with her daughter Masha (Mithila Palkar) and brother Robindro (Vaibhav Tatwawaadi), rather nonchalantly, as she is not really emotionally connected to her mother, to the surprise of Milan (Kunal Roy Kapoor), who is penning Nayan's autobiography.Tribhanga is a glimpse into the past of the three women across three generations, and how their respective choices of living their lives influenced and shaped that of the next generations. It's a domino effect in which Anu who suffered the effects of Nayan's choices, ensured Masha's childhood remained protected, and Masha in turn, rejoicing to live amid a large, joint family even at the expense of her individual freedom and values.The subject is sensitive and has been handled with flourish by director Renuka Shahane. Kajol obviously gets the lion's share of screen time and is the central character - she delivers a strong performance that on a few occasions comes out as rather loud and over the top. Tanvi Azmi and Mithila Palkar have comparatively smaller roles, but don't fail to create a deep impact by holding their ground. Kunal Roy Kapoor is delightful as the outsider who connects the three women and helps reestablish mutual respect and appreciation. Tribhanga is a remarkable effort to showcase family values in modern times, and would have been even better if the events were better connected and the characters of Nayan and Masha were given more screen space. Baba Azmi's cinematography is par excellence."

After the last year thappad, this year tribhanga did the trick.The story is about 2 mothers and one mother going to be. How each of them troubles in their life to keep their relationships. How a child is restricted by parents for life choices and all their life depend on others choices.What movie wants to emphasis is what our childhood experience affect the rest of the life. And it is advising the audience to think about your children in different aspect and asking us to do not let your child suffer from your selfish choices.Once again thribhanga tries to break the traditional woman concept in asian society.Kajol did her best and and writer has given her right dialogs which brings the movie to top.She is beautiful as ever and her costumes are matching to the scene.

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11102314/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Strained but beautiful. - Tribhanga. ","Refreshing to eye opener.The title is derived from an indian classical dance pose from Odissi, which is described as imperfect but beautiful quite like the lives of the three women. Tale of 3 mother's, who are also daughter and daughter-in-law. Weird - sexy and classy.The lady with a million dollar smile - Renuka Shane has written and directed such a composite film feels like art.Kajol as Anuradha 'Anu' Apte is so stunning to watch, I and my wife were discussing how Kajol's acting seems so natural and she's naturally loud which makes it beautiful to watch her act. Tanvi Azmi as Nayantara 'Nayan' Apte seems so subtle and layered character. Mithila Palkar as Masha has a tiny but important role, she's the third arc of Tribhanga and I felt she should have been given enough space and time. Kunaal Roy Kapur as Milan is such a cutie and always nice to watch. His ability to take up gaalis is brilliant. Vaibhav Tatwawaadi as Robindro is calm and soothing. Manav Gohil as Raghav definitely needed more character. Kanwaljeet Singh as Bhaskar Raina is seen as a nice guy but with lack of time and depth. But overall a great ensemble of wonderful actors.I like the way the inegrate Marathi and Hindi, a very different approach. Heart warming and soulful at times, irritating and calming at times. Though cuss words by Kajol seems too much, her trauma is also much. Tribhanga has relationships, awkardness, weirdly real and thought provoking. It has feminism at it's core still doesn't proclaim anything. To be honest Marathi movies are superbly brilliant and calming and Tribhanga is a marathified version of a Hindi cinema. Crossing makes it beautiful.A must watch on Netflix."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11102314/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," Tanvi Azmi acts beautifully but the movie is quite disappointing. ","After watching the trailer, one would have expected an emotionally stimulating experience while watching the film, but instead all that we get is a loud Kajol in almost every single frame. She just keeps shouting and shouting and shouting, and that just doesn't make for an enjoyable experience. The other three leading women on the other hand have given very grounded and believable performances. Shweta Mehendale as the young Nayantara, Tanvi Azmi as old Nayantara and Mithali Palkar as Masha are much more likeable and easier to watch. I don't understand why Anuradha's (Kajol) character was written like this, it's difficult to even sit through the scenes where a character overacts, especially the way Anuradha did. This almost felt like a 'Main Prem Ki Dewani Hoon' or 'Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gham' kind of performance. Also, why was Milan, played by Kunaal Kapoor, using such heavy words while talking ? Nobody talks like that in real life, and it didn't even feel natural, it seemed as if he was forcing himself to talk like that.The movie was expected to be the story of three women belonging to three different generations, which it was indeed, but the maximum screen time was dedicated to Kajol's character, and she kept swearing and screaming at the top of her lungs in almost every single scene. Mithila Palkar's performance almost felt like an extended guest appearance.Not everything is bad or annoying in this film though. The scene involving Mithila Palkar and her grandparents is bound to touch your heart and make you emotional. Tanvi Azmi is a gem of an actress, and she has delivered her act very beautifully here as well. There are quite a few scenes in which Kajol acts normally, and they are all wonderful, I just wish she had acted like that in the entire film.This movie is not about heroic personalities, instead it narrates a story about three flawed women, who lived their life on their own terms and made choices that they felt were the right ones to make. It's always a risk to make a film like this, because we as an audience always find it difficult to like such characters, we are more accustomed to watching heroes or grey characters with redeemable qualities.Although, this isn't the first time a story like this has been told, it's not much of a problem really, at least there was a story, but the way it was told was definitely disappointing. Maybe the short duration of the film deterred the writer and director from adding more depth to the film.Unfortunately this film falls in the sad/depressing category of films, which doesn't really find a lot of takers, especially in times like these where our mind is preoccupied with stress and apprehensions. Most of us look for entertaining or uplifting content."

Like why would Kajol's character who has been brought up in that environment use words like Jhantu or Gandu ? Doesn't make any sense ? Is it supposed to be empowerment or funny. Ends up being just cringe.Story was strained, as much as the relationships portrayed within the film.

","Granted, I was lured in to watching the 2021 movie "The Nest" (aka "The Bewailing") given the movie's rather interesting cover/poster, and also because it was a horror movie that I hadn't already seen.But "The Nest" from writer Jennifer Trudrung and director James Suttles just proved to be a very generic and mundane foray into the creepy crawlers subgenre of the horror genre. Yeah, "The Nest" doesn't really deliver much of anything, aside from a whole lot of nothing happening. And you need to venture about 1 hour and 12 minutes into the movie before it starts becoming mildly interesting, but by that time it was just too little, too late.Sure, the concept idea behind "The Nest" is interesting, and there definitely is potential for something truly entertaining and disturbing here. But director James Suttles only managed to deliver a sub-par movie here.While I managed to sit through the entire ordeal, I must admit that I was tempted to get up and walk out on it a couple of times along the way. Why? Well, simply because not enough of anything worthwhile was happening throughout the majority of the movie. And by the time director James Suttles opted to amp up the events, then it was just simply too late.The acting in the movie was adequate, though it was clear that the actors and actresses were struggling with a sub-par script and storyline. And it didn't really help the movie much that the characters were mostly bland and lacking in-depth personalities.Sure, they had an okay ensemble of actors and actresses on the cast list here, with even Dee Wallace being here. However, even someone as iconic as her could do only so little to salvage the movie.The movie's title, "The Nest", sort of is very unfitting for the movie. I would assume that there would have been additional bugs in order for it to be a nest. And especially so since the movie's cover portrayed a heap of insects. But instead I found myself treated to seeing a single insect, and it only popped up at 72 minutes into the ordeal. And it wasn't even worth the wait, very anti-climatic.It should be said though that the visuals with the teddy bear with the enlarged eyes definitely worked well. Because that teddy bear certainly had something insect-like going on, and I liked that. And the effects when it opened up its belly to unleash the insect inside, definitely also looked good, especially with the good and the sticky residue.For a horror movie then "The Nest" just failed to be an outstanding, much less being an overly memorable and entertaining horror movie. It simply proved too boring and uneventful, and the movie will just simply slip away into the mists of oblivion without having left any type of lasting impression on me.I was rather disappointed with this movie, especially since I was looking forward to seeing it, given the movie's cover and the fact that Dee Wallace was in it.I am rating "The Nest" a rather generous four out of ten stars."

Now, not only is Meg overly attracted to her bear, but their family friend Marisa (Dee Wallace!) and Jack are overly attached to Meg, creating this strange circle of weirdness, all while the painkillers Beth needs to get past a brutal fall down the steps give her nightmarish visions of parasitic creatures that are using her family for sustenance.So yeah - if you watch one movie about an otherwordly bug that lives inside a teddy bear named Ricky that possesses a young girl and makes her drug-addicted mother doubt reality - actually there's no other movie like that. The last scene of this made me laugh at its utter audacity and I consider that a triumph."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11105376/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," The Nesting. ","Taking a look at the line-up for the May Bank Holiday GRIMM Film Festival line-up,I was intrigued to see by the rather ghoulish poster for a title,which led to me getting into the nest.View on the film:Revealing in a discussion after the stream/screening that the script originally started as two separate plot threads,which were later edited together to become one host, the first non-short film screenplay by Jennifer Trudrung crunches creepy-crawly body-snatching Horror, with a fragile psychological Thriller motherly bond between Beth (played with a great walking on eggshells anxiety by Sarah Navratil) and her increasingly disconnected young daughter.Taking pills for her psychosis and to block out the horrors Beth assumes she is imagining, Trudrung chillingly links the monstrous invader to the opioid crisis,with the family turning into a dead-eyed drugged-up state,and the unanswered question,on if Beth's psychosis is hereditary to her daughter.As the infestation digs deeper into the family, director James Suttles reunites with cinematographer Greg Hudgins and nests the family in icy panning shots reflecting the draining of colour from the lives inside the house. Giving Beth a hazy glimmer of hope with distorted close-ups that reel in a Thriller tension, Suttles gloriously snaps all hope away with a drenched in black gloomy ending which keeps the family in the nest."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11105376/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," They Tried ","This movie was a low budget that really tried to be likeable but failed terribly. I think the idea was on point and I was truly creeped out. But the actors and the way it was exacted was not believable.I was hopeful for the movie with the introduction of the therapist named Taylor, online they called him Ashe, but the beginning said they fired Ashe and got Tylor so a bit of confusion there. Anyways, Drez Ryan brought some new energy to the movie and I had hope it would have stay till the end. This movie just took way to long to get to the point, I wished the thing in the bear would hurry up and do whatever it was they were waiting for him to do!That is not good when you want a movie to be rushed. I defiantly would not watch this with kids around, the one sex scene was hard to watch. Overall, this was just not special or interesting to devote the time into watching, that is my honest opinion. Like always, you should be your own judge. But I know there are much better new movie out there then this!"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11105376/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","2"," Best to just skip this one ","Now this movie isn't the worst out there. Nothing is done horribly wrong, even acting is somewhat acceptable but not good by any means. The huge issue this movie has, is that is deadly boring. Everything happens slowly and blandly. And you just don't care what happens to these people, they are so generic."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11105376/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," Only $89,000? Not bad for low budget horror, but.... ","The acting is atrocious. Nobody can act, not even the old lady. The school counselors scripted dialog seems like it was written by an actual child psychologist.... some of the words he says to the kid is ridiculous. The set design, cinematography, and sound design are all well done. Luckily the budget couldn't afford CGI, so what little practical effects are done well. But the acting is atrocious."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11105376/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","2"," Written by body-snatching insects... ","...and clearly not by humans who have ever taken part in doing human things. I mean, who puts their child in therapy because she's 'making up' her stomach aches before taking her to a doctor?The dialogue is painfully cliched, stilted, and just plain bad. The actors (even Dee Wallace) can't do anything to lift it up out of the garbage. While the director clearly thinks he's doing sublime work, too many of the shots are boring and lack the tension that was clearly the aim. There's a spoiler scene in the opening that pretty much takes away all potential build-up to creepiness, and ruins what could have been an all-right slow burn reveal.Between the bad acting and the worse dialogue, I had no one that I could sympathize with. The characters were pretty unlikeable, whether they were body snatched or not.And it was boring. The movie took forever, and not in any type of good way. If what another reviewer said is true that this is two separate stories that were edited together, it really shows. And it manages to do neither of them well. Or even good."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11105376/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Not too shabby ","Definitely had the creep factor on high and I couldn't wait for the bug reveal after being teased constantly with the teddy bear. Other than that there's not much to say, the actors did well and the story was intriguing but the movie won't make your evening or stick with you for long."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11105376/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Stays Engaging ","When comparing this relative to other recent media, it scores highly.The plot stays engaging, the actors aren't annoying (even the kid actors do a good job) and you cannot tell which way the ending will finally goThis is worth a watch."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11105376/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," If this is what they did with a small budget, I would love to see what else this team could do ","Not to be confused with The Nest that came out in 2020 or the one from 2019 or the television series of the same name, THIS Nest is a horror movie made on a small budget, but one that manages to deliver on the kind of ick factor and body horror that would make David Cronenberg smile.Starring mostly unknowns and a legit genre staple and Scream Queen in her own right, Dee Wallace (Cujo, The Howling, Critters) this is the kind of horror that plays on those things that make you squirm in your seat. I struggle with trypophobia which simply means irregular patterns or clusters (like a beehive or a rash) triggers me and I have to look away. If this is an issue for you as well, there are scenes here that will definitely set you off but (thankfully?) due to the smaller budget, those scenes only pop up a few times during this ode to body horror. The cast is a small one and consist of mainly three people who play our family unit made up of Mom, Dad and a little girl who is gifted a teddy bear by a weird old man. It turns out the bear has some sort of sentient insect/s living inside it and using the poor child as its host, this parasite starts taking over friends and family members one by one.The Nest starts off a bit shaky with actors Sarah Navratil and Kevin Patrick Murphy as parents Beth and Jack who take some time to settle into their roles making it difficult to see them as a loving couple. Ironically this awkward chemistry works to their benefit as the story progresses and paranoia over whether or not you can trust each other sets in. Dee Wallace is a horror movie goddess who makes everything she's in that much better. She's not on screen a whole bunch but steals every scene she's in, with my favorites being her interactions with Beth. Besides the main family and Wallace's Marissa, the other actors don't get that much screen time but they do what they're supposed to well enough so I guess that's fine.Overall this isn't going to please everyone and as I mentioned before, it's a small budget film with limited locations and a handful of actors. But the practical effects by team Kayla Voytek and Jennifer Yates are very well done and combined with the truly stellar sound design by Aaron Putnam, both will crawl under your skin in the worst way. I also enjoyed the fact this movie manages to be its own original thing while still showing inspiration from classics like Invasion of the Body Snatchers, The Hidden and maybe even a bit of Rosemary's Baby. The themes of motherhood and how difficult it can be as a parent to balance your love for your children and your need to retain your individuality without feeling guilty was well executed and the conclusion was also a ballsy one reminiscent of the more morose horror movies of the 60's and 70's , The Nest will probably be overlooked for more flashy, big budget fare and that's a shame because it's creative writers, directors and artists like these that deserve to be in the spotlight for their work and in doing so, get the big bucks they need to show what they can do to a much larger audience. If you're a horror fan I recommend checking it out because if body horror is your thing, this is a Nest you won't mind visiting.Score 5.5 out of 10."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11105376/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," Surprise! ","I rented this movie out of redbox thinking "yeah okay cool horror movie night" i did not expect it to be so in control and solid and quite frankly, actually kind of scary. Well done, not as over the top as the cover/ title screen would lead you to believe, way more donked up than that. I give it an oh hell yeah and go ahead and make a sequel. Do that thing."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11105376/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","3"," Way too long for what it is ","While it doesn't look or feel like some of the low budget movies usually do, it just goes on way too long. They tried to throw in some unnecessary drama, and dragged on a lot of the rest. 30 minutes easily could have been cut without losing anything. The acting wasn't great but wasn't terrible. Had some creepy/gross parts, but I would not watch it again."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11105376/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","2"," No idea what happened ","To start, the poster image has nothing to do with the plot of this movie. I was so bored watching and waiting to understand what was going on. It's like Case 39 meets Requiem for a Dream, but not even a 5th as good as either (And Case 39 was not a great movie). Are they trying to make a point about addiction? Was it all illusionary? The end made zero sense and was a grotesque scene just to be grotesque. I strongly do not recommend."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11115706/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," Great Movie! ","Finally...Hollywood has a realistic version of what a real mid-western blended family looks like. Director Jon Sherman along with his partner and co-writer Melissa Vogley-Woods bring to life an amazing Rom-Com that explores what it means to create a new family, with all the joys and challenges that come along with it.All families have issues and this family is no different. They have a son who is headed for rehab, a daughter who is gender fluid, and two other daughters who are dealing with being the children of separated parents. Plus there is the added strain on the kids of their parents new romantic partners coming into their lives.The movie also does an incredible job of showing the BDSM Community as it really is...a diverse amalgam of folks from all walks of life who choose to explore and express their sexuality creatively, spiritually, and of course kinkily. This is not a Shades of Grey or Eyes Wide Shut version of BDSM. Amy Hargraves and Joey Slotnick show the humanity and vulnerability of normal people open to discovering new parts of their sexuality with their partners.This film is filled with rawness and humor and most of all realness. I appreciate the story they tell and the way they tell it. Kudos to Jon and Melissa for writing such a wonderful screenplay and a round of applause to the actors who it brought it to life."

I wish they kept the story tighter, more realistic in some parts, as by the end of the movie, reached with many fast forward jumps, i tought the last 2 scenes good and the overall idea good in the aspect of the 2 time lines connection. Great effort if director/writer pretty new at the game. Maybe a shorter and re edited version can raise the movie to watchable level plot and story wise. Cheers."

IT DID NOT NEED TO BE AN HOUR AND 40 MINUTES LONG THOUGH!It oddly looks like a showtime movie, I have the suspicion the director just made this to get Cortney Palm in as many skimpy outfits as possible.

They are both interesting, believable and lovable.The creepy character Chaz Gold played by Oliver Cooper is hilarious , very entertaining, and adds flavor to the film!The extremely talented, effervescent, foxy Patricia Rae, portrays Angela the spiritual awareness extraordinaire with flair and spice. She is the real deal!I absolutely love her! She is exquisitely divine!The cast perpetuate a chilling plot worth watching!In addition , throughout the film Clint Howard as Dr. Ulrich Von Strauss sets an ominous tone with plausible scientific explanations which creates even more fear and trepidation.The gifted writer and skillful director Matteo Ribaudo knows how to grip his audience and keep them on the edge of their seats!The Beyond Paranormal Director uses colorful landscapes, lucid imagery and a frightful narrative to take you on a ride to the other side!This motion picture is horror, sci-fi ,supernatural, gore, thrill, twists and more!Bravo, Mr. Ribaudo!The creative wardrobes for the gorgeous princess Nikki Howard and warrior(s )Anthony Cruz, Ty Q, magnificent!"

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11121664/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Intense family drama is likely to raise the hairs on your arms ",""Blue Bayou" (2021 release; 116 min.) brings the story of Antonio Leblanc. As the movie opens, Antonio is interviewing for a job and turned down. From the interview we learn that he was born in Korea and adopted at a young age by a family in Louisiana. Antonio is married to Kathy, who is highly pregnant with the couple's first child (Kathy has a young daughter Jessie from a prior marriage). Kathy's ex is a New Orleans cop. One day, he and another cop harass Kathy and end up viciously beating and arresting Antonio, who before we understand what is happening is facing deportation to Korea... At this point we are 15 min into the film but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing exprience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this film is a labor of love from leading actor/writer/producer/director Justin Chon. Here he brings a fictional story (loosely based on actual facts) of how an adopted person who has lived in the US for decades still may face deportation, and faster than you may think is possible. What exactly causes this to happen is the crux of the entire film so I'm not going into details about this. The movie benefits enormously from the heartfelt performances of Justin Chon (as Antonio), newcomer Sydney Kowalske as 5 yr. Old Jessie and lst but certainly not least Oscar-winner Alicia Vikander ("The Danish Girl"), pretty much unrecognizable as Kristy (it wasn't until the end credits rolled that I realized it was indeed Vikander). These performances carry the film. That doesn't mean that the film is flawless: the script is at times uneven. And the camera work contains far too many extreme closeups and handheld footage. And yes, the movie does contain the classic title track song, but not by Roy Orbison or by Linda Ronstadt. Instead we hear it covered by... Alicia Vikander! Yes, not only is she a top actress and stunningly beautiful, but she can also sing. Oh yes, she can!"Blue Bayou" premiered at this year's Cannes Film Festival to positive acclaim, and the film opened in select theaters in late September. The Sunday early evening screening where I saw this at my local arthouse theater here in Cincinnati was attended so-so (7 people in total, including myself). Regardless, if you are in the mood for a heavy duty family drama that is likely to raise the hairs on your arms, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater (if you still can), on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11121664/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," TOO MUCH PLOT FOR ONE MOVIE...! ","A large heart on your sleeve domestic drama from this year starring Justin Choi (who also wrote & directed). Choi opens the film trying to get a second job (he's a tattoo artist) since his wife, played by Alicia Vikander (who I think is in the third film I've seen her in, in the last few weeks), is about to have his baby while they're raising her child from her previous marriage (she was married to a cop). He has a checkered past (he's a Korean immigrant who was adopted by shitty parents, has had run-in's w/the law, etc.) & things are looking bleak since he got into it w/the same ex-wife cop & his partner & arrested where he's informed he's primed to be deported even though he's been living in the States since he was three. As the ever increasing, densely plotted narrative marches on (which includes Choi befriending a Vietnamese woman dying of cancer, his inner turmoil in asking his adoptive mother for help, his need to raise money for his attorney, played by Vondie Curtis-Hall, etc.) we are soon inundated by a TV series' season worth of plots that in a 2 hour film gets capsized about an hour in as our Job like protagonist suffers all manner of injustices & obstacles sans floods, locusts & delinquent tax returns.

In fact the deportees virtually all have committed serious crimes -- as did the person on whom this film is loosely based.We had a case in my kids school of a step-father who was getting deported and here was an effort in the school to get parents to write in support of the step father. It turns out he had not one, but two, distribution level felony narcotics offenses, including one with a third felony (pled to misdemeanor) gun offense the year before. They guy was literally a illegal gun totting drug pusher with violent gang affiliation.I am shocked that other reviewers are bringing up DACA. Under Obama's DACA, the case that this story is based on, the guy would be DEPORTED. He amassed a long record of crimes including violent crime and gun crime. To be a felon in possession of a firearm means you have committed TWO feloniesThe fact is that even legal immigrants -- who already awarded citizenship can -- in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the EU-- be deported as well if they commit violent crime. If the character, or the one who it is based on, had in fact been given citizenship, they could still be deported given the violent nature of their criminal conviction."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11121664/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Problematic plot. ","ICE ICE baby...A drama written, directed, produced, and acted by Justin Chon about a Korean immigrant facing deportation.The first hour and a half of this movie was very solid. For the most part I enjoyed the acting, which were raw and strong. The relationship between the main character and his stepdaughter was endearing. There's a subplot of him and a Vietnamese family that was also investing. The drama was solid, and brought up an important theme about another side of immigration and deportation that surprised me.However, like a soccer player with amazing dribbling skill but terrible finishing shot that always miss the goal, the last 20 minutes of this movie became messy and ruined its great buildup. I felt like I just skipped a part of this movie, because some side characters turned sides in a snap. Because of this, the ending lost a lot of the emotional impact.I loved that the script included the Vietnamese into the movie, but then I became perplexed, and honestly a bit annoyed, at how this subplot was meant only as a tool to add to the message. The Vietnamese characters had almost no relevancy to the plot. It was as if Justin forced himself to include the Vietnamese because both the Korean and Vietnamese went through wars that led to mass immigration.Overall, a potentially impactful movie, but ruined by its forcing and questionable plot. 6.5/10."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11121664/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Overly Dramatic, Should've Been Better ",""Listen to him, look at him. He's American."As a Korean-American man raised in the Louisiana bayou works hard to make a life for his family, he must confront the ghosts of his past as he discovers that he could be deported from the only country he has ever called home. Blue Bayou hit some fall festivals, mainly because of its release shortly after them, but there was definite potential in creating a touching story. Justin Chon has worked his way up from playing Eric in Twilight and is now a filmmaker himself with a few films already. This is his most personal yet from what I've been told and I can understand why. It's one of those movies that covers an issue needing attention with stats right before the credits roll. As important of a topic this is, the movie falls into tropes of an overly dramatic feature we've seen in variations. Let me start out by saying a Justin Chon has potential as a filmmaker. The direction may not be spot on and the same goes for the writing, but he has an eye on what he wanted to invoke. The way it's shot is honestly what carries the whole thing. With it being shot on film, there's an automatic home movie feel to it that puts us right in the spot of the characters. And the cinematography is some of the best we've seen this year. The visuals are rich with color and it's warm to look at. I have but one complaint and that's that the handheld cam can get a little too shaky where it feels like we're watching a scene out of Cloverfield.The acting is really good from Justin Chon and Alicia Vikander. He goes for it giving his best performance yet, though Vikander stole the show for me. Maybe this is because of his character. I wanted to like him and I did to begin with. But as we learn more about him and see his true persona it can be difficult to like or connect with. There are bad decisions made that we know are what make him flawed, but since there's hardly any work to fix them, I didn't care too much for him as it went along. I wanted the overall outcome to be ok for him and his family, but it's difficult to like after some time. There's a character introduced that ends up being a bigger part. Linh Dah Pham does great with her, but her character didn't feel relevant other than a deeper meaning that was supposed to bring out more character. Most of the characters aren't written as well as they should be. What really annoyed me was the classic racist cop. He's an awful character as he should be and a necessary part, but all the dialogue given and how he is written just isn't that good. Since it falls into many tropes, you kind of have to get used to it after a while. There are scenes, mainly the end, where the music swells so loud to get at your emotions. It was a little overkill, but the music is good. And going back to the end, as abrupt as it may be I could understand and get behind it. Blue Bayou needed to find its voice a little more to make a grounded story. It's not bad, but it's another movie this September (and we've had multiple so far) that should've been better. It's alright but not one that I see myself revisiting for years."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11121664/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," One of the finest films about man's inhumanity to man made for a long time ","The movie does not start with a bang, and cinema-goers who want an immediate rush from films will miss that fist heady scene, as it does not exist in this film.However you quickly realise that the entire gamut of human emotion is in this film. Everything from shame, to pride, humility to ignorant arrogance, deep despair to transcendent joy. Everything is there in abundance and there are so many moral questions too.How far would you go to achieve a common aim? What would you relinquish of yourself to help others, what would you do to shame yourself for the sole purpose of raising others.There are also modern themes represented such as consent and police brutality, but much older, ancient themes such as morality, values, personal accountability and selflessness.Sadly this film also shows the flaws of a government that over-rides humanity in it's wild aim to follow policy. A controlling state that whilst it takes in refugees from unsettled nations, it makes refugees of it's own people. And every happiness, every heartbreak, every moment of emotion is finely and superbly acted and directed.Man's inhumanity to man is a term often bandied about when describing war. But the greatest inhumanity sis the cruelty exacted on people in times of peace, in the name of policy.There are no great statesman left in the world now who can protect and cherish us and our country. There is only vanity and personal prowess.Watch this film without any interruptions or gaps and you will see why western countries are nowhere near as great or as free as they like to have us believe."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11121664/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Got right sucked in not in a first person view but as an audience that being taken in every step ","Such a powerful movie without showing muscle in the movie. Action without real action, it is a rollercoaster of emotion. Being taken by the main actor in many dilemmas and external factors that he does not have control over. The audience really feel the amount of baggage and struggle of the main actor, but also the side actors played a very vital role. It really showed the many diversities of the adapted what was totally not put the focus on because they did not want to get a pity penny for being adapted but when the plot slowly open up by a natural process makes it very pleasant to follow and not an unloading of information. Also, The movie made it that complicated due to it gave so many diverse elements of what people that facing these problems ens experiencing without loading the audience with information or setting up many main actors to tell the stories, making it possible to create an in depth movie.The amount of struggle is loaded but still for me there could be more because it is a bit too much of a documentary than fiction. Not bad, but maybe just a crank or pinch extra should give more spice and more a movie that would attract more audience.Without knowing the story of the movie, you will suggested the movie ending soon half away. The build off to the end is done really nice and slowly, naturally.What I can say is the ending is just an unexpected twisting.The story give me a feeling people are treated even more badly than animals. Getting deported without any family to fall back on."

He speaks fluid English. He is married to a US citizen, and he and his wife are expecting their first child. He is a stepfather to Jessie (Sydney Kowalske), the daughter of his wife, Kathy, played by Alicia Vikander, who calls him daddy.Victim of racial profiling by a police officer, he is arrested and then his immigration status is called into question. Kathy and Antonio seek the counsel of a lawyer, played by Vondie Curtis-Hall, who informs them that before the year 2000, US foreign adoption laws were very ill defined, and in many cases immigration paperwork was never filed by adopting parents. In Antonio's case, his adopting family abandoned him after 6 months and he bounced around in foster care for much of his young life after coming to the US.The film was a powerful representation of the uncertainty and difficulty many immigrants face in the US. It was both deeply saddening and moving as you watch the turmoil the family endures, especially the child affected by it all. The film brings awareness to an important issue that has yet to be addressed and has been the cause of many, many deportations of adults who have lived in the US for 30 to 40 years and some times longer, do not even know the language of their country of origin, who are deported to this foreign land without any family connections or similar ties to the country they are being sent.Blue Bayou is an official selection of the 2021 Cannes Film Festival. The film contains some beautiful cinematography of the Louisiana bayou and breathtaking sunset shots taken around New Orleans. The screenplay also stood out in the way that he portrayed both the struggle and impossible choices the protagonist faces. Also, his own identity as an Asian American, looking for his past and a cultural touchstone and comparing it to the over thirty years he spent in Louisiana feeling like an outcast as the "other."~I found this very helpful."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11121664/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Agitprop for a good cause ","A free preview pass and Alicia Vikander attracted me to the movies this evening. The intense acting and generally good filmcraft are strengths. The regional accents and a certain performance of the namesake song are standouts. But there are diverging subplots all over the place, detracting from the main theme. Sometimes the characters do not ring true and are otherwise too unsympathetic.This was made expressly to champion the cause of international adoptees who become deportable because their stateside adopting parents failed to satisfy all the formalities. Their plight is akin to that of the Dreamers. The film comes just when a "fix" in the form of the proposed Adoptee Citizenship Act is pending. To get that enacted is indeed a worthy cause."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11121664/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," What a truly heartfelt moment ","The whole plot is quite confusing and the scrip not so clear on some points, but it does deliver a good message to the end, a sad message if I have to be honest!!!AN awful agenda has been used as excuse for deportation on regards of many adoptions during the 80's without checking the proper procedures.... I do wonder if any was available at such time, or real reasonable points and facts during such days !?????"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11121664/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," ICE cold but blown away ","This is not just a story of a stepfather facing deportation. The movie shows an immigration system that can and will tear families apart. At the end of the movie where they show real-life cases of other unnaturalised adoptees who are either facing deportation or have been deported along with the estimates by the Adoptee Rights Campaign of international adoptees who face similar circumstances, thats the part that hits you like a hammer.Back to the movie. Alicia Vikander puts down a very strong acting performance. The same applies to Justin Chon (writer, director and main-actor) and Sydney Kowalske. Sydney (Jessie) is the future of acting. The plot and plot twists are very well executed however sometimes a bit confusing. The only minor comment I have is me wondering if the movie could have been even better with Justin Chon only doing the acting and a third person doing the directing. Maybe even somebody to tidy up the script. Make no mistake, this is a movie you have to see. It leaves you with a disturbing sense of just how vicious it is to rip someone away from the only family and country they've ever known."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11121664/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," An emotional punch ","Passion runs deep in Blue Bayou. The story is simple and classic, but potent. Fundamentally, Blue Bayou is about a man who loves his family and is faced with an insurmountable obstacle. Urgent political themes, like racism and classism, are driving forces here, but this film hinges on the love between our protagonist and his adopted daughter. That is why praise must begin with Justin Chao, Alicia Vikander, and Sydney Kowalske for delivering beautiful performances that truly portray a loving family dynamic.From there, Blue Bayou surrounds its upsetting narrative with graceful filmmaking. The scenic imagery, somber soundtrack, and discreet sound design all provide room for the emotional highlights of our characters to echo loudly. Some might find this film overly simplistic or heavy-handed, but there is no doubt that this production is focused on its strengths. On top of its message being clear, Blue Bayou is saying something important. So, despite being somewhat one-dimensional, Blue Bayou packs an emotional punch.Writing: 7/10 Direction: 8/10 Cinematography: 9/10 Acting: 9/10 Editing: 8/10 Sound: 8/10 Score/Soundtrack: 8/10 Production Design: 8/10 Casting: 7/10 Effects: 7/10Overall Score: 7.9/10."

Among the more impressive aspects to be had here is the intricate and complex web of storylines present here involving the numerous plot points brought up. With the central story involving a tribe of peaceful Indians that were supposedly immune to diseases and somehow turned into a cult of pagan practitioners, an Indian curse featuring a generational abuse on its people for several centuries and finally resorting to possession, mental illness, and involvement in a slew of mysterious accidents spread throughout the town all being investigated by a detective assigned to the small town from a major city. This is an incredibly strong storyline that gives this one the potential to have something intriguing going on and the film works quite nicely because of it which sets up the idea of these things happening in a location like this. That also leads into the films' series of supernatural scares once these various elements have been fully explored. The idea of the house he's living in being haunted by a malevolent spirit dominates the first half, causing some short shock jump-scares that further the idea of something going on involving the family curse that was brought up at the beginning of the film. Other scenes, including the idea of something out in the woods serving as a physical representation of the supernatural entity they're fighting generate some solid sequences here or featuring the possessed individual speaking in demonic tones to himself about the strange curse about to be wrought. With a solid finale offering some supernatural action and a fun resolution to everything, there are some rather likable factors at play here. There isn't much really wrong here, but it's a big issue and is quite detrimental. That is the films' obviously overlong and unnecessary running time that has no business being as long as it is, with the intricate storyline coming into play with several issues here. Not only is it all way too complex and overbearing for something of this nature, but there's also way too much going on here that is never explained or overexplained leading to several other side issues from its length. Since way too much is going on here, the film also desperately needs an editor to trim this down as the film's a good twenty-thirty minutes too long as it is with scenes here coming off as unnecessary and need to be removed or scenes that go on way past their usefulness, including many of the interactions between the detective and her daughter which play into the film's storyline but are just overlong. It's the one issue with the film and holds it back the most.Rated Unrated/R: Graphic Language and Violence."

The storytelling was really compelling; intertwining indigenous culture, a police investigation and a paranormal element which really gave me everything! The slow burn approach created so much suspense and was so unnerving at times, I had to watch it through my fingers. As an indigenous woman, our people are not visible and our stories are often ignored by the world. Although the mixed race tribe in the film is fictitious, it drew out a lot of realities for my people who have been seen as pagans and devil worshippers and were taken and murdered for believing in our cultures and traditions. This was specifically seen with women and children, which brings the realities of all our missing and murdered indigenous women, girls and two spirit from the past to present day. This film tackles these very important realities within our community, and I am thankful that it was done in a tasteful yet artistically sensitive way that was really impactful. The beautiful setting of Western Massachusetts in the winter was incredibly cinematic and so haunting. The casting was done really well too, with authentic performances that felt like they were coming from real people. I was also really happy to see black and indigenous representation in this film, as well as interracial marriages and mixed children. This movie really had it all! If you are looking for something different, that is not your standard horror/thriller, that gives you all the thrills and chills but more meaningful than what is on the surface...this film is for you!"

It's the sort of film that makes you want to watch it multiple times to catch what you missed, however, if I was just able to watch the film this one time, I'd still come away feeling satisfied that I'd seen a thought-provoking film that was extremely well written, directed, and executed!"

I do wish that they use some of the live action actors for the voices. As for this story, it's good to center it on Wednesday but it does make the rest of the family more like supporting characters. The better drama is probably Wednesday being kidnapped and the family working together to rescue her. For this movie, the middle meanders around. Their stops are rather random. They go to Niagara Falls instead of Salem. It's not the best choice. I do like the fish-out-of-water aspect of going to Miami beach. This seems to be trying to be Vacation or something.

","Well, if you enjoyed the 2019 animated movie "The Addams Family" then you will most certainly also enjoy this 2021 sequel titled "The Addams Family 2".It was quite enjoyable to see that the animated movie kept the originality, humor and odd art style that was seen in the 2019 movie, which made for a great sense of familiarity and continuity.The storyline told in "The Addams Family 2" is spooky and ooky - see what I did there? Yup, the storyline was one that was every bit as fun and enjoyable as it was something that certainly had that particular Addams Family magic to it. There is something for the entire family to be enjoyed here in this 2021 animated movie, kids and adults alike.It should be said that the art style is quirky, but I found it to be rather enjoyable. And yeah, the art style definitely match the oddity that is the Addams Family, so it was spot on yet again. The animation is good and fluid, and there is an abundance of great details to be noticed in the scenes, which does make for an interesting second viewing of the movie.There is a good amount of fun and laughs throughout the course of the entire movie.With "The Addams Family 2" being an animated movie, of course having a good voice cast is crucial. And believe you me, they certianly had that with this one. The voice actors and actresses were so well-cast for the individual roles, and it was quite an impressive ensemble, with the likes of Oscar Isaac, Charlize Theron, Chlo Grace Moretz, Nick Kroll, Bette Midler, Bill Hader and Wallace Shawn."The Addams Family 2" is an animated movie that certainly is watchable for Halloween, just as it an animated movie that just as easily can be enjoyed the rest of the year. Me and my family were genuinely entertained by this 2021 animated movie.My rating of "The Addams Family 2", from directors Greg Tiernan, Conrad Vernon and Laura Brousseau lands on a six out of ten stars."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11125620/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Addam poor effort... ","Whilst I didn't actually hate this film, I really left the cinema wondering just who it was made for? The youngsters at the screening were soon bored and though there are a few jokes hidden away for the adults, we were not long in following them down this path of colourfully animated, but really pretty lacklustre ennui. The story centres around "Wednesday" being lured by a mad scientist to share her body transfer formula with him. To achieve this end, he tries to convince her that she is not a true "Addams" and this tests all the family bonds and loyalties. The best scenes belong to "Lurch" - doing his best Gloria Gaynor on the piano in a bar full of maladjusted bikers, but otherwise it really is a pretty dull experience that shows off the animators art well, but much less so that of the screenwriters, the director or, particularly, the acting talents of Charlize Theron, Oscar Isaac or even the sparing appearances of "Grandma" (Bette Midler). I did quite like their motor-home though..."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11125620/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," More A Hoot Than A Horror ","An animated feature-length cartoon catering primarily to children, "The Addams Family 2" qualifies as more of a hoot than a horror. The spooky cartoons the late Charles Addams drew for The New Yorker magazine between 1938 and his death in 1988 inspired this imaginative but bizarre, 93-minute, PG-rated chiller. Those vintage, single-panel, pen and ink sketches juggled horror and humor with clever sophistication. In 1964, the Addams Family stepped from those pages and trod across television screens in a weekly, 30-minute, black & white, ABC-TV series. Most of the show's humor emerged from the cultural clash between the eccentric Addams and the everyday citizens who accosted them. Sadly, "The Addams Family" withered on the airwaves after only two seasons, before resuming life as a Hanna Barbera cartoon series that few can recount. Indeed, television-the electronic fireplace--huddled families together happily in the warmth of hearth and home. Several classic television series hailed the virtues of family life, such as "The Waltons," "The Beverly Hillbillies," "The Brady Bunch," "Little House on the Prairie," "Bonanza," "The Jeffersons," and "The Flintstones." Inevitably, CBS-TV conjured up its own campy comedy "The Munsters." Like "The Addams Family," "The Munsters" fared no better, lasting from 1964 to 1966. Later, two live-action theatrical films "The Addams Family" (1991) and "Addams Family Values" (1993), co-starring Anjelica Huston and Raul Julia followed, but the franchise faded. "Sausage Party" co-directors Greg Tiernan and Conrad Vernon rebooted the franchise with their animated slapstick comedy "The Addams Family" (2019), and it succeeded in spawning a sequel. "The Addams Family 2" has scared up sufficient coin that the producers have announced another installment for October 2022. Gleefully, these two feature-length animated escapades have mixed the merry with the macabre. While some of the wit may puzzle younger minds, anybody who remembers "The Addams Family" fondly will smirk at this latest incarnation.The precocious daughter of Morticia and Gomez, Wednesday Addams (Chlo Grace Moretz of "Carrie") is attending a National Science Fair with her peers when things unfold. She conducts an experiment to show she can isolate a personality trait in her pet octopus Socrates, which enables it to align three Rubik's Cubes at once, and implant said trait into her goofy relative, Uncle Fester (Nick Kroll), so he can align a Rubik's Cube just as swiftly. Compared to the other mundane science projects, Wednesday's is far advanced. Sadly, to her chagrin, the Strange Foundation Science Fair judges reward all participants. Dismayed by this "everybody's special, so everybody's a winner" credo, Wednesday is surprised when the Science Fair sponsor materializes before her eyes. Cyrus Strange (Bill Hader) appears in a hologram to congratulate her on her brilliant demonstration. Strange urges Wednesday to share her research. She refuses on the grounds they are "family secrets." Meantime, Wednesday abhors her hopelessly affectionate father's lavish attention. Gomez gushes where his daughter is concerned. Since she rebuffs him, Gomez (Oscar Isaac) schedules an Addams family road trip, with destinations--like Death Valley--, so the family can bond. Wednesday cringes at this prospect. Died-in-the-wool "Addams Family" aficionados will probably spot some similarities between the Hanna Barbera cartoons and this opus since both chronicle a cross-country excursion.Just as they are to depart in their bizarre Gothic family camper, a shrimpy California lawyer, Mustela (Wallace Shawn) ,approaches Gomez for a sample of Wednesday's DNA. Mustela represents Mr. Strange who believes his daughter was switched at birth in the hospital. Strange will stop at nothing to convince Wednesday that she is his long-lost daughter. A hilarious scene ensues wherein creepy Uncle Fester reveals he visited Wednesday in the newborn nursery while the nurses were elsewhere. Gomez's lunatic brother woke up the soundly sleeping babies. Frantically, he juggled the hysterical infants like balls to lull them back to sleep. Afterward, Fester forgot if he put them back into the right cribs. Suddenly, Gomez and Morticia fear that Wednesday may not be their daughter. Later, when she arrives at Strange's house in Sausalito, Strange reveals the findings of their DNA match, and Wednesday wonders if she is indeed Strange's daughter."The Addams Family 2" abounds with amusing PG-rated sight gags, one-liners, and scary movie references. When the Addams prepare for their three-week road trip, Uncle Fester examines the engine of their hulking camper. "Oh, it's a hybrid," he exclaims, "half car, half eyesore!" Later, when Wednesday and Lurch flee from the Addams, so Wednesday can satisfy her curiosity about whether or not the villainous Mr. Strange is her blood kin, they reach a crossroads. The sign bristles with the names of several destinations. Haddonfield from "Halloween" (1978), Crystal Lake from "Friday the 13th" (1980), the Overlook Hotel from "The Shining" (1980), Amityville from "The Amityville Horror" (1979), Elm Street (from "A Nightmare on Elm Street" (1984), and The Light House from "The Lighthouse" (2019) are among those names that refer to the settings of R-rated horror movie classics. When she must dance in the Lil' Miss Jalapeno Pepper Pageant in Texas, Wednesday exacts her vengeance on the other dancers and drenches them in blood in a callback to the two Stephen King "Carrie" movies. Gomez reads himself to sleep with King's novel "The Shining." Mr. Strange emerges as a clone of the infamous Dr. Moreau from the H. G. Wells horror novel "The Island of Dr. Moreau." Strange has created his daughter from a pig and transformed a screeching flamingo into his wife. The best play on words occurs when Uncle Fester changes into an octopus. Gomez warns his brother that his 'tenacles' are showing. You cannot sit through "The Addams Family 2" once and hope to catch all the fractious humor that lurks beneath the surface of its horrific hilarity."

I think the word animation is synonymous with sequel because every one of them gets one.After fighting off Margaux Needler and winning over the town of Assimilation in the first one, The Addams Family has another crisis and Wednesday is at the center of it. A mad scientist from Sausalito is claiming that Wednesday (voiced by Chole Grace Moretz) is his daughter and she begins to believe that she just may have been switched at birth. This is a serious blow to Gomez (voiced by Oscar Isaac) and Morticia (voiced by Charlize Theron), but how can they fight scientific facts?I saw this one in the movie theater just to get out and do something with the kids. In that sense it was worth it. I don't think I make the same move pre-pandemic. "The Addams Family 2" was OK. I didn't think they needed to make an animated version in the first place, so naturally I believe a sequel is superfluous."

Oscar & Charlize are feeling that the kids are growing up and need a family vacation to reconnect so most of the time is spent traveling the USA in an RV-not just a regular RV, but an Addams family version. In a side plot, Bill plays a scientist that makes some accusations about one of the members of the Addams family's true heritage. Other celebrity voices doing cameos include Wallace Shawn, Nick Kroll, Snoop Dogg & Bette Midler.It's rated "PG" for rude humor, violence and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 33 minutes.If you liked the first one then you should enjoy this one.

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11125620/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," This picture captures the Addams universe perfectly and is a must see for fans of the horror family ","The Addams Family Values (2021) is a movie my daughter and I recently watched together at the movies.

Dad tries to offset her concern by planning a family road trip hoping to rebuild their relationship. This movie is codirected by Greg Tiernan and Conrad Vernon, who worked together on Sausage Party, and contains the voices of Oscar Isaac (Star Wars: Last Jedi), Charlize Theron (Monster), Chlo Grace Moretz (Tom & Jerry), Bette Midler (Hocus Pocus) and Martin Short (Three Amigos). The animation in this remains outstanding and the storyline and circumstances were way better than the first film. The voices are well selected and the soundtrack was excellent too.

Later on he somehow manages to blow up most of the Grand Canyon, earning him eight consecutive life terms at Ft. Leavenworth for vandalizing a national park. Real Life rangers there have been predicting for years that such park features as Phantom Ranch and the two foot bridges crossing the Colorado River would be wiped out by the inevitable failure of the leaking Glen Canyon Dam. However, the water level in Lake Powell (a reservoir created by the dam in the 1960's) is now so low that IF the dam were to be destroyed by Pugsley Addams (or anyone else) its loss might not even be noticed by hikers and/or rafters downstream."

Totally stupid & embarrassing unfunny. Not even the little kids Laughed at all.I found it so hard to sit through it as each embarrassing forced situation happened with no funnny bits at all.So annoying because it could've been such a fun vacation movie about the Addams Family getting into all types of mischief whilst visiting different places on a fun road trip but NO!!! We get a silly story about missing identity & a big damp squid.No character gets anything funny to do or say at all, I'm not joking. Uncle fester who was hilarious in the first film spends the whole time playing off of his tentacle arms as he's changing & it's embarrassing.Seriously one of the worst sequels ever & one of the worst Animated films ever in my opinion."

Plenty of film references, Ma, Jaws, Carrie. Also song and dance numbers the best being Lurch playing the piano and singing I Will Survive.

Knowing it could be one of the few last times.Still not as good but cute nonetheless the sequel."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11125620/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Addam Fun Film. But Still Limited In Plot Execution ","LIKES:Animation is Good: It's no Pixar or Walt Disney Studios, but the MGM studios has prepared a delightful adventure that moves fluidly, has that same quirky design, and is just a fun adventure to say the least. Despite the gruesome nature of the ghouls of this family, the animation is welcoming for all ages, dark enough to be enjoyed by fans of upper years, but still appropriate for the children of the group. The caricature nature of it has a certain charm to it, and the fact the fluid nature adds whimsy to it and does it so clean and fluid makes for a nice alternative to the bigger studios.Voice Acting: Much like the first film, I think the vocal performances are fine for the most part in this movie, still living true to the characters without coming off too stiff or one dimensional. Isaac's lead as Gomez is a nice mimicry of the classic roles, loud, boisterous, but still concerning and touching when called for. Charlize Theron is ready to bring the same poise and prim nature of Morticia that oozes the finesse of the lead female role, but again adds a slight layer of touching warmth that this installment calls for in the deeper lessons. Chloe Grace Moretz does a fantastic job with the monotone, depressed voice of Wednesday, delivering the sort of desolate and cold performance that was made famous year ago. It's that dark sass and grim outlook that sells the character's darker comedy, and she continues to pull it off quite well. Nick Kroll as well gets a nod for the imbecile of Fester. Though not the spirited performances of the past, he still captures the nave idiocy of the Uncle, with that same charm and fun that all renditions have held long ago. I liked the expanded performance he brought in this film, that still kept to the roots, but also allowed new territory to be explored with this particular installment.The Better Character Utilization: Again, it's not the show or the Family Values we got long ago, but this second installment for this reboot did a much better job using most of its characters in a deep manor. Gomez's approach to new avenues of parenthood were better designed to show the care for his family's well-being. Morticia still took a large amount of the show, but again held elements that were charming, fun, and still true to the character's usual elegance. Wednesday got a much larger role, and past the typical bullying of Pugsley, actually had a little more sentiment behind it despite what the girl normally does. She was certainly the centerpiece, but it worked super well with the elements and I liked seeing the story take a closer look at what lies beneath the shell. Fester, Pugsley, Thing, and even Lurch were all given some expansion as well, and though still not taking the center stage, held a purpose and some great scenes that I think wins a nod of approval from me. As for Cousin It, much better use in this film, which though primarily laugh factor and merchandizing... still was enjoyable for me.The Comedy Mixture: True, this Addams family is geared to a much younger audience in humor with farting, slapstick, and plenty of stupid moments that they will want to watch again and again. However, there is still plenty of clever wit to the film if you keep your eyes open, including references to several quirks and tropes in the modern day. Pokes at the internet, the obsession with texting, insurance commercials, and even how nonsensical plots can get are just some of the jokes I particularly enjoyed. This mixture of both simple and complex jokes kept things interesting and fun, avoiding the traps of lazy writing that movies sometimes fall into and skirting the excessive territory quite well. Again, it is all in good fun and spirit, which I believe kids can handle with ease and grown-ups can stomach.The Deeper Morals: Hands down I enjoyed the story taking a stab at some more grown up story arcs for the movie. The main story is all about finding oneself and what it means to be a part of a family, something many of us have had to face in a lifetime. Wednesday's search for herself ends up bleeding into just about every character, and it was nice to see the chemistry of the family challenged past the typical ghouls in a human world motif. Pugsley's story may have been more for comedic purposes, but even there they scratched into a young boy trying to push past his awkwardness and dive into a new, yet familiar, stage of life. His work with Uncle Fester continues the plot from the first movie, and again expands in both laughs and emotional moments between them.DISLIKES: Incomplete Story Elements Still: Though I enjoyed the new story, and much of the expansion past the static tale of the first rendition, I still kind of felt this sequel did not touch on everything they could have. Pugsley's connection with his own parents is a bit limited for my tastes, and it seems like this time he was the afterthought of the family. Fester's comedic relief was fun, but his estrangement is still a bit isolating and not nearly as fleshed out as the live action movies we got back in the 90s. Yet the worst tale was the Grandmother's side hustle at home, which gets alluded to a few times but stops the roll before the snowball gets too big. Having those tangents set up a lot of fun jokes to use Bette Midler's voice talents, but that potential was dropped too quickly and seemed forgotten. Again, I'm all for creativity and fun, but execute the ordeal if you are going to make it a big point or don't include it.The Bad Guy: While he certainly brings that Addams family quality of disturbing bad guys with that twist that is really weird, it still needs some work. Part of it was trying to make a twist for them to surprise us with, which kind of failed, so I can understand. However, the movie's villain needed more screen time and shadowy behavior then what we got with him. There is a great joke to comment about how little the villain is used, but I for one really wanted to see more planning in his use and the same meticulous infiltration into the family's gullibility than what we got, which was mainly at the end of the movie. This would have included some tertiary and secondary characters getting more opportunity to shine and elude the mystery, and offer a chance for some interactions between Fester, Pugsley, and practically anybody else.The Ending: It's not how the tale finished that I disliked, but more so just how fast the ending hit. The second installment takes it's time and detours to help lay out the story and build up the obstacles to the family, only to have it all hit the ending too quickly. As I said in the villain section, there was not enough time or challenge by the antagonist to engage us in his threat, or even allow the Addams spirit to push their buttons. The whole conflict itself is rather simplistic and one sided, lacking the dark charm and finesse the live action movie had for solving the problem. Ture, it did bring a Fester plot point full circle to which I enjoyed several times, but still there was so much more that could have been done to extend on the fun at hand. Even the Bette Milder story seems like a tacked on add on, missing a really good closing number to put in a hasty end credits art piece.The VERDICT: Addams Family 2 turned into a better movie for me than the first attempt at rebooting this series. I liked how the movie moved so to speak, with fun animation and spirit to help liven up the fun and keep the tale from becoming stagnant. With better character utilization, mostly, clever jokes for all ages, and a deeper moral themed narrative, it's got a lot of strengths in the family movie night department, so long as you can take an alternative to Disney. Still, the movie does have some limitations that still need to be worked out for this reviewer. Side stories need to be eliminated or utilized better, alongside working on ironing out all creases in the family story line. I'd have liked to see the villain get more time and involvement with the plot, to help capture the dark and haunting charm this family always has with them. And more importantly not rush the ending and hastily tie up the tale they are working hard to tell. Still, this one was fun to watch at home, and if you had a group, could be a fun trip to the theaters. I encourage everyone giving this a look at in the future. My scores are:Animation/Adventure/Comedy: 7.5 Movie Overall: 6.5."

Families of all ages should be super pumped for this relatable and fun new film.The Addams Family 2 has a fantastic storyline that is focused on Wednesday (Chloe Grace Moretz), who is stuck between two families, not sure which one she actually shares her DNA. She uses her impressive chemistry and scientific abilities to try to determine her destiny. Is her real father Gomez Addams (Oscar Isaac), who raised her, or the one who gives seemingly incontrovertible proof, Cyrus (Bill Hader). The battle is a constant inner conflict within Wednesday as she faces decisions that could change her life forever. Along with this main plotline, there are other problems and situations, like how Uncle Fester (Nick Kroll) is showing strange symptoms or how Grandma (Bette Midler) is throwing a party when she's supposed to be taking care of the house while the Addams are on vacation.There are so many wonderful aspects that make The Addams Family 2 a must-see. The story is well-written with a conflict for each character and many strong subplots. The only slight weak point is that the story is a bit slow in starting. However, once the rising action begins, the film flies by in a flurry of adventure and humor. The funniness of this film is truly incredible. It is an action-based film, but still incorporates so much humor into every part. The locations are very accurate, despite being animated. For people who have visited some of these places, it is so cool to be able to see an animated representation of them. Some of the places include Niagara Falls, Miami beaches, Death Valley, Texas deserts and the Grand Canyon. Besides the strong story and fun locations, the family-based conflicts are so relatable for real families. Everyday things such as siblings arguing, parent-child relationships, struggles to belong and not feeling like yourself are common within the Addams family. Wednesday and Pugsley Addams (Javon Walton) are constantly fighting; Gomez Addams feels as if he falls short in including Wednesday in things and Morticia Addams (Charlize Theron) tries her best to comfort everyone. The animation for all of the characters is outstanding. The voice acting is one of the more positive aspects of the film; all the actors sound exactly like their character and we can imagine what the character is feeling or thinking. Bill Hader, as Cyrus, makes a wonderfully mysterious character. Chloe Grace Moretz's Wednesday is a seemingly cold character who opens up as the film progresses; her voice acting really is superb.The theme of The Addams Family 2 is to be yourself and to not force someone to be who they're not. It also emphasizes being careful about who you trust with important things. There are some very mild insulting comments and, of course, some creepy science scenes.The Addams Family 2 gets 4.5 out of 5 stars from me and I recommend it for ages 6 to 18 plus adults. Addams Family 2 releases in theaters October 1, 2021, so check it out! By Kyla C., KIDS FIRST!"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11125620/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Great Family Fun ","The Addams Family 2Some mean reviews on here and not sure why!I really enjoyed this movie, it got of to a slow start establishing the story, however 30 mins in it moved up a gear.The movie reached its very best when Lurch sang "I will survive" with a biker gang, truly inspired.This was all round family fun, I'm giving this a hard 7 outta 10, meaning you won't be disappointed."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11125620/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Addams Family trip ","I didn't know that much about the plot except that it was about them going on a family road trip, after watching it I got more then I expected.I still like the The Addams and the voice actors playing them, I found it pretty funny and the animation was nice looking and pretty.The villain wasn't anything that big but the 3rd act was really weird and strange, I enjoyed this a bit more than the first but I still liked both of them.I won't give away anything, but if you get a chance I suggest giving it a watch."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11125620/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," Fun but not like the first ","So this movie was fun and funny and all, but it was not as good as the first one was. I barely heard anyone laugh including myself. It was like if they were trying too hard to be funny."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11125620/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," The Addams family 2 ","2021 PG director: Greg Tiernan, Conrad Vernon.Starring: Charleze Theron, Oscar Isaac, Chloe Grace Moretz, Bill Hader, Javon Walton, Nick Kroll, Snoop Dogg, Bette Midler, Wallace Shawn etcEveryone's favourite spooky family is back in the animated comedy sequel, The Addams Family 2. In this all-new movie, we find Morticia and Gomez distraught that their children are growing up, skipping family dinners, and totally consumed with "scream time." To reclaim their bond, they decide to cram Wednesday, Pugsley, Uncle Fester, and the crew into their haunted camper and hit the road for one last miserable family vacation. Their adventure across America takes them out of their element and into hilarious run-ins with their iconic cousin, It, as well as many new kooky characters. What could possibly go wrong? For me this was a pleasant surprise!My first few positives would be the great animation and humour. As well as the fun strange tone, great family dynamic and voice cast. With a great soundtrack. This film's animation was very impressive. It expanded the universe, and it went bolder and brighter. And was really a visual treat for the eyes embracing the weirdness of the world. I also thought the humour was stronger along with the strange tone this time around. This film really dialled up the strange interactions between the family and how they communicate with each other, I felt like they played it safe the first time around but this time they embraced the kooky and dark nature of the characters, with some clever and funny jokes that will go over a lot of children's heads. What helped with the humour was the more focused family dynamic. Each character got their opportunity to shine whilst also having the conflict and themes around the family as the focus. I also thought the voice cast was amazing as always. They bought the characters to life excellently, with charismatic and fun voice performances that gave so much life to the characters. And the soundtrack was delightfully spooky and fun and added a lot of entertainment value to particular scenes. With the iconic Addams family theme always being a bonus.However, the film was far from perfect and still flawed. My few negatives for the film would be the underdeveloped and rushed set up. The lazy and unneeded plot points. As well as the generic elements and lapses in the logic with some characters. I thought that the film didn't lay enough groundwork for the setup, due to the frantic pacing. They didn't really reintroduce us as the audience to the characters again or with clear villains or reasoning behind their travels beyond the one dimensional. I also felt like the film had some lazy and unneeded plot points. The film did sometimes feel very incoherent and messy and was stuffing as much as they could in such short amount of time, it was hard to keep up. And certain elements added to characters such as Pugsley felt forced and didn't really hold much of a purpose to the plot. I also felt like the film did fall into a lot more genre tropes then the first instalment. Especially with the jokes aimed at pop culture that felt jarring and often out of place. And the film did fall into more of a safe and generic animation which impacted my score for it. Finally, there was some lapses in the logic where it was obvious something was wrong with Uncle Fester and the movie made the characters seem dumb, and the film didn't link the plot point or really include it until later on so it felt messy.My final few positives would be the fun scenes and development to the plot. As well as the more focused conflict with the family and the good development between them. Whilst also having great pacing and villain plus strong themes. The film had a lot of fun scenes that allowed the characters to shine in their delightful strangeness, playing around with their powers and added to the films more focused tone. I also thought the plot development was strong, the film did a good job at balancing the fun scenes establishing the family dynamic and adding more layers to the plot with the villain and connecting them as the film transitioned into the final act. I also appreciated that the film had more focused conflict between the family and stronger themes. The first film felt unfocused with its themes and the specific conflict. But this time they chose a specific character aka Wednesday and built the conflict around her character, focusing on parenting and feeling out of place within the family. For me it was a more clear and better developed source of conflict for the family, and it worked a lot better, raising some heart-warming themes on family and acceptance. Finally, I thought the pacing and the villain was strong. The film didn't overstay its welcome, moving at a fast pace whilst still including a good amount of plot, I was consistently entertained and there was never a dull moment. I also think the villain was a lot stronger this time around. His reasoning and connection with Wednesday was fascinating, and he was a lot more campy and over the top which fitted much better with the characters and the tone of the film then the villain in the first film.Overall, Addams family 2 still suffers from some weak writing and being slightly too chaotic. But this for me was an improvement over the first film. It felt more focused and embraced the strangeness of the characters and it just worker better for me. This is a great Halloween film for the family and I had a good time with it.Overall score 77/100."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11125620/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," The second Addams Family seems a bit too simple made ","The Addams Family on an Adventure is the sequel to The Addams Family from 2019. This sequel is directed by Greg Tiemand and Conrad Vernon, who also directed the first film together.In the film, the Addams family goes on vacation to improve their family ties. During their adventures, they lack many things that put their family bond to the test.This sequel feels a bit rushed and seems to copy many elements from the first part and further uses elements from the third Hotel Transylvania movie. For young viewers, some elements such as the feeling of being an outsider may not really appeal to them yet, because they are still too young for this. Because the film jumps from place to place with a new storyline at every new place, younger viewers can lose their concentration.The comedy is largely intended for younger viewers, because most comedy moves quickly and is not really developed. For mature viewers, there are a few moments of laughter in it, but they aren't that strong. Most humor consists of simple jokes, which can be easily predictable for older viewers.The animation looks appropriate, but otherwise it doesn't come across as special in the film. This is the same with the voice acting of the movie cast. Most characters are voiced again by the same actors, but because of the simple script they don't really get the chance to do anything special with their roles."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11125620/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," Some funny moments but overall pretty poor ","I must admit I didn't hold out high hopes for this film and sadly this proved right. I didn't find it that good as an adult and I doubt children would find it much better.There were some funny moments in it, which saved it a bit, and the film did rattler through at a reasonable pace. Overall though it was disappointing."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11125620/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Storyline is so so ","Family night out. I asked my kids how was the movie. They didn't like it.... The storyline wasn't that interesting. They didn't laugh at any of the humor. Nowadays, so many animation movies, they have to have a good script to get kids attention."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11125620/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," Not that good. ","There are a few amusing scenes but that is all the film really is. A few good ideas for scenes, mainly in the first 30 minutes and last ten, but little else and some cobbled together story to stretch it out to 90 minutes."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11127680/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," a remarkable one shot take 'chef' movie ","'Boiling Point', the second film by English director Philip Barantini will be, I think, one of the sensations of the cinematographic year 2021. It has been presented so far in only a few festivals and will meet with the broader public in cinema halls starting in October. There are in this film, bold in form and sensitive in content, the premises of a love story with the audiences.'Boiling Point' is filmed in one shot take, i.e in a single long frame. This is not the first film to use this technique that requires intense training and formidable logistics. My experiences with movies like this are mixed. The film considered by many to be a masterpiece of the genre, Aleksandr Sokurov's 'Russian Ark' tired and annoyed me (I apologize to the fans of the director or the film for my blunt opinion). Even '1917' (which cheated a little with the technical process) did not excite me, I did not find the connection between story and technique except at the level of gimmick. On the other side, I was enthusiastic about 'Victoria' by the German director Sebastian Schipper, the description of a tumultuous Berlin night lived by a young Spanish immigrant. I gave it a rare 10/10 rating on IMDB. To a large extent, 'Boiling Point' comes close to this level, and it has helped me understand when one shot take filming works well for me. Life itself, as we live it, is a single take film or, if you will, a series with single-take episodes and sleep breaks. Realistic dramas that happen in real time and in one place or in places connected by the movements of the characters fit the formula perfectly. This is exactly the case with 'Boling Point', which takes place in the kitchen and dining room of a high-end restaurant. After watching for a few minutes the movements of the camera (handled by Matthew Lewis) the story and the characters absorbed me and I forgot (for a while at least) the technical aspects. This is the best sign of success.Before becoming a director, Philip Barantini was an actor and ... a chef. His previous two professions helped him considerably and contributed to the quality of the film. The director knows perfectly the secrets of cuisine, the organisation of the kitchen and of the services in a good restaurant, and especially the people who work in these institutions at the top of the culinary industry and art. Understanding the environment and knowing the actors helped him select an excellent team, made up of mostly experienced actors, many with dozens of movies in their filmographies, who did not refuse to play supporting roles, some with short screen time, but all significant. Of course, Stephen Graham stands out in the role of Andy, the talented chef who faces during the 90 minutes of the film and of the events on the screen the tough problems in the restaurant and in his personal life. I have been following the evolution of Stephen Graham for some time and in my opinion he has now become one of the best actors in British cinema.I hope that 'Boiling Point' will enjoy a good promotion. I believe that those who see it will enjoy an original cinematic work, which adds a new dimension to the restaurants and chefs films genre. It may also be that the customer experience and appreciation of the staff when they dine next time at such a top restaurant will be different as well."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11127680/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," Top notch!! ","#BoilingPoint takes you on an immersive tension filled evening in front and behind the scenes of a busy five star restaurant. Performances are top notch in this incredible documentary style filmed one shot experience. One of 2021's most compelling films."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11127680/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Gordon Ramsay meets "Uncut Gems" ","One take movies have been around for a while and while "Birdman" snuggles in a few cuts and therefore cant be considered a one take movie, "Boiling Point" is literally a 90in play, more like "Victoria", which is a much longer movie though.The coordinations and technical difficulties that come with it are handled very well and Stephen Graham is undoubtably the only star in this movie, BUT you dont feel this, as he is supported by a brilliant cast. Especially Vinette Robinson is stunning with her facial expressions of all possible emotions you can feel in such a high pressured environment.The only "downside" of this movie is, that it can seem a little bit "too much" at times, like all stereotypes of people that work in this industry suddenly came all together and work in this one restaurant in London, which was exactly the point I think, but it takes a little bit of the realism away at times.The "Chekovs gun" is a bit to much on the nose and you see it coming from a mile away, but still the conclusion and execution of it was handled brilliantly!The amount of comic relief is just the right dose and its combined with a stunning dramatic performance by Stephen Graham, so you feel like you have a perfectly spiced dish on your plate!I'm keen to see what Philip Barantini has on his menu next!"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11127680/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," Utterly exhausting in the best possible way ","Film making at its absolute best. Sensational, on point casting only amplifies the tone and message of this absolute cracking film. Needs to be seen in a theatre so you can truly immerse yourself."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11127680/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," Superb One Shot Take up to the Boiling Point ","Had been fortunate enough to watch this during the #17 ZFF and meet the cast afterwards. Have to say I've been a bit skeptical about the title, even though the premise sounded solid but as fine dining like sex it's "what you get what matters not what you are missing". I haven't missed a thing with Philipp Barantini's excellent one shot drama / thriller which is tense and builds up from the very 1st second the camera started rolling. A busy night in fine dining starts when tables are overbooked on a Friday night before Christmas, no biggies here could be an average intro to an average cooking / restaurant drama which we've seen many times before. But here the twist is that the whole movie apart from the scripted story arc is entirely improvised and taken in one shot, which gets immediately obvious once Emily (Hannah Walters) and Tim (Kieran Urquhart) have a genuine pivotal interaction which sets up the movie towards the rollercoaster what to expect and to be suspicious to pay for attention very closely. Don't get me wrong Andy (Stephen Graham) our Chef heads to the restaurant steals the screen immediately to slowly build up tension but up until the aforementioned interaction it's relatively easy going. The ending had me a bit mischieved yet settling in after a couple of minutes fully satisfied and reflected to the entire 90 minutes as its a good ending and perfectly fitting to the whole story, but yet this story is rather a semi cinema variet towards a cathartic climax. Take an advice and go watch 2021's one of the best thrillers so far!"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11128342/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," Super good! ","I'm so taken by the movie. Highly recommend to watch it. The performance of the main character is breathtaking! Breathtaking!"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11131464/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," Fuhrman Excellence ","Captivating and the acting is amazing. The perfect mix of drama, thriller, and enough levity to avoid being too dark. The plot is great, but the acting elevates it to another level."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11131464/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," amazing ","I was so shook at how good the visuals were and how well the music was incorporated in the film. Not to mention the analogies and symbolisms.. amazing."

Very well-crafted scenes, sensitive and wonderful soundtrack, beautiful acting, very well done work, an emotionally touching perspective. Isabelle Fuhrman as always with impeccable acting and perfectly harmonious with the atmosphere."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11131918/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," Beautiful film, fantastic script ","The amazing visuals in this film are nicely balanced with a couple big topics: grieving, dealing with mortality, the end of the world. The solemnly heavy themes are magically offset by a powerfully subtle call-without an ounce of being preachy-for love and kindness and I left the film inspired to be a better person. Riveting acting performances amidst the Icelandic landscape calibrate the pace and bring viewers into an immersive and intimate experience. Highly recommend for all lovers of film, especially the themes mentioned above."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11131918/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," Very meditative gorgeous experience ","This film really allows a lot of space to be right along these characters, on their lost meanderings, as they attempted to make some last connections. I felt it was similar in tone to another spacious film, Nomadland. Where it was fine with letting characters be alone for a while, and you could breath it all in with them. I enjoyed every windy moment of it."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11131918/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," A gorgeous tone poem ","I love this film; the cinematography is gorgeous and the performances are understated and wonderful. As the film unfolds, we are invited in to observe and think - it's a meditative, compelling experience that rewards an attentive viewer."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11131918/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," A breathtaking meditation on apocalypse & grief from a refreshingly simple & movingly human perspective. ","I went to see 'Everything in the End' at IndieCork last month knowing very little about the film or the director Mylissa Fitzsimmons. I was intrigued by the synopsis and image in the programme enough to go to the film and had the feeling that it was either going to be really good or really bad. As a film that was about earth's final days I was just praying that zombies wouldn't be making an appearance. And my god, was I pleasantly surprised.The film is beautiful, meditatively paced, and wonderfully simple. The story follows a troubled young man, Paulo, as he navigates Iceland's tormented and unforgiving landscape that rhymes with the grief and existential dread the character is experiencing. Paulo is a sensitive, gentle soul, played by Hugo De Sousa with a great deal of vulnerability and enough angst to rival Sren Kierkegaard. He finds himself for some seemingly unknown reason on foreign shores in the last days of earth, when an equally obscure natural, or perhaps unnatural, disaster is imminent that will wipe out all of humanity. Everyone knows this, and everyone is trying to make peace with themselves, with the universe, and reach out to others and connect in their final days. This is when the film gets really interesting as it is not so much about the impending apocalypse but the connections Paulo makes with others in his final moments, and these moments are simple, spontaneous, and beautifully human.The film is made up of so many beautiful, fleetingly joyful, scenes, that play so bittersweetly given the context that surrounds them. The characters voices are sometimes almost lost to the wind and the overwhelming presence of nature stands over the small events of the story. But it is not so much about the words, Fitzsimmons makes this clear, many scenes are without dialogue or, as said, cannot be heard and there are many other languages in the film that are not translated. The film, it seems, is more about the actions of the characters and the humanity that they all share. Paulo's motivations are intriguing, he connects deeply with each character but must keep going, bound by some hidden pilgrimage that leads him to his last end. There is almost something Dantean about it in that regard. It also reminded me somewhat of Von Trier's Melancholia and the idea that when we are grieving or in despair, it feels like the whole world is ending. In this sense I do not think the film is meant to be taken completely literally, it is an inner landscape that Paulo is struggling through and it is a film that is meant to be felt rather than logically understood.The free and spontaneous cinematography capturing the breathtakingly stark beauty of Iceland also reminded me somewhat of Terrence Malick's later work. Cinematographer Todd Hickey has a poetic attention to detail; a close up of a toppled teacup rocking from side to side, some empty clothes pegs shivering in the cold; whilst also paying attention to the vastness of the surroundings and nature's rising fury as the end approaches. I was actually surprised that the film was made by an American crew as I felt that the study of landscape, the style, and pacing all felt very Icelandic!This film brought up a hell of a lot for me in a very brief hour and fifteen minutes, and the slow burn, meditative pace allows you to reflect more deeply upon its themes. The thing that I found so clever and moving about the film is that director Mylissa Fitzsimmons breaks down all of the background noise of the modern world and culture. The impending doom makes everything irrelevant, everything except basic human connection and closure. We are all going to die, this is what Fitzsimmons is reminding us of, but not in a morose or depressing way but an empathetic, and strangely uplifting way. It reminds us of what life is really about when it comes to the end; love, interconnectivity, and the simple joys of shared human experience. These values are, after all, everything in the end.Highly recommended."

This is a totally different genre but i actually ended up liking both the lead actors performance. I was to be fair a little judgy about the lead actor since he is also a producer and also the son of a coaching class person (Jog Classes) my cousins went to so wanted to ensure the tuition fees they paid 15 years ago was not put to waste :)Apart from a couple of scenes, I felt the movie was very well made. Different treatment but had the right mount of innocence and mush that one wants. Dont know about movie reviewers but I am sure this will find a much wider audience on Amazon .. people like me ... really liked the performance.A big shout out to the writer and director of the movie since they are kind of starting out and it in such movies always the known people get the credit.Also to Mr Jog since the concept of the movie was his idea.The music was really good, i wont be surprised if the songs are used in some Hindi movie in the futureWas an unexpected pleasure."

He makes a journey into the heart of the darkness as he meets with his banks clients or perhaps it's a descent into the circles of Hell as his driver's name is Dante. We witness corruption but also fear on the part of Yvan's upper class clients, the kleptocratic wing of the Junta is even seizing property belonging to the super rich, they are anxious to send money abroad. Even a big rancher cannot save his daughter who had leftist sympathies. The sense of evil is palpable and the tension builds as Yvan follows Rene's trail. A taut political thriller.

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11136276/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Very engaging and unique ","Very engaging slow-burner that somehow never bursts into flame. The only flaw I find in this movie, is that the ending seems not to have been given too much thought.But it presents a very unique quality: a perfect depiction of tension. There is tension everywhere, in every scene, in every character, throughout the whole movie. The masterfully crafted soundtrack does a major contribution there. This is a movie where there is no display of action. Every thing is as silent as the atrocities that we know for a fact were being committed while we watch these low voice conversations between wealthy people, bankers, clergy, all the way to the final "deal with the devil" moment."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11136276/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Oblique look at the Dirty War in Argentina-(Heart of Darkness)(SPOILER) ","Much of the film reminded me of Heart of Darkness in subject matter and theme.The scenes are glossy and engaging but this is ultimately a film about the Dirty War in Argentina and the human toll of the dictatorship--but told in an inventive, oblique way .This is also a film about ethical issues - in the world of banking in particular but equally applicable to the wider world.The film uses both experienced actors and novices who were plucked form the real world of the film.The film explores the effect of environment (immense wealth, banking) on character and moral choices.And besides- I have a real fondness for films that feature pools."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11136276/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," Ever wonder what private banking is really all about? This fascinating film makes it clearer than you might like ","This remarkable Argentine-Swiss coproduction is set in the early years of the Argentine rule-by-junta. The topic, though, is broader: the intersection of lite cupidity and brutal politics worldwide, cloaked under a veneer of high-class gentility and, of course, excruciatingly extreme discretion. The horrors endemic to the place and time in which the film is set are rendered obliquely and allusively, and all the more powerfully for that.The film is wonderfully cast. Every character, down to the smallest non-speaking cameo, conveys worlds of meaning, often in a single frame. Most striking of all is a Catholic Monsignor who is brilliantly parodied while he acts as a searingly sinister fulcrum, lifting part of the veil that hangs over the plot, putting me in mind of the terrifying Grand Inquisitor in Verdi's opera "Don Carlos" who pushes Philip II of Spain to kill his rebellious son just as, in order to save the world, "God sacrificed his own". This sequence, set during a small gathering in one of the inner sanctums of the junta lite, tells you more about what was then going on in Argentina than could more explicit scenes set in a torture chamber or execution field, while at the same time making clear what the banker is really there to do, and what the film is really about.The gentility and costly need for constant secretiveness (a lesson is even given in a secret argot used by Geneva bankers, including the meaning of "azor") are chillingly conveyed by the lead couple, played by Fabrizio Rongione and Stphanie Clau. He perfectly personifies the suave, ultra buttoned-down Swiss private banker, to the manor born, providing a master class in understated movie acting, conveying reactions with just the subtlest twitch of an eyelid or a small corner of his mouth. Her character is highly intelligent, ambitious, icily disciplined, both a judgmental antagonist and a tremendous resource for him, sussing out situations in which she is, even more (you sense) than usual in the macho world of the Argentine ruling classes (old and new), relegated to the sidelines, to the point of being more or less politely dismissed whenever serious business is to be discussed. (At one point, he is told to get rid of her prior to a key meeting: "no women".) She is perforce devoted to her husband yet bitter at the role she must play. Her greatest line, already widely quoted in reviews, comes when she is told by a tough-as-nails Argentine matriarch that she can see that "your husband loves you very much" (which is actually, you assume, a leading question), and Clau, still smooth and icy but with just the subtlest flash of anger, responds., "Yes, he and I are but a single person. [Perfectly-timed pause.} And that person is him".The film is in French and Spanish, with many of the Argentine characters (quite credibly, given their social standing) completely at home in French, while Rongione seems to have more than serviceable (though not perfect) Spanish. (Clau seems to have almost none, which, if anything, serves to enhance the acuity of her observations.) The dialogue shifts constantly between the two languages, often in midsentence, none of which is flagged in the English subtitles even though, like every cue in this subtlest of movies, each shift conveys meaning.Similarly, the film brings together two different, but intertwined and indeed interdependent, worlds. One is that of lites everywhere, but in this case of a post-putsch Latin American country among whom all are living in terror, though of what, or of whom, differs according to the person's social or political standing. The other is that of global private bankers, in this case Swiss, who provide vital services by protecting and processing wealth, whether gained by plunder by the current holders of power or inherited by established lites, presumably from plunder by their ancestors. Both worlds are scary, and their scariness is brilliantly conveyed, which is what makes this film so compelling. Though some of the in-jokes will be most amusing to Swiss viewers (outsiders will not necessarily spot the full contempt conveyed when one suave upper-class Swiss tells another that a third colleague is "from Zug"), the key structural role played by bankers worldwide in their dealings with the politically powerful and with the very rich, and the ways they help engineer mutations from one category to the other, could not be made clearer.Without resorting to spoilers, I think it can be said that what's most striking about the film's final sequence is the sudden banality of the message it appears to convey. After all that intrigue and complexity, you wonder, it this really what it was all about? And the film's answer appears to be, "Well, of course, what did you think?""

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11142762/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Umesh Bist shows potential with his socially relevant film ","I didn't have much interest in this film but it really surprised me.Pagglait follows Sandhya, a widow who grapples with an inability to grieve, quirky relatives and a startling discovery about her late husband.Umesh Bist doesn't have a great filmography but he does show potential with his latest venture, Pagglait. There are so many issues Bist wants to bring to our attention and I liked the way he handled them. There is a level of subtlety within the execution of the film and what it's trying to say which I appreciated. The film could have been overly dramatic in its presentation but Bist keeps the story, setting and its characters grounded at all times. It was interesting to see the mentality of a large family like this, how they would approach a situation like this and the way they act when money gets involved or when they get caught doing something they scold someone for doing. It's a nice social commentary that exposes the length some relatives would go to for their own benefit despite the sad situation.At the heart of this film we have Sandhya. Not only does Sanya Malhotra deliver a great performance as her but Bist uses this characater to say a lot about women in India. There are many characters in this film and, perhaps, may be too many. The large cast do a great job playing their roles but there were too many subplots involving them and got in the way of the main character's storyline. I wish more focus was given to Sandhya's character so that her arc felt more satisfying. The pacing is quite slow which may not work for some people.As a whole, Pagglait was an interesting film that you wouldn't normally see from India. The performances were great and conveyed a lot of issues present in India. I think Umesh Bist shows his worth as a writer and director and I'm intrigued to see what he comes up with next."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11142762/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," A breath of very fresh air and a deserving salute !! ","Pagglait is not only a breath of very fresh air, it is also a very different movie on many counts in comparison to the other movies on the OTT platform, that brings us the usual weekly dose of stories on either crime, sex or violence-laced with foul language. Pagglait starts off as a satirical-comedy drama, almost on a similar note as an Indian version of Death at a funeral, but changes gears brilliantly, thanks to its rich pool of its investment in its characters by director Umesh Bist. It deals with the story of a young widow trapped neck deep in the world of Patriarchy, Chauvinism, Emotional blackmail, out dated Traditions, middle class mindset amongst the paraphernalia of mourning, which forms the core storyline of Pagglait.Cinematography is excellent for an out to out indoor movie, the close ups were very good and consistent. A very interesting Screenplay based on simple day to day characters and a brilliant dose of black comedy opens a new dimension and keeps the storyline interesting throughout. Music by Arjit Singh contains some phenomenal songs, maybe the the best ever for an OTT release. Production design, costumes and makeup were all up to the mark. Maybe Editor could have cut pagglait to a 100 minute movie, but still at 115 minute runtime, the movie is not a drag by any means. Sanya Malhotra gives us another good performance, kudos to her ability to pick correct roles like Photograph, Pataka and Dangal. She is ably supported by a host of actors led by Asutosh Rana and Shruthi Sharma.Overall, The hidden beauty of this movie lies in the carefully crafted and very well defined characters, who each themselves deserve a review on their own. What struck me in the film was the ability to find humour in these dark morbid circumstances, It turns the glare on the hypocrisy that permeates our middle class lives, by saying one thing but to confining to stereotype, and societal norms, that are still holding strong, despite all our claims to modernity. Pagglait is an highly provocative film, that may not be suitable to certain sections of audiences, its an out and out a woman's film that takes patriarchy head on. 8 stars out out of 10 for this all round movie and a richly deserving salute to the Modern Indian woman and her desires."

It's entire cast is full of brilliant actors, so there is no complaint in acting. Good to see Shruti Sharma in a Hindi film after Agent Sai. Every dialogue is damm good. It's also the first music album by Arijit Singh as a composer and the songs are really nice.This film has everything which isn't accepted by our society. It shows us how a woman is controlled by a society. So, I think everyone should watch this specially women. It may encourage them.Available on Netflix. MandalBros."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11142762/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," Actual Rating : 7 ","I gave 10 because I saw some people crying in other reviews saying how Pagglait shows Hinduism as bad.It shows actual Hindu rituals. Why are you getting offended?And someone's offended that the cousins kiss. As if that never happens.Now about the movie. It had a good theme. It shows how actual people behave when someone dies in their family. Not everyone's genuinely sad. Some are sad to show others that they are sad. And so on.Sanya is excellent. I've always been a fan of her.But the movie is a bit overdramatic. The songs and background score aren't well suited. The story needed a better screenplay. It's the acting and DOP which saves the movie.Pagglait is a one time watch."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11142762/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," Brings out the Baffling Paradoxes in Indian Families !!! ","PAGGLAIT is a story of a young woman who gets widowed in just 5 months of her marriage and the movie covers the period of 13 Days of mourning of her husband's death. It might appear to be about one woman's journey towards independence, after she realizes how others have been taking decisions for her all her life.The writer - director Umesh Bist has really put commendable efforts by depicting the grand Indian family comprising of all brothers, uncles, aunts, cousins, grandmother and a very good friend (Shruti Sharma). The film has an assemble cast of very promising actors like Ashutosh Rana and others.This is a movie of moments. Moments that illuminate the families' hypocrisies and greed, propriety and self-absorption. The director treats his screenplay as a delightful juicer. He often squeezes and crushes the moments for maximum impact, zooming in so hard that a scene says a thousand words - sometimes more.Just enjoy this movie without even thinking twice. You will never feel bored in a single moment."

","I was not expecting much from this movie honestly but by the time I finished watching it, it had sprung so many awesome twists and surprises that it moved me. The movie has a mystical undertone from the very beginning and Santa Malhotra is totally a big part of it. She has evolved into this very mature actress who has no inhibitions whatsoever in front of the camera no matter what character she plays. The direction and script are spot on and not a single scene is disappointing in terms of what's going on and the presentation of it. Totally worth watching.

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11142762/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," ok movie but some disrespect to ancient traditoin ","Average movie...questioning of ancient culture tradition etc is ok but not by disrespecting them."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11142762/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," MUST WATCH !! ","This is the story of Sandhya Giri, a young woman widowed within few months after her arranged marriage. To the surprise of those around her, Sandhya is unable to grieve for her deceased husband as she finds that he was little more than a stranger to her. The story unfolds over the days when she along with the extended family go through the motions of last rites and picking up the pieces of their hitherto carefully ordered life. Sandhya embarks on an inner journey of discovery of her husband, his world & rediscovery of her own self, her priorities and purpose in life.Despite dealing with a dark and difficult theme, writer-director Umesh Bist succeeds in consistently mining sparkling humour from the morbid moments as well the muddle of the mundane household milieus (like the calling bell tunes) in equal measure and with effortless ease. Conversations suffused with sharp wit and impressive art direction create an authentic lived in feel of a house nestled in the bylanes of small town India.The movie benefits from the abundant talents of a top notch supporting cast consisting of a mix of dependable veterans like Ashutosh Rana, Sheeba Chaddha, Raghuveer Yadav, Rajesh Tailang, Sayani Gupta, Jameel Khan along with the rest of lesser known actors who excel in their respective parts. Ashutosh Rana and Sheeba Chaddha are exceptional as the grieving parents smouldering in sorrow after their catastrophic loss and trying to get a grip on their chaotic reality.Nevertheless, the movie belongs to Sanya Malhotra who is spectacular as she gets into the skin of her character of Sandhya Giri and owns it completely. This is a superlative performance as she manages to effortlessly navigate between moments of morose loss and mirth and is sure to establish her as an actor par excellence.Umesh Bist's writing strikes a subtle balance at multiple levels - adding healthy doses of humour while avoiding caricatures; has its share of poignant moments without descending into loud melodrama; manages to capture the complex dynamics of an extended family without creating any evil villains. While Pagglait might share some resonance with Vikas Bahl's Queen, I reckon it is a bigger challenge to pull off and director Umesh Bist deserves kudos for his deft handling of this difficult theme.MUST WATCH !!RATING - 4/5."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11142762/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," A tricky film in terms of tone and plot ","Pagglait is probably an ambitious writing experiment but fails in execution.It is a film whose central theme is grief and how all the characters cope with it. But having said that it has an amalgamation of more than one half baked sub plots. There are characters which seems promising at first but leaves you desiring for more.This film seems like written as a comedy but got directed as a melancholic drama. This tonal incoherence is apparent when the dialogues are not matching with the situations presented on screen. More so, the supposed nuanced characters turns out to be surprisingly one dimensional. For a film that is entirely based on Malhotra's character apparently has too many characters written for supporting. So much so, that you have these some of the most prolific actors, capable of playing so versatile characters, are just uttering monotonous and repetitive lines.Rana and Chaddha are just mute and grieving parents. Sayani Gupta has just guilt on her face. The young brother in law is just complaining and yet the one fulfilling his duties. There is no character arc.In terms of performance, Malhotra is the only one who shines. Her performance is conflicted, yet grieving.A decent watch. Can be skipped."

","It's a commentary on human behavior, relationships, the plight that women still have to go through in some parts of India, (thanks to some of our age old traditions), subtle bias based on religion, the irony in various situations, a widow as a commodity, and I can go on. A LOT of things subtly packed in about 2 hours.Sanya Malhotra plays Sandhya well, and so does the rest of the cast. There are two 'songs' which are more like poems for the situation.The trailer was slightly misleading as it said "Go crazy and find yourself" and IMO, there was nothing crazy in the movie. Either that, or normal human behavior can sometimes be considered crazy by the elders in our society, in which case, I get it...? The movie is predictable but is a casual watch, its nothing heavy but at the same time, has deep meaning.Would ask that you give it a chance because...it's 2021 and we shouldn't be getting to watching these stories unless they're a period drama from ages ago.

(When tea is made for all, she wants Pepsi instead ). This upsets her orthodox in laws ( Sheeba Chaddha and Ashutosh Rana) and other relatives who have gathered for the teherveen ( thirteenth day Hindu death ceremony). The father Ashutosh having used up his money to stabilize his son is now financially down and the future is bleak for him. This is the scenario of this simple film.Director Umesh Bist ( also story/ dialogue) has made an interesting film based on middle class sensibilities and how orthodox values clash with modern approach to life. (When the teenage girl states that her bhabhi uses sanitary pads and can't be pregnant, old timer Raghuvir Yadav sarcastically says " Aur dikhao, Padman".) Each member of the family has got his /her agenda to accomplish during the 13 days and the sombre ceremony takes a backseat. Sanya tells her parents that the toilet doesn't have western seat and they will have problems during the stay. Plans get made when they find out that Sanya stands to gain Rs 50 lakhs insurance money and this makes her a potential bride in remarriage.The film has some good acting by Sanya, Sheena and Ashutosh which makes the film watchable.
