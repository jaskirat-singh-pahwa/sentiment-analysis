","Decades ago Hasari Pal(OmPuri) from the 'City of Joy' had depicted the plight of the Rickshawalas so meticulously and a similar method acting by Avinash Dwivedi in the movie Rickshawala directed by one of the path breaking directors of the current time, Ram Kamal Mukherjee. The sensitivity with which the present lifestyle of the Rickshawala is presented speaks volumes about the vision and honesty of the director. There was equal amount of sincerity with which the nuances of the body language and diction was portrayed by the lead actor Avinash. Not much has changed in terms of the beleaguering poverty in which they live and the declaration by the Supreme Court as illegal has only worsened their struggle of survival. Beautifully supported by the rest of the cast and admirable cinematography by Modhura Palit its a must watch for people who look for great content in films."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10928086/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Tense performance ","After leaving a tragic accident - the film begins with our heroine embracing her girlfriend who runs into the water and is never seen again - and a stay at the mental hospital, Molly moves into a new apartment where a strange knocking keeps on getting louder and louder. No one else can hear it. And it's not going away.Adapted from a novel by Johan Theorin, this movie lives and dies by the intense performance of lead Cecilia Milocco and the so tight you're face-to-face cinematography of Hannes Krantz. The tension keeps increasing and much like so many "is it supernatural or mental illness" movies, the questions keep increasing as Molly begins taking increasing risks to determine where the knocking and sobbing is coming from.At just 78 minutes, this is a short film that nearly begs for even more time and it's rare that I feel that way. The end just arrives after the slowest of builds, but I've been obsessed with the moments that exist between waiting for something to happen and the actual second that everything changes."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10928086/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Cliche But Entertaining Enough ","Knocking is about a woman who leaves a psychiatric ward after a nervous breakdown, but she soon begins hearing mysterious knocking sounds in her apartment. Of course, any midnight horror movie is going to catch my attention and this happened to be one of the ones I really wanted to see. Unfortunately, it didn't live up to what I wanted it to be. Knocking follows a typical indie slow-burn about someone who may or may not be crazy. The movie tries to play smart, but we're all immune to any shock factor that comes our way. Everything is something we've seen before, yet I still found the movie entertaining. Cecilia Milocco gives a good performance that drives the whole thing. We know her history in mental health and an event that has scarred her which is fine for character development. My issue is because we know this, the whole time we're thinking she's crazy and hearing this. The end does play around with us leaving an ambiguous answer. For a 78-minute runtime it didn't feel all there, but maybe as a short this would've worked wonders. It's serviceable but nothing too special."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10928086/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," If you have a spare hour or so . . . ","Go out and do something or find someone else to watch.Long drawn out nonsense that started nowhere and went even further away.I slept like a baby after watching though."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10928086/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," Psychological thriller with no surprises ","A psychological thriller that is handled with a certain suspense, although from the visual point of view it does not have bright ideas. The story benefits from an adequate length (short film based on a short story), although it gives the impression that the path takes us not very far from where we were at the beginning. Good performing by Cecilia Milocco, which is above the predictability of the story."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10928086/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," I quite liked it. ","Great performance from the lead. I felt her fear and anxiety the entire runtime. My wife and I were both felt so stressed and empathetic to the protagonists suffering.After sitting with the ending overnight, I also really enjoyed it. It leaves me feeling happy, oddly enough.Perhaps my favorite horror from Sundance? Censor was good too.Give it a watch and stress out with our hero!"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10928086/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," An impressive debut and a breathtaking performance from the lead actress! ","This film is a must see! A solid thriller drama with breathtaking acting from Cecilia Milocco. The story is rather simple in one sense. It follows Molly, a women coming home from a psychriatic clinic after dealing with the loss of her girlfriend. Back home she hears noises, knockings, in the walls and ceiling. It sounds like a woman in pain. It drives Molly to investigate where the sounds comes from but no one believes her conviction that a women in the building is getting hurt. This is the setting for this drama taking place in the suburbs somewhere in Sweden. But the big sucess of this film is not a smart plot or a who-done-it-mystery for the viewer to solve. Its the brilliantly performed emotional journey of Molly and the bold storytelling of relying in the moods and senses of the lead role that makes this a magnificent debut film from Frida Kempff. The visionary camerawork is highly emotionally driven and the script makes plenty of room for both moods and tensions far beyond the written dialogue. The movies core is the suggestive and subjective experience of loneliness and the effects of not being heard. In that sense, this movie suceed of being both a deeply moving drama and a thriller full of suspense. Cecilia Miloccos moving potrayal of Molly, a women struggling with sorrow and depression is masterly performed and makes this film a masterpiece."

And they've made a lot of mistakes. For example, they shot a car like a hundred times but not a single window broke, etc.I had a great time, don't get me wrong, camera work is great, score is better in this one(although soundtrack from first film is and always will be much more iconic) and the "plot twist".... I really didn't see that coming. BUT, during the second part of the movie, I could always feel something is missing.Plus, the movie didn't had ending. It ended like a TV episode that we have to wait next week to see.Overall a solid ride, you'll probably enjoy it.Solid 6/10, but because of a "twist" I have to give it an 8."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10944596/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," two interesting leads ","Veteran comedy writer Charlie Burnz (Billy Crystal) is suffering dementia. He has moments when he forgets his closest relations. He has a lunch date with Emma Payge (Tiffany Haddish). Her ex had purchased the lunch at an auction for $22. She notices his difficulty despite trying to hide it from everybody. The two becomes best friends as he deteriorates.There are some moments of interest and these are two interesting leads. However, sometimes this movie throws in some questionable stuff into the mix. It starts right away with the shellfish allergy. It's obvious that they thought this movie needs some broad physical comedy right away to set a tone. Only it's the wrong tone. It's so much better for some easy back and forth dialogue between Crystal and Haddish. These are two sharp minds and their exchanges have their energy. The shellfish idea is silly to start with and the allergy makes it worst. At most, it shows Charlie's generosity and gives a reason for Emma to keep returning to him. There has to be a better way to show these things. As much as I love the chemistry, this movie keeps taking awkward little turns like Emma spooning Charlie. I don't know any adult doing that due to a storm fear. Imagine a better way. What if Charlie is having a disturbing nightmare and Emma comes in to comfort him? It's not as awkwardly broad and more emotionally satisfying. This movie has two appealing leads and a solid indie story. This land just needs someone to clear out some of under brush. For example, the incredibly single skit is not funny and it's certainly not funny enough to do what it's supposed to do."

Billy Crystal stars as a comedy writer who works on an incredibly unfunny cable TV sketch comedy show that ads tell us is #1. He has dementia but drugs are enabling him to function. He meets a woman (Tiffany Haddish) who won a raffle to have lunch with him. They form an unlikely friendship.Much of the film entails flashbacks that show us his life with his wife from 40 years ago. He's sort of a Neil Simon writer with hit movies and Broadway plays but he's been writing for this lame SNL clone for decades. He's hidden his dementia from his kids and they are resentful of his friendship with the younger woman. And that's about it. The last third of the film turns maudlin as Crystal gets the expected bad news and we go all sticky goopy.Crystal is fine (and co-wrote the script) but Haddish is a bit much at times. Supporting cast is unremarkable as are cameos by Sharon Stone and Kevin Kline.There's a brief look at a photoshopped picture of comedy legends Imogene Coca, Sid Caesar, Carl Reiner, and Howard with Crystal added in, supposedly from his early writing days.

Billy plays an older comedy writer for a tv show. He meets Tiffany, a street singer, for a lunch date-it was supposed to be her boyfriend who had won it in a contest but he couldn't make it-and their relationship begins. Tiffanys' and her boyfriends' ends. Billy & Tiffany become good friends but they are not romantically involved. Laura & Penn are Billy's kids, who both have issues with Billy so they don't speak to him very often. Billy's wife died several years earlier and Billy is beginning to have dementia. Both Billy & Tiffany are funny but the later half of the movie gets into the tear jerking department. There are several cameos; I remember seeing Barry Levinson, Kevin Kline & Sharon Stone in brief parts.It's rated "PG-13" for language & sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour &57 minutes.It's not one that I would buy on DVD.

It proves that different ages can't stop friendship and makes us believe in love and trust.There are quite a few amazing things in this film. At the very beginning there is a scene where Charlie is walking all the way to his work. This scene is important because Charlie has Dementia and can't always remember things, so he needs a route with familiar markers so he knows where he is going. This comes into play later when there is a scene where he is told to take a detour and he doesn't know how to get to work that day because he is told to take a different route. There is a church scene with lots of people, which was impressive. The amount of extras needed to make that scene would be tremendous. There are also flashbacks and scenes where we see the past when Charlie is writing. I love the location near the end when they are in a forest. These scenes look like a dream, and their clarity impressed me. One of my favorite scenes is when the company Charlie works for is making a news report and Charlie comes in and says the guy hosting the show is saying all the words wrong and Charlie makes an unintentional comedic remark.The message of this film is that friendship and love can topple all. Parents should know that there are some inappropriate scenes such as a scene where they stick an epipen in and do it wrong and Emma has an allergic reaction she looks kind of creepy which might scare some kids and some profanity.I give Here Today 3 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 14 to 18, plus adults.

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10944596/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," 90's cable movie ","509. Here Today. Directed by, written by and starring Billy Crystal, tells the coming-of-old age story of Charlie Burns, a famous writer, who is now suffering from dementia and all the fun that seems to entail. It feels like this was probably a labor of love or a passion project for Billy Crystal, however, to me it felt like a 1990's cable movie, with Crystal in old man make-up and more than likely Queen Latifah co-starring, maybe even Woody Allen doing the Charlie role. Main story is this, Charlie is meeting someone for dinner, a fan, who won the chance to meet Charlie at a charity. Instead, the fan's ex-girlfriend Emma, played by Tiffany Haddish shows up, cause well she's getting even. She's loud, over the top and funny compared to Charlie's quiet and subdued manner, remember that 90's vibe I was talking about? Well, there it is. At dinner, Emma orders enough seafood to feed a small nation, seafood that she is also allergic too, which results in face swelling hijinks and a trip to the hospital. And this incident locks the two in a close, kind of unbelievable friendship that only really happens in movies. First half of the movie is decent, has some laughs. Second half, kind of fell apart for me. Felt it rushed in all the family drama stuff to fast and all at once, and it just lacked believability, I honestly thought at one point Emma was a figment of Charlie's imagination and he probably did something awful to her in the past, it just had that vibe to it. Well, that's just my opinion. Tiffany Haddish is really funny in it and performs some great songs in it. Although her flirting with 70+ year old's while singing Janis Joplin's 'Piece of my Heart' at Charlie's nieces bar mitzvah was a little odd, but oh well. It wasn't awful, it just wasn't anywhere near great either. It'll be on Lifetime soon..."

This film is like spending two hours with an old friend. With that being said, the film is quite good in parts, but the sum parts don't add up to a great film.Crystal plays a comedy writer who is experiencing the beginning stages of dementia. He keeps this from his family and tries his best to hide it from everyone at work. Tiffany Haddish plays a woman who cashed in on an auction her ex boyfriend won to have lunch with the famous writer. This is despite not knowing who he is and ultimately insulting him frequently. She addresses him as "old man." To make matters worse, a food allergy lands her in the hospital and Crystal gets stuck with the bill. Oddly, a close friendship develops.Haddish's initial over the top characterization of this woman is ill conceived. We later learn that she is some sort of jazz subway singer. She eventually becomes the voice of reason for Crystal and a major player In his life. But through it all, she never quite becomes a cohesive believable character.Flashbacks are frequent as Crystal imagines his deceased wife. These are always awkward as the wife seems to be the exact same age in every flashback and Crystal's voice is only heard.The film has some touching moments and the relationship between Haddish and Crystal does evolve into a sweet friendship. But the schmaltzy moments between Crystal and his family toward the end detracted from their story. The film needed more focus as it tried to cover too much ground in 2 hours.This is a review so I'm nitpicking. Overall, I did enjoy the film and especially Billy Crystal's fine performance. I believe most audience members will too."

This movie was trying SO DESPERATELY to be a tear-jerker, I felt seriously manipulated as the viewer.The writing was awful...NOT FUNNY...okay, maybe a few little teeny tiny chuckles here and there. But overall....just not funny. Way too fake and clich and unfathomable!Nobody (except for this person Charley Burnz...i.e. Billy Crystal's character hardly even knows and his doctor) notices his dementia problem? That's a bit hard to swallow.The comedy "bits" in the movie are like the opposite of funny...there should be a word for that, because that word would be very appropriate for this review. Billy Crystal comes off as sad and depressing in this film (what ever happened to the Billy Crystal from Analyze this, and City Slickers)? His character is also sad and depressing, constantly living in the past.And this woman he befriends? Please! She's so harsh and irritating. The writing for this movie seems so formulaic and unsophisticated. I didn't feel any real "spark" between the characters and the scenes with Charlie's dead wife are THE WORST! So phony and so much over-acting, I wanted to fast forward through all of them.Would I recommend this movie? I think the answer is obvious...unless you enjoy fake soapy cheesy maudlin tear-jerkers. Fake, fake, fake. Blech! I used to like Billy Crystal. When Harry Meets Sally? One of the best movies ever, because the relationship in that movie seemed "real."But now I'm not sure if I'll ever watch another Billy Crystal movie again, and that's real sad...not fake sad."

She masquerades as a missing boy and reunites with the boy's father Vincent (Vincent Lindon) who takes her in as the boy.This is one strange film. It's a French body horror. It starts like a damaged girl gone bad. It has a bit of Crash, the good Cronenberg movie not the other one. It gets surreal and then it gets weird. It gets confused. It gets weirder and then it gets extremely weird with the body horror. It's doing stuff with toxic masculinity and body image and sexuality and self-denial and... and... and...

Which I just did."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10944760/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Not a titanic movie, but a trunk filled with appeal that comes through its strangeness, a bit like a 21st-century Christine ","France's Oscar sumbission "Titane" is a pretty new French/Belgian movie in the French language that was released here not too long ago. What got me curious about it mostly except my francophilia and that I am always curious about new French films was that this won the prestigious Palme d'Or in Cannes this year. Now after watching I wonder why though. I mean it's not a bad film or anything, but also not too great and I don't know maybe it helped them that a female filmmaker was in charge, that a woman was posing as a guy for large parts of the film and also simply how strange it all was. I mean the one thing that this film certainly is is different. The director is Julia Ducournau and she is also the writer here, actually the only writer if we do not count the two consultants. According to imdb, Ducournau has been making films now for a decade and it's maybe gonna be a close fight between this one and Grave when it comes to the question what film of hers is most famous. We will have to wait and see how much people will be going for these almost 110 minutes. In Grave, the lead actress is Garance Marillier and Ducournau has worked with her a few times already, so no surprise that Marillier is also in here, even if not in the lead this time, but instead playing a character that does not have a huge amount of screen time and is not featured in the second half at all. Well, I guess Ducournau thought that lead actress Agathe Rousselle (surprised she received zero awards recognition) was more fitting for the part here, especially in terms of being able to portray cold-blooded, but also with pretty much the entire second half, they also needed a lead that could be mistaken for a young man to some extent. So Rousselle got the part eventually and to me personally she looked a bit like the young Uma Thurman (and August Diehl) and there was definitely a touch of Tarantino to this film in the first hour, especially in these scenes that mixed violence with music.The second half was completely different though. A few words on the key plot now: We have a young girl in the prologue or something and she is in a terrible car accident with her father after she annoys him and he looks briefly away from the street to make her stop. Daddy is unharmed, but little Alexia's blood we see from afar and there is emergency surgery and we find out she has to carry a piece of metal now in her head. And that makes something with her. By the way, after the surgery we see them ask a few questions to a doctor and said doctor is also the only one to mention titanium in this movie by saying the exact word. Or saying "titane" in the original version of course, even if this title is as much of a reference to what you could call the protagonist as it is to the metal. The scene that follows when they leave the hospital for my liking could have needed some more subtlety perhaps. I mean I would have believed the girl to be really confused and in pain maybe as it was not a long time after the surgery, but her running out and hugging the car, even kissing it was of course some foreshadowing, but still too much in-your-face I thought. Then again, this film was in-your-face on many other occasions as well, but there it usually worked better. This of course refers very much to the scenes that I mentioned earlier already, very violent scenes at times. The first killing is still somewhat justified because she really was harrassed and attacked by the stalker and sexual assault could have followed this molestation, even if it was still very bloody what she did with the needle in her hair. This needle also becomes a bit of her weapon as the film moves on and she is genuinely worried when somebody took it from her early in the second half.But before we move to that, a few more words on the second killing: That was a bit of an orgy already. She kills her (potential) girlfriend first, then several other people show up and she takes pretty much care of them one-by-one. Only one girl somehow manages to find a way to run. That girl was not the one played by Marillier. She is the first victim in this scene. With the music running. Music that does not evoke tragedy, but is almost playful and joyful. And as tragic as this scene may have been, there was also some dark comedy to it when she moans and complains about how many more there are that she has to kill, so they cannot identify her or something. One of really not many comedic moments at all. The one other slightly funny scene that comes to mind was pretty brief too, namely when we find out about a male character talking about how he is God to a group of young men and how that makes the title character Jesus. That was funny because of how exaggerated it was. So now we are in the middle of the second half already. This half includes less violence for sure. Nobody is really killed, we only see two very minor characters struggling with their health and there the title character is more of a savior even than a murderer. This scene also made something with her and made her bond with Lindon's character even stronger. Yep, Vincent Lindon is in this film. People from France who love movies will recognize him immediately. He is always easy to identify. He is even first credit here on imdb, but he shouldn't be. I mean his presence in the second half of the film makes it possible to consider him a co-lead, even if it's a really close call. Alexia is 100% number one. He plays a character whose son disappeared many years ago and our title character decides to pose as said son and pretend he has returned. Of course also because she must make sure to get away from police and find a safe haven somewhere. I must say this general idea how he really accepts her as his son and she kinda knew he would seemed a bit much and not too realistic, even if it is easy to understand he was so desperate that he would have accepted anybody probably slightly resembling what his son would look like in the now.So the introduction and general idea behind this twist did not make too much sense to me, but all that followed was better. This includes the way how she is treated disrespectfully by one younger character especially because he quickly realizes something's wrong and also calls her "she" during the final stages of the movie. But it also includes the relationship between Alexia and Lindon's character. How at some point he just cannot close his eyes anymore to the fact that she is not his son and also tells others to not talk about this alleged son anymore. When he sees that she is a woman at the very end, he is not surprised. It seems as if he takes whatever he can to be close to his son. Even if it just an illusion. This was nicely handled overall and among the film's better aspects. It was also telling how the movie kept playing with us in terms of how Lindon's character could be about to die. Be it from an overdose. Be it when he catches fire. Be it when the music plays, but he started it. Be it when he is unconscious and Titane thinks she is ready to kill him. In fact she isn't because she knows that his love for his child is infinite and that he is a good father and also that she enjoys being taken care of like this from her dad. From her "dad". Because her real father, the man we see on several occasions early on, also in the car, was the opposite of loving when it comes to how he treated his daughter. And in Lindon's character, she found this paternal love she would have loved to receive from her biological dad. So it is also a family drama to some extent, even if she does not kill her father or anything.Now, I shall elaborate a little more on the metal aspects here. I already mentioned the car hugging almost at the beginning, but there is way more in fact. Our protagonist gets pregnant at some point and we could have guessed that it happened during the sex scene she had inside a car. With the automobile. Yep! The father of her unborn is really the car. This may sound absurd and gimmicky, but the way it was portrayed, it somehow felt credible. Still this makes it a fantasy film or science fiction film or whatever and this idea is really where the film cannot be called realistic whatsoever anymore. Especially if you take into account that she was bleeding occasionally because of the pregnancy, but it was not blood that came out. It was motor oil if I was not mistaken. At least, it was really dark, black pretty much. We could not smell it in the theater of course to be sure, but it looked like motor oil. In the end, there is the birth scene and that I did not like too much again. Or the scene was okay, but the outcome well with a human baby that has lots of metal in its back. Looked like a zip (fastener) pretty much instead of a spine or something and there was metal on the baby's head too. Well, daddy was an automotive, so what can you say? The moment with Lindon holding the baby and him alive and her gone, which you really could not expect, was pretty good again though. Maybe I liked the way the circle closes there also because of his own vanished son and now he holds a "new" son in his hands. So the last shot leaves an impression . Other than that, maybe because of how much I like Marillier, I must also mention all the nude scenes in the first half, no matter if we are talking showering or erotic affection, but yeah with the protagonist's soft spot for metal, a nipple piercing is maybe nothing you would want to show her. Otherwise, things could get a bit painful. And they do here and there when the oral nuzzling becomes a bit too wild. Watch for yourself. And if you are a girl, be prepared to scream like one female in my showing because she could feel Marillier's pain in two scenes. In general, not only lots of violence, but lots of nudity here. This is a film for adult audiences. Mostly enjoyable, but real greatness I don't see with it. The fascination really comes mostly from how bizarre it all is. (tt10944760)"

Something the movie does occasionally. Something that takes the term "car lover" to a whole new level. And it has things that you cannot possibly explain ... in the real world. With a main character who has quite the issues. Her introduction alone is ... well more than note-worthy. She is being annoying to say the least - poor father.And then you feel sorry for her ... until you realize ... maybe you shouldn't. Or maybe you should - because for every broken character, there is another broken character who might be the piece of the puzzle that is missing, to make them complete.There are many things here that are not spoken out aloud. But we know ... we know because while you could say they are subtle ... we know! And the characters know too! We know what happened to a boy that is "missing" for 10 years ... we are shown what happened to him. It is not said - and it is not necessary for anyone to actually spell it out.We know that in the scene in the woods/forest ... well actually we do not know if or to what degree that was "planned" ... an accident. But we know or rather expect it to happen. Not much is being said in the aftermath about it.There is so much to unpack here ... and I haven't even touched the surface - no pun intended. You know what I mean if you've seen the movie. Touching that subject of service: a lot of nudity in this one. And a lot of scenes that may cause you to feel sick. The scenes are sick, they are meant to provoke a reaction out of you. But they are also always topped off with a touch of comedy (relief).Now you may think I'm mad saying that, considering certain things that happen - and in the real world I would agree that it would be hard to see any "fun" in things that happen here ... but this is a movie. And our main character is not a heroine! No the movie makes it clear - she is almost derived of a moral compass.This is a crazy movie for sure - the question is, if you are up for it. If you can dig the broken characters in this - and stay detached but also invested in the fate of those involved ... I know, but if you go with the flow ... well what a great movie to see."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10944760/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Car shaking wildness ","Coming five years after Raw, Julia Ducournau's Titante (Titanium) is also Croenenberg-inspired but goes in its own direction. Or plenty of directions, to be perfectly honest.When she was a child, Alexia was in a car accident that she caused by distracting her father. After years of painful surgeries, she's grown into a woman (Agathe Rousselle) who wants nothing to do with her parents - despite living with them - and makes her living as a motor show salesgirl, writhing provocatively atop a car that us so moved by the experience that it makes love to her after she's killed a man with her hatpin.Yes, you read that right.Alexia is also a serial killer who has a history of wiping out her human lovers. But the one thing she can't kill is the new life inside her. After a victim escapes, she sets her parents house ablaze with them inside and reacts to being a wanted woman by assuming the identity of Adrien, a lost boy, by repeatedly breaking her nose and transforming her body by duct tape to take on a male appearance.The boy's father Vincent (Vincent Lindon), a steroid-addicted firefighter, doesn't need a DNA test. Obviously, this is his son, returned from wherever he was, and he will now protect him as he didn't before. Let the other firefighters discuss the mute and androgynous and obvious damaged "son" that is part of their crew; the captain is respected enough that everyone understands the loss he's endured. Even his ex-wife, later in the film, who discovers that Adrien is Alexia.Despite all evidence to the contrary, Vincent still believes that this is his son, even after he begins dripping motor oil and displaying a mechanical endoskeleton and bursting from whatever is growing within him or her.The winner of the Palme d'Or at this year's Cannes Film Festival, Titane won't be for everyone. Just like the titanium structure holding together its protagonist's skull, it threatens to break at any time but holds together by sheer force of will and the tenacity of lead Agathe Rousselle, who plays her as the most seductive and most frightening woman of all time seemingly in the same scene, appearing to be heartbreakingly gorgeous and near-death also within seconds of one another.This is a film of juxtaposition, of the real and unreal. Beyond becoming a fake person, its lead is a horror movie cipher, a mechanical woman willing to become a man but to never stop seducing and destroying because that's all she or he knows, the only tenderness to be found in the backseats of cars all alone as they jump and flash their lights into the too dark night. Meanwhile, Vincent is a very real character, a man whose strength has defined his life but is escaping him, a person who would rather accept the fake story that his son has returned than to accept that what he loves - and has recreated numerous times through the firemen who are the missing child's surrogates - is gone forever.Also: puke, black oil coming out of orifices, hatpin murders and dancing atop firetrucks."

Eventually she has to pay the price of her killing by bring a new life to the world before pegging out, which fortuitously can fill Vincent's void. This arrangement, conceived by Ducournau to tone down her provocation, is self-defeating. When all is said and done, Alexia cannot escape her biological function as a mother (even dies for it) and Vincent is richly rewarded for his compassion and liberality. Neither his steroids-injecting attempt to defy age nor his abortive attempt to make Alessia man up is spurned, the impression is that, Vincent is represented as the role model of a middle-aged, traditionally masculine, defeated white male, and TITANE shows how he should react according to today's changed ethos. But Ducournau doesn't seem to understand, seldom a film works with such loud, tailored exhortation.

Bold, beautiful & bewildering, Titane is the latest offering from a singularly audacious new filmmaker and it is delightfully deranged.Written & directed by Julia Ducournau, her sophomore feature makes her directorial debut look tame in regards to its uncompromising vision & provocative power. Led by a smashing performance from debutante Agathe Rousselle, the plot concerns two characters who find their missing pieces in each other's voids and though visceral & uncomfortable at all times, the film never discards its heart or humanity.Adding to its alluring quality & bizarre nature is the aggressive camerawork, charged visual flourishes, sensory sound & hypnotic soundtrack. Throughout its 108 mins runtime, the film sheds old skin to embrace new contours and even though its structure & presentation is all over the place, it does find & retains emotional coherency in the characters' unfolding arcs, deftly rendered by both Rousselle & Vincent Lindon.Overall, Titane is an original, ambitious & refreshing delight that fascinates & frustrates in equal measure and more than lives up to the designated tag of "the most shocking film of 2021". A mashup of several genres that aptly juggles intimacy with violence, brutality with kindness, shock with awe & flesh with metal while making for a wickedly gripping study of gender fluidity, Ducournau's latest establishes her as a creative powerhouse."

We then move to today, and grown-up Alexia is dancing in a club featuring slick cars and where "touching is done with the eyes only". Late one night, Alexia gets into that sleek Cadillac, where she is twisted and twirled, naked. It's not long before she finds out that somehow she is pregnant... To tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the second feature-length film from French writer-director Julia Ducourneau, who seduced us a couple of years ago with "Raw". Here she examines the impossible, namely what if a car somehow impregnates a women? It is the beginning of a long, strange journey into the fantastical. The less I say about the plot, the better. I will simply comment that the movie's ultimate direction is completely unexpected. To be clear: yes, there are a LOT of shocking scenes (I covered my eyes on a number of occasions) but look beyond all of the shock and gore, and it turns out this movie is about a love story unlike any you have ever seen, I am quite certain. I will readily admit that this movie pushed me out of my comfort zone, in the best possible way. None of this would be possible without the originality of director Julia Ducourneau. Where she dreams this stuff up, I have no idea. But the movie industry should be very thankful for someone like her. Kudos as well to Agathe Rousselle, who brings an amazing and bold lead performance as Alexia. Veteran French actor Vincent Lindon does quite well too. (Please note: there is a LOT of nudity in the film, so if that would bother you, please stay away from this film.)"Titane" premiered at this year's Cannes Film Festival, where it promptly won THE top price (Palme d'Or). The movie was released in select US theaters this past weekend, and i couldn't wait to see it. The early Monday evening screening where I saw this at my local arthouse theater here in Cincinnati was not attended well (4 people in total including myself). It's very obvious that this movie isn't for everyone. But if you are in the mood for a top-notch foreign film that may well push you out of your comfort zone, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theatre (while you still can), on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10944760/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Strange ","Agathe Rousselle stars as a woman who has survived a car crash and has a titanium plate in her head. She works at car shows and somehow becomes involved in an intimate way with a Cadillac. Later on, she becomes the "son" of a bereaved father whose son has been missing for years. The violence and nudity are frequent and Agathe is the main reason for watching the film. She is a perfect choice for the role. The directors previous movie was "Raw," another bloody mess. I am surprised that a woman made Titane. So much for the fairer sex."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10944760/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," WHAT JUST HAPPENED? ","It's very dark and weirder than I was expecting. All the roles were well acted but it would have been nice to get a little more back story on main character's motivations."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10944760/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," A bold and twisted "French" film ","American cinema can be a bore. As a society, we tend to overly focus on logic, writing, and pacing when it comes to great film. When it comes to the awful films, we focus on lousy production value, plot holes, incoherent writing and poorly realized characters. Everything is handed to us on a plate to pick and choose. We can delight in the simple nacho bowl of never ending sequels and franchises or indulge in the charcuterie board of an occasional Oscar contender. And then you have a film like Titane.Titane is like a wheel that just spilled its ball bearings all over the floor. You have to reach in certain places to find the balls and even pontificate where they might have rolled to. It's time consuming, difficult and makes you want to say "to heck with this" and get a new wheel at ACE Hardware. Such is the twisted mastery that is this vivid and outlandish film.Julia Ducournau continues to make the statement that we should give women more projects in the film world. Her version of France feels dirtier and grimier than most, even when it is bathed in neon lights. It's a statement toward the current trends, that she will twist them with more perverse and dangerous themes.We start the story with Alexia, who is on the run due to being a serial killer. She decides to impersonate a man that has been missing for years, but little does she know the father of the lost boy is as damaged as she is. If anything, Alexia's relationship with Vincent is a culmination of stress reaction to trauma. Alexia fetishizes and "makes love" to vehicles due to an accident she has in her youth. This leaves her with brain damage and possibly the source of her violence. Vincent lost his son after he apparently ran away, most likely due to the controlling and egomaniacal tendencies Vincent displays. Vincent battles time and a slowly dying body with testosterone in hopes he can reclaim his manhood that he lost when his son ran away and his wife unceremoniously left him.There is a lot to unpack. The film takes on complicated subjects like gender fluidity, possibly gender dysphoria, sexual fluidity, the male ego, homoeroticism in hyper masculine professions, technological encroachment and the dissipation of the traditional family unit. And then there is that ending. Phew.This is not an easy watch, even for people exposed to this cinema. If you like the neatly packaged and arranged simplicity of the common American cinema, this will not be for you. If you do like being challenged, then check this out."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10944760/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Good Follow-up Film for Ducournau ","This was a movie that when I saw it was coming to the Gateway Film Center, I was intrigued. I enjoyed the director's previous film of Raw and this one was getting buzz from groups I'm a part of on social media. Figured since this is a 2021 film, I'd give this a go. The synopsis is following a series of unexplained crimes, a father is reunited with the son who has been missing for 10 years.We start this movie off Alexia (Adle Guigue) when she is age 7. Her father is driving, played by Bertrand Bonello, and he is annoyed with Alexia. She is mimicking the sound of the engine. To ignore her, the father turns up the radio, but this causes Alexia to get louder. She then takes off her seatbelt and her father tries to stop her, causing an accident. Alexia has a metal plate put in her head and a brace she had to wear as a result.The movie then shifts into the present where Alexia is now portrayed by Agathe Rousselle. She works as a model at a car show. These women here show off their bodies and men can be a bit touchy. Alexia is dancing in front of a Cadillac with painted flames on it. After the show ends she makes friends with another woman in the shower, Justine (Garance Marillier). Alexia heads to her car and is chased by a fan. He wants an autograph, which she agrees to in order to get him to leave. When he asks for a kiss, she obliges and stabs him in the ear with her hairpin.She goes back inside to shower again and she hears loud banging coming from the showroom. She is naked and dripping wet when gets into the car she modeled on. Alexia is turned on and gets off while in the backseat. We are seeing the car bouncing up and down as she does.From here we get the idea that Alexia is a bit off. She lounges about the house most of the day. Her father doesn't seem to like to be around her and her mother, Cline Carrre, loves her. We see some horrific events though that causes her to flee. The police are looking for her and she decides to disguise herself as Adrien, a missing boy we heard about on the news. This boy's father comes, Vincent (Vincent Lindon), believing she is his son.There are some deep seeded issues there. It is a rough go at first, but Alexia settles into who she is pretending to be. Those around Vincent don't believe she is Adrien though. Alexia has a much bigger problem that is growing in her stomach.That is where I'm going to leave my recap as I did leave out some important aspects as to not spoil them for anyone reading this. Where I'll start is that I came in with as much of a blank slate as I could for this movie. I knew that I loved Raw and that people I follow had seen this movie. It was getting high praise. I was excited, but I also didn't know what to expect.Where I want to start then would be the character of Alexia. I'm thinking there must be autism or some sort of personality disorder here. As a child, she is annoying on purpose. This could be that she is a sociopath as well. She wants to aggravate her dad. Needing to have the plate in her head and the scar on the side of her head that it caused, I think has a profound effect on her and for what happens later. I did hear some people stating that this is a take on David Cronenberg's Crash. I don't feel that is the case aside from Alexia having a fetish for this car, machinery and being body horror.That is where I'm going to go next, the body horror aspects. For some reason in my head, I wasn't expecting. I've brought up writer/director Ducournau's previous film so I should have been ready. There were multiple scenes that made me cringe with how realistic they look. I was joined by around ten other people. I could see many of them with the same reaction as myself. The effects are something that I should give credit to here. It is interesting that this is being compared to Crash, because I'd put both of Ducournau's films on par with Cronenberg for grounded body horror. The effects looked practical and were great. There was some CGI as well, but I didn't have problems there.Getting back to the story, there is an aspect of this movie I haven't covered. There is a serial killer that is killing in the area. It appears there have been four bodies found over the course of a year. This is a slight spoiler, but it shouldn't come as a shock, Alexia is this killer. What I like though is that we aren't given a motive. She is a sociopath that is crazy and kills people. She enjoys inflicting pain on others. I was pulled in as she feels like Henry or Patrick Bateman. She also doesn't feel bad about the turmoil she puts her family or Vincent through. Alexia is dealing with issues of her own of trying to hide something else and the physical toll it is taking on her.That is about the extent of what I can go into there, but I'm going to do a spoiler section at the end. I'll take this then to the acting for the movie. I thought that Rousselle was great here. She plays this broken character so well. I like that it establishes her as a child and how it has shaped the adult that she is. I also liked Lindon as this broken father. He misses his son and he's getting older so he is losing it at work. His wife left him, I'm assuming over the disappearance of Adrien. He doesn't have much going for him so when he thinks his son is home, he clings to that idea and will do whatever he can to protect it. These two are our leads so I'd also say that Marillier, Las Salameh, Myriem Akheddiou, Bonello, Carrre, Guigue and the rest of the cast also rounded this out for what was needed.Then the last parts to go into here would be the cinematography and soundtrack. I think we get some amazing shots here. The opening credits are done by showing us an engine as it is driving. We get a great establishing sequence to kick off the movie. Alexia goes through some traumatic moments with her condition and how the attacks are filmed. I was impressed. The soundtrack also fits for what was needed and help to set the atmosphere.So then in conclusion here, I'm glad that I saw this movie. It has an interesting enough premise and story that is equal parts grounded with fantasy. The performances from Lindon and Rousselle drive this movie with the rest of the cast there in support. This movie can be brutal with some of the body horror, so if you're squeamish, I'd avoid this. The effects, soundtrack and cinematography all help to build the atmosphere needed here. I'll also warn you, this is an arthouse type film, but if you can get past that style, I think we have a solid film here.My Rating: 8 out of 10SPOILERSWhat I was dancing around here is that somehow, Alexia becomes pregnant. I'm wondering if we are getting a commentary on pro-choice vs. Pro-life. The only time something sexual is done to her is when she masturbates in the car, but it also seems like it is having sex with her. I do wonder if there is commentary here with the fan chasing her, that possible she was raped, but we do not see it. This could explain why she doesn't seem to like men as well. Alexia realizes she is pregnant when she is with Justine. We get a horrific scene where she tries to perform an abortion on herself with a hairpin. It fails though. This seems like the movie is stating that abortions should be done by an expert, not in the 'back alley'.Alexia does carry this baby to full term. She has these recurring problems where she thinks she is leaking motor oil and that her baby is part machine. This goes back to the car, but also because she has a plate in her head. I took this as really meaning that she was raped, carrying a child she doesn't want to. It is a monster growing within her that she eventually gives birth to. It is causing her physical pain and taking its toll on her as well."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10944760/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," A Tectonic & Abstract Vehicle... ","Moving, shifting and writhing through multiple manoeuvres and a myriad of machinations, this head and chin scratcher will confuse and confound but Agathe Rousselle stokes a flame that burns throughout."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10944760/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt"," Doucurnau's auto erotic head turner ","Not since David Cronenberg's CRASH has Cannes seen as 'auto'-erotic a film as Julie Doucurnau's TITANE. And, despite some controversy with each, both movies got Jury Awards (TITANE the Palme D'or).After a childhood flashback leaves Alexia (played as an adult by Agathe Rousselle) with a metal plate in her head. The 30ish woman is now a dancer at a strip club where the ladies gyrate with automobiles (and, if there's something that eclipses a man's fancy more than girls and cars - it's girls AND cars). A bizarre late night S&M encounter leaves Alexia pregnant -- and with an increasing penchant for violence and aggression. Doucurnau (RAW) doesn't flinch from showing the sex and brutality in all it's grindhouse glory. The movie provocatively begs the question of whether it's any less exploitative if it's directed by a woman.After this savage (overly so) opening*, Doucurnau's script (with "consultants") abruptly changes gear when Alexia comes into contact with Vincent (Vincent Lindon), a fire chief of a special fire fighting unit. He takes Alexia under his protection and becomes a father figure to her. Vincent has severe issues of his own, and their relationship becomes a symbiotic one, however peculiar it may be. Rousselle and Lindon play off each other well here and their bond becomes as believable as this strange tale can become. More to the point, it becomes quite moving in its own perverse manner.Doucurnau's movie isn't just interested in the standard horror tropes, as it confronts head on gender identity, sadomasochistic relationships and the fetishizing of women's bodies. Genre fans will see parallels to such earlier films such as Cronenberg's THE BROOD, DEAD RINGERS and RABID (along with the aforementioned CRASH). BLADE RUNNER 2049, UNDER THE SKIN, THE DEMON SEED and last year's PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN are also evoked (the latter, of course, a coincidence of timing). The story-telling isn't always cleanly nor coherently told, but, it accumulates a certain power.TITANE is certainly not your typical Cannes Awards winner, nor your standard horror film, but Doucurnau has created her own disturbing vision of the intersection of sexual politics and what it means to be human in this age of rapidly accelerting advances in bio-medical technology.*there were walkouts in the theater."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10944760/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Raw has a script and this has shock value ","If you expect to watch a horror film, it'll definitely disappoint you. I like the actor who plays Alexia but overall I didn't like it as much as I do Raw which is another French body horror film by the same director but I appreciate this one equally since it is different and disturbing. But here comes the ultimate question: what's horror? I'd say horror-adjacent drama and it's definitely more drama than horror.The first half is really mysterious and gory. Alexia had an accident when she was a child and she had a platinum plate in her skull. She killed the guy who hit on her in the parking lot and the woman to whom she made love and she also had to kill everybody else in the house (this was dark and funny). Then she set fire to her parents' house (and locked their bedroom door, too) and walked away. She cut her hair and broke her nose so that the police wouldn't identify her (I couldn't look at the nose scene even though I'm very tolerant with gory scenes). Then she became an impostor. The man in denial of his son having gone missing and a mother who can't grieve her missing son because of this and their impostor son Alexia. At this point the film didn't make any progress. They had firemen dance parties, they worked and the father tried to kill himself several times. Then she gave birth to a child with a titanium spine in the man's bed and died and the man hugged the baby as if he finally found his missing son."

Maybe Titane will be appreciate better by female audience as the director/writer also is.Like a revewer said, the ridiculous dancing scene without the belly prostetic is done without care.I have see many movies in horror genre, some done much better story and execution wise.

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10944760/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," Some things might be difficult to understand but it will be in your mind for a long time ","Define this movie as Art Cinema is not correct; making a movie is art; good or bad, commercial or not but still art.Titane could be better define as experimental but still commercial and still very good.Instead of going for the standard dysfunctional family drama, Julia Ducournau (the director) uses music, colors, lights and extreme (sometimes shocking situations) as a metaphor for common and ordinary situations. Going for the melodrama could be easier; but the messages will be quickly forgotten; with this way of storytelling it will be in your memory for a long long time.Explaining too much could simplify its greatness. Let's just said that important subjects of parenting failure, communication, chauvinism and loneliness are the main core.The story is intriguing; Alexia as a kid had an accident in her father's car; so a Titanium plaque was fixed in her head.Some years later she is a dancer on a particular type of club. Attempts of human intimacy makes her becomes a sadistic, cold killer. However she has sex with cars (not in but WITH the vehicle itself) and becomes pregnant.After a few deaths and shocking situations; she usurps the identity of a missing (for 17 years) kid and is accepted by the kids father a bomber captain (outstanding Vincent Lindon) as his own; but living with the man is not that easy; particularly as a pregnant woman passing as a male young adult.The second act is a little less shocking than the first; however is still strong and very realistic in some scenes.Just to clarify; there is almost not gore in the movie but the violence (suggested) is clearly present.Agathe Rousselle (is her first movie) put everything and succeeds in creating a character pure madness but ultimately empathetic.The far more experienced Vincent Lindon is even better; transmitting his many pains almost without words. His scenes fighting his age are difficult to forget.In brief; really worth your time and if something is not understood just ask."

This gotta be the most messed up movie that I have ever seen this year. The French really knows how to mess with you eyes. This is the type of movie that you go "I had no idea what was going on, but I kinda liked it." An extremely experimental film, this is not going to be for everyone.There were stomach-churning self-harm scenes that made me look away, and that's rare. Very gory, it made itself clear as a body horror that does not care too much about the plot. I questioned myself constantly what I was sitting through, sometimes laughed at silly lines. I don't know why but it was such a unique experience.Not gonna lie, I had to read an interview from the director to understand the message from her experimental film. It eventually made sense, but in such an extreme way. I felt a bit creeped out at how the director was inspired to make this movie. Some people really do have interesting imaginations.The only problem I had was that I would like to have a more coherent plot. But I guess this worked in making the movie incredibly unpredictable. The ending scene was just as crazy as the movie as a whole.Overall, do not underestimate the minds of the French. They really do create some crazy stuff. 8.5/10."

Whether you are a freak, lone wolf, devil-child, parental failure, mass-murderer, or all the above, someone understands you.Titane suffers no fools, is prone to violence, extremely intense, and feels no pain. She has a titanium plate in her skull from causing a catastrophic accident as a child. She only grows worse with age. Titane's impulsive rage soon puts her on the wrong side of the law. She runs into many freaks such as herself including a macho, steroid abusing firefighter with a vulnerability that she exploits to the hilt.Nothing can prepare you for the level of violence, abuse, and shocking behavior encountered in Titane. The extreme sexuality, hopelessly confused gender identities, and radically dark humor will cause even the most hardened midnight madness and horror show addict to avert their eyes. Yet it cannot be unseen. Watch at your own risk.Titane is the Palme d'Or winner at Cannes. North American premiere seen at midnight madness at the Toronto international film festival.

They are fearless. 'Titane' would never be greenlit by any Big studio. That's why I am so thankful to the french culture and its movies. 'Titane' starts as a surrealist erotic and dark crime thriller that becomes an engaging drama wrapped in a love story that owns multiple meanings.

The film Braveheart was brilliant and deserving of all its rewards, but its narrative arc and focus are much more wide in scope than this film. In contrast Blood on the Crown, is a beautifully nuanced look at the age-old empire vs rebellion story, completely dedicated to the characters' journey, and to my delight, both sides are equally represented in this regard.The angry: hawks, simpletons, and youth of each side is well represented. The compassionate and more reasoned characters of the empire/rebellion, are both finely tuned and developed.It depicts a very 'real' world. Each type of character with their flaws, and we see their struggles, and we understand their motives through many character development and story techniques.I am in awe.And notice how i haven't said anything about the Directing, Acting, Cinematography, Editing, Production design, Music etc?For me, and for stories in general, character development and journey is primary...crucial to any great storytelling.Having said that...All of the above-mentioned key positions in film-making, are without a trace of doubt...MASTERFUL!I was literally blown away by the subtle and nuanced choices the Director/editor made to tell this story!This story could have been about anywhere, and anytime...it is the classic story of human conflict that spans recorded history, and is still equally present or relevant today. The choice to make a film set in Malta, with its beauty and rich history, and the fact that Malta's example sparked future rebellions in other colonized countries, was the perfect choice.Respect to Malta, respect to all the players who helped to make this masterwork of storytelling. It brought me to tears...not because of the troubling and painful history being depicted, but for the sheer power and illumination that great storytelling can, and in the case of 'Blood on the Crown'...absolutely, does possess.A must see... A must feel... Simply a must.P.s. through the entire film i was wondering how I knew, but couldn't remember, who one of the actors was...until i saw the credits...Mr. Keitel...your back baby!!!"

I believe it is a seriously good production given the resources. It appears to be rather historically accurate too with a relatively balanced view of things. We saw it with our tween daughter who is studying these events as part of Maltese history. What I could not understand is the need to pepper a historical drama.with raw Maltese vulgar language as if it were Beverly Hills Cop. I believe it was possible to use less vulgar language and still express the strong emotions in the movie. If you are watching this with your Maltese tween (the English subtitles tend to limit the translation of the colourful Maltese vulgar vernacular to the F word most of the time), be prepared for it."

They often feel stuck by their own inaction. The only one truly figuring out stuff seems to be Jarin. What got me is when Kara tries to climb out. Instead of helping, almost everyone is trying to stop her and stop Trent from joining her. First of all, one of the adults should have tried climbing before then. I also wonder why they don't try to tie together a rope or MacGyver something. The pool noodles are meant to be funny but I just wondered why that's the first time we're shown them. Then there is the passing out bit. The story yadayada a lot of that away. Nevertheless, I still like the idea. It's a fun Twilight Zone episode. M. Night continues to do the twist at the end and this one is fine. This is interesting."

","A bunch of tourists go to a luxury resort, and then head out to a very private beach. When they reach there, they find strange things: a couple of corpses, some wreckage, and then they begin to age physically themselves, at a rate that will have the children in the group dead of old age in 36 hours.I'm not giving any spoiler alert on this, because if you've seen the trailers, you know this already. This being an M. Night Shyamalan movie, we expect twists and turns, and mysteries within mysteries. A very good cast, including Gael Garcia Bernal, and what looked to be some very interesting prosthetic and CGI special effect offered the prospect of a movie layered like an onion.The technical side was well handled, but as to the layers of mystery, they weren't there. The script might have meditated on the seven ages of man. Instead it was more intent on cataloguing the minutiae of the situation, and asserting that being physically old increases your vocabulary and gives you a fine, philosophic attitude, even though you've only got six years of experience. This may be as you like it, but I am not interested in winning flame wars with people who insist things should be absolutely consistent in a fantasy. It's a fantasy. If your goal in life is to demonstrate that you're a better film maker than Shyamalan, then get out of your parents' basement and wangle a job in the industry. For me, the point of fantasy and science fiction are are to offer us a chance to look at a philosophic problem without considering all the messy, real-life details that clutter up a discussion, the unhappy childhood of Sauron, the whataboutism of the Elves cheating the dwarves out of their fees, so they're no better..... real life is messy, real life is complicated, real life requires constant, wary compromise, but fantasy allows us to consider matters and say "What if" without distraction.Except if you don't really care about the question, you're just more interested in working out how people age at a rate of 20,000:1 in detail, and winning the argument in that Reddit chat room. I sympathize. I've been there, I've done that, and I've grown up. Not just physically, but also emotionally and philosophically. Some, anyway."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10954652/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Help me, help ... others ","It's funny that I read so much about a "return" of M. Night .. I thought his last movie had that covered. But then again, that was a few years ago, so maybe some already forgotten about that or he vanished again for them.Having said that, you have to suspend your disbelief in many regards and there still may be things that you have to swallow and not liking them. One of the biggest things I had issues with is the wife of "Guy". It's not so much her accent (others have one too), it is that she does not convey most of the feelings her character is going through. I understand those things, but not because of her performance, rather despite it. You may see it differently and just because I didn't like her performance here, I am not alleging that she can't act. Maybe it is a fish out of water situation - no pun intended.And then there are small things, like when the rapper uncovers ... I think it is in the trailer, but let's just say somethng truly horrific. M. Night should have taken a look at the behind the scenes material of Jaws. Spielberg had a similar scene where the boyfriend of the girl that goes skinny dipping, finds her the next morning with the Sheriff. His reaction to the finding was never satisfactory ... and the same can be said about the scene on hand here. So I am not blaming the actor - it is just a rather "impossible" thing to achieve. I almost started laughing at the scene - very inappropriate I know.And yet still you will say, why a 7? Because through all those things that I might find disturbing and did not like, I was able to suspend my disbelief and was able to enjoy the idea this movie is based on. I personally am surprised there are so many Youtube videos "explaining" the "twist" ending ... I do think it could not be clearer ... and I dig it overall.Of course there are themes of aging, about what our journey is, about family and other things. It's philosophical at its core - what you make of it, is totally up to you of course. But because it is Shyamalan you also will get scenes, that some may have problems with visually (shock effect wise). Think top model (I like her craziness, in the context of the movie, same is true about her husband and doctor) and you'll know what I mean by the end of ... it! Pun maybe intended.Is this predictable? Yes. Dialog and performances sometimes cringe-worthy? Also yes ... fight through it and just enjoy this for what it is. A thriller with a "message" (or two)"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10954652/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," An enjoyable movie. ","I have read several really bad reviews about this film, and the last film or two I watched from Shyamalan were average at best, but there was something about this film that I did enjoy.It flew by, it wasn't slow or dull, nor was it particularly scary, instead it relies on the primal fears many have (self included) about the ageing process, and the passing of time, if you are someone who has the slightest worry of time passing, this will resonate.The location work is awesome, and the production values are superb. Great acting throughout, it's always great to see Rufus Sewell's cheekbones.Not sure if it was my ears, but I found some of the dialogue a little muffled at times.All in all, this was good, 7/10."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10954652/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","3"," M. Night Shyamalan strikes out again... ","Wow. Just wow.This movie was laughably bad. There were so insanely many plot holes and things that made absolutely no sense in this movie, that it got more and more progressively difficult to take the movie seriously, much less enjoy the narrative, as the movie trotted on. I just ended up shaking my head in disbelieve throughout the course of this atrocity of a movie, and you can't help but roll your eyes at this attempt of making a mystery thriller.The storyline told in "Old", while it certainly had an interesting concept, just fell short of being entertaining, and it was increasingly becoming more and more of a struggle to sit through the ordeal that is "Old". And believe you me, this is definitely not a movie that I would recommend you rush out to spend your time, money or effort on.Sure, the acting performances in the movie were adequate, and there were some talented performers on the cast list. But they had precious little to work with in terms of a proper script, and it was restricting their performances.The character gallery in "Old" was interesting enough, but again, too many things just made no sense, which ended up reflecting poorly on the characters, due to some seriously inferior writing.I was lured in to watch "Old", given the movie's poster and its interesting enough synopsis. But with it being an M. Night Shyamalan movie, I can't really claim that I was thrilled or having much of any expectations, as I haven't exactly been a fan of his movies."Old" was a dud, another swing and a miss in the track record of Mr. M. Night Shyamalan.I am rating this heap of a laughable attempt at writing a mystery thriller a generous three out of ten stars. Sure, the movie was nicely produced and edited, but in terms of script, story and entertainment, this was just not cutting it."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10954652/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","2"," As in, "I'm getting too old for this..." ","There was a time that people wanted to give M. Night Shyamalan the title of our generation's Rod Serling, but as time goes on, his films have gone from Twilight Zone to Outer Limits to Tales from the Darkside in quality and now, they hover somewhere around stories that even shows like Monsters would say, "Well, that seems pretty bad." Actually, I really like Monsters and feel bad associating that show with Shyamalan's output. Maybe a better example would be to imagine if Night Gallery was only the Jack Laird comedy bits and The Sixth Sense with none of Serling's contributions.To be even more honest, I feel bad dunking on Old and the works of Shyamalan, which get worse with each release and his hamfisted attempts at being a modern William Castle, like when he got SyFy to air a documentary that claimed that he died as a child and could therefore speak to the dead, suffer from a lack of aesthetics and none of the wonderful hullaballoo that Castle exhibited.So yeah - Old is not good. What did you expect? Each of his films is the very definition of something I usually love, the hijinks ensue film. Get a great concept: an island makes people prematurely age and then...hijinks ensue. But the hijinks here are pretty predictable. And while the director said that he wanted to explore the way his father saw the world through his dementia - dude, I'm dealing with that in my family right now and I don't really want to wade through it in my entertainment - I think this movie would be best experienced if you had no way of comprehending just as shallow and pointless it all is and just enjoyed the pretty pictures.The most entertaining thing about this movie would be the director's statement, which claims that this was influenced by Australian New Wave films like Walkabout and Picnic at Hanging Rock, along with The Exterminating Angel, which actually made me giggle and then get really mad. Also, throwing out Ran, Rashomon and other Japanese films is a desperate stab at "hey I'm an artist!" while saying you're influenced by Twilight Zone and Jaws is like saying that you enjoy drinking fluids and eating food.This story was based on the graphic novel Sandcastle which gives no answers as to why the island rapidly ages people. Of course, we needed the twist to explain it. You know, the real twist would be the director not having a twist in his next film and trying to push himself beyond the hackneyed. Here's to hoping."

A few holidaymakers are taken to a beach where they discover that not only are they trapped there, but that they begin to age rapidly too... Can they escape? Sadly, I didn't really care - the characters are pretty unremarkable, and although the setting is beautiful the rest of it is slow and dull to watch. Rufus Sewell stands out as probably the worst of the bunch, but only marginally more so than an equally out of place Gael Garca Bernal who really did look like he was just waiting for his cheque to arrive. The last twenty minutes could have retrieved the situation had they be handled better, but what little jeopardy - or plausibility the story had had until then just evaporated. Shyamalan ought to have enough clout nowadays to ensure his quirky and intelligent stories are better presented in terms of talent and, especially given it's his own screenplay - writing too."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10954652/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," M Knight keeps swinging ","Greetings again from the darkness. THE SIXTH SENSE (1999) and UNBREAKABLE (2000) created a movie bond with filmmaker M Night Shyamalan that will always exist. In other words, I continue to go into each of his projects with hopeful expectations of another classic. Of course, some have been pretty good (SPLIT, 2016), while others are barely watchable (THE LAST AIRBENDER, 2010). His latest lands somewhere in the middle, but does feature a stunning beach setting (Dominican Republic) - one whose tropical beauty hides a sinister reality.The film's synopsis is captured in the trailer: tourists experience a mystifying and terrifying phenomenon while on a day trip to a gorgeous secluded beach. The director adapted the film from the 2010 graphic novel "Sandcastle", written by Pierre-Oscar Levy and Frederick Peeters. Shyamalan specializes in one thing: big and creative ideas. He is a risk-taking filmmaker, but one not always focused on execution, coherence, or details. Especially awkward here is the dialogue. None of these characters talk like real people. Lending to the awkwardness is the attention given to each character's name and occupation ... except for the kids, where age is the significant data.Due to the nature of the story (and the effects of the beach), the cast is significantly larger than the number of characters. We ride along with one family as they first approach the luxury resort. Insurance actuary Guy (Gael Garcia Bernal) and his wife, museum curator Prisca (Vicky Krieps) are vacationing with their 11 year old daughter Maddox (Alexa Swinton) and 6 year old son Trent (Nolan River). The couple clearly have a strained relationship and appear headed for a break-up. Encouraged by the resort manager to spend the day at a secret remote beach, they are joined by Charles (Rufus Sewell), a surgeon, his calcium-deficient trophy wife Chrystal (Abbey Lee), their young daughter Kara, and the doctor's elderly mother Agnes (Kathleen Chalfant). Another couple is there as well, nurse Jarin (Ken Leung) and his wife Patricia (Nikki Amuka-Bird), a psychologist. Already at the beach when they arrive is rap star Mid-sized Sedan (Aaron Pierre), replete with bloody nose and the corpse of the woman who accompanied him.It's best not to go into specifics about the progression of things for these folks on the beach, but it can be noted that they frantically try to find a way back to the resort. When all attempts prove unsuccessful, that ridiculous dialogue fills in many of the gaps for us, though you should know the science doesn't hold up ... think of it as fantasy instead. As their day at the beach moves forward, other actors take over: Alex Wolff and Thomasin McKenzie are teenage Trent and Maddox, Eliza Scanlen is Kara, and later, Emun Elliott and Embeth Davidtz become Trent and Maddox. It becomes frustrating for viewers as the professions are emphasized: Guy spouts statistics at every turn, Prisca discloses she's not a pathologist, and Patricia attempts to get everyone to bring their feelings to group. Ugh.Despite the many missteps and the overall mess of characterizations, Shyamalan (who also appears as the driver who drops them at the beach) does serve up a creative idea - one that will likely get viewers questioning their own mortality. Mental illness is addressed in a crude manner with Rufus Sewell (a fine actor) bearing the brunt of a poor script, while physical afflictions and the effects of age come off a bit better. The strange looking woman serving up custom cocktails at the resort is Francesca Eastwood (Clint's daughter), and Shyamalan's patented plot twist ending does make sense and even has a contemporary feel to it."

","Discussing with a friend over the phone about meeting up and catching up,we decided over the weekend to hang out and go to the cinema. Checking the listings,we were surprised to find a new M. Night Shyamalan title had just been released. Only seeing the poster before going in,we got set to experience the good old days.View on the film:Taking place in one location for 90% of the runtime, co-star/writer/directing auteur M. Night Shyamalan reunites with John Dies At The End (2012-also reviewed) cinematographer Mike Gioulakis for their third team-up, which continues to expand on Shyamalan's distinctive stylisation of placing the audience in the middle of an unfolding supernatural event, via superb, long take sweeping panning shots scanning across the beach.Shyamalan uses the sweeping shots to wonderfully draw the impression that when the characters are distracted by something for just a few moments,they turn back to the person they were talking to,and are confronted with the horrific sight of that person having rapidly aged.Whilst some of the practical effects have a rubbery bounce,Shyamalan gazes at the rapid ageing with delightful in-camera tricks, as close-ups on youthful faces transforms in arc shots,as they decades ripple away in the blue sea.Adapting Frederick Peeters's and Pierre-Oscar Levy's graphic novel, (the second time he has done an adaptation) the screenplay by Shyamalan links the group of stranded strangers together with a great expansion of his major recurring themes,from couple Guy and Prisca taking their family on a holiday as their marriage falls apart,whilst inquisitive kids delivery chewy dialogue that opens the mystery of the beach,and the surrounding ocean filled with the souls of past islanders (water as a symbol of death/rebirth being a big recurring motif in Shyamalan's works.)Coming from a family of doctors, Shyamalan gives his personal background a Sci-Fi spin,via the rapid ageing of all those on the island, being revealed to also give people the ability to heal at a fast speed.Opening the final via a paper with odd symbols/ signs on it, (continuing from the weird alien markings of Signs (2002-also reviewed)) Shyamalan unveils a peculiar,over-reaching twist ending (complete with flashbacks) on the power behind the island,which never gets old."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10954652/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt"," A win for Shamalyan and a treat for Twilight Zone fans. ",""There's something wrong with this beach!" Prisca (Vicki Krieps)Although aging is rarely a topic for mainstream films except in sci-fi (think 2001, for instance), M. Night Shyamalan brings it home in Old. While his films since Sixth Sense have been uneven or unimpressive, Old is s homecoming for the master of plot twist. While there is a twist, he uses it to resolve plot questions as much as titillate those who look forward to his inventiveness. Mostly he keeps attention as his tale plays with a Twilight-Zone type of conceit in which a group of tourists ages quickly within hours.Because most of us experience old age unwillingly, Old is of interest if only to toy with the idea that it seems like a day since we were once young. We cannot escape our aging, and like those characters we may hide violent motives, try to hold it off, or punish others for it.These pilgrims face two deaths within a short time arriving on the undeveloped island (filmed in The Dominican Republic), and even with a doctor present, Charles (Rufus Sewell channeling Jaws' Robert Shaw), they are not safe. In fact, both children and adults are in danger and do harm even when they don't mean it.But beyond escaping from this cursed island, several participants face issues of love, some marital discord or lack of it, and some existential questions such as their role in life.

However, when they arrive on the beach, with fellow guests Charles (Rufus Sewell), a doctor, and his younger partner Chrystal (Abbey Lee), Patricia (Nikki Amuka-Bird) and her husband Jarin (Ken Leung) and a few others, they mysteriously start to age.........and had better get to the bottom of it.By now, the name M Night Shyamalan really should have served as a red alert to avoid at all costs. After bursting onto the screen over twenty years ago with the jaw dropping, highly original Sixth Sense, from 2002 onwards his output took a steady decline in standards, to the point where each successive film became gradually more ridiculous and nonsensical, and eventually people just couldn't be bothered any more. But something about Old, his latest offering, showed a spark of promise that had been absent for a while, another high concept production that had a spark of potential. But sadly squandered it.If I was sensing something that wasn't there, it seems the producers weren't, as the absence of any press screenings in itself should have sparked a red flag. But I gave it a go, and built up some high expectations. I really tried to get in to it, but a premise as far fetched as this first needs to establish some connection with its characters, to flesh them out a little and get under their skin. Sadly, none of them come off as anything more than cardboard cut outs, who it's impossible to care anything for, or care what happens to them. And with that massive barrier in place, the ensuing outlandish insanity of the story is further hampered in having any appeal.It would be nice one day for a director like Shyamalan, who is at least known for inspired and original ideas, to one day strike lucky again with another winner, but here's just hoping he manages to put it all together right. **"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10954652/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt"," Interesting Concept, Uninteresting Execution ","The latest madcap offering from the filmmaker who has made a career out of coming up with truly insane & ambitious ideas over the years (whether he is able to make them work or not in execution being a whole another debate), Old finds the (in)famous writer-director once again experimenting with a crazy concept but the end result is a mixed bag as the film fails to make the most of what was up for grabs.Written & directed by M. Night Shyamalan (Signs, The Village & The Visit), the story follows a group of tourists who find themselves ageing rapidly on a mysterious & secluded beach. With a lifetime passing in the matter of a single day for all the involved characters, the possibilities worth exploring are endless. However, Shyamalan's erratic direction & bland characterisation prevent the key events to blossom to their full capacity.There are nonetheless hints of brilliance scattered throughout the picture. It just never unifies into a satisfying whole. The rapid ageing & its debilitating effects is rather unsettling to watch but then the dialogues & performances are so idiotic & over-the-top that we aren't really sure what tone Shyamalan was going for. The film is silly yet serious, fun yet terrifying, thrilling yet amusing, ludicrous yet genius, and is often a cinematic ride of sharp contrasts.Overall, Old features a premise that not only exhibits promise & potential on paper but is also instantly appealing & downright ambitious. Still, Shyamalan is unable to explore his zany idea to its fullest by failing to weave a compelling narrative around it, thus resulting in a frustrating & confusing experience. He tries to do too much yet only ends up doing too little. All in all, Old has its merits & moments but the ride as a whole feels more or less underwhelming in the end."

First like 30 minutes were interesting and involving. And it got one or two pretty good scenes near the end on the beach (no spoilers). Other then that "Old" is nothing but a poorly written, sometimes laughably acted (because of bizarre and poor writing) and sadly not very well directed film. On paper i guess it sounded way better, but its unfortunately M. Night Shyamalan's job as director and writer that failed.Overall, i secretly hoped that this might me a good movie done by this once legendary director. His "Split" was pretty good one, but other then that he did not make a good movie since i guess his "Signs" in 2002 - almost 20 years, its a bit of a miracle this creator still gets to make movies but i guess as long as they are profitable that's all that matters.

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10954652/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Entertaining, but not Outstanding ","Shamaylan seems to be one of those directors whose films make money despite the fact that the critics don't seem to be all that impressed with them. Okay, he has had one massive flop, which happened to be The Last Airbender, but other than that he seems to continue to churn out films, and those films continue to make money. The other thing is that he seems to be one of those directors that has a lot more control over his films, and yeah, there are a few of them that fall into that category.I won't say that this film has a twist though, and when people do use the word twist in the film it is put in quotes. It's sort of more of a reveal, and I have to admit that it is pretty difficult to go one better than the 'Bruce Willis is a ghost' twist that pretty much left everybody gaping in The Sixth Sense. Still, it wasn't too bad, even though I can't say that I am a particularly big fan of his films.So, the story is about a family that goes on a vacation to an island resort, and the owner of the resort suggests that they go on a trip to a secluded beach. However, they aren't the only ones that are going to the beach, and when they get there they discover that things don't seem to be all that great, particularly since they discover a body, and then an elderly lady with them just dies. What becomes apparent though is that people seem to age much faster than normal, and I note that there is a mention that the reason they have a lot of food is because there are children with them.I'm not sure how I would categorise this film, though Shamalyan does like his supernatural thrillers. I don't necessarily want to call them horror though because they don't seem to fall into that category, even though I consider horror films to be much more than your typical hack and slash/blood and gore type films that people seem to equate with horror (which I actually don't consider to be horror films, but that is just me).Anyway, it isn't particularly bad, but I wouldn't be putting it up there amongst some of my favourite films, though I do have to admit that I did like the premise - to an extent. I guess the thing that I did have an issue with was that the children, while physically ageing, also seemed to not only mentally age, but also gain knowledge as well - namely with being able to communicate as an adult as opposed to being an adult, but talking as a child. I guess the reason this irritated me is because language, and communication, happens to be a learned trait, not something that is biological that develops as one physically develops. Still, other than that, it wasn't bad."

"," Who dies, in what order, and who lives ","This clumsy headline of mine can arguably be considered a distinct genre by itself. But then, "Old" is more. You can call it any of these: supernatural mystery, horror thriller, science fiction, question on ethics, marital problems scrutiny...the list can go on.At the first scene, I was on the verge of screaming "not again"! You see, I have either watched or am watching the TV series White Lotus, Fantasy Island and Nine Perfect Strangers, all set at idyllic, escapade resorts, where strange thing happen to an ensemble of vacationer seeking just a break, spiritual renewal, or even persona transformation and cure. "Old" does start with the customary establishing scenes upon arrivals at the resort. But soon, the stage moves to a secluded beach, advertised as a special treat offered by the resort, and stay there for the rest of the movie (until the conclusion).It is almost impossible to write meaningfully about auteur M. Night Shyamalan's movies (or any others' in the same genre, for that matter) without involving some criminal-proportion spoilers. What I'll do here is to just set out the plotline, revealing nothing more than already available in its trailers, and offer a rundown of the players.The plot revolves around what a collection of 11 guests experienced on the said secluded beach, within the duration of one day. The paradise-like beach, sealed off by a natural wall of rock cliffs, is accessible only through a dark, ominous passage through it. There is, unfortunately, only one-way traffic. I will not explain the details but just say that it is impossible to leave the beach in the same way. Two alternatives pose equally lethal risks: scaling the cliff or swimming around roaring currents. To stay on the beach is not an option. For some inexplicable reason, passage of time on this beach is distorted, speeded up, to be exact: a year per half-hour. That's right, one aged by half-a-century staying there for just a day. For an average middle-aged individual, it would most likely mean death.The players in this fateful game (poor souls who only deduce this horrible situation gradually) comprises two families of 4, a couple and a single guy. These 11 people is representative of a wide cross section of age and ethnicity, and comes from all walks of life. A Latino husband and white wife with a daughter (11) and son (6) represents the business sector. The other, a white family, comprises an over the hill top doctor (now having mental problems), his mother, his wife and their daughter (6). The couple represent two capable professional, Asian man, a nurse, and his black wife, a psychiatrist. The single guy is a black rapper.With such an interest stage populated by this ensemble of diverse characters, the audience must be tempted to write their own scripts. Whether they can best the writer/director we never know. But Mr. Shyamalan's toughest competition is himself. His early hit "Sixth sense" has set such a high bar that most critics feel that he still has not reached it again after nearly a dozen subsequent tries, including this one.Visually, this movie is a pleasure. One particular composition is so beautiful that I'll remember it for a long time. It is night time with a bonfire at the beach, lighting up the artistically blend colours of the garments of the family, huddled together, facing the dark beyond of the ocean. Looking at their back, the poignant poetry conveyed by this silent frame will bring tears to your eyes.There are two well recognized names in the cast. From the world cinema "A' list is Gael Garcia Bernal, one time Pedro Almodovar's protge. The other, Rufus Sewell, among his prolific work, is perhaps best known for his character "John Smith" in the TV series "The man in the high castle"."

","Choise what moviemoves to be made, the cast clings to mr S's poppy straw getting high and old in an instant, where the pharmaceutics are scrutinized in a world that feel rather insecure already to the firms making wonderdrugs to survive an ongoing pandemic.Well its a coming to age movie, all the stages of deterioration is dealt with, not in the most entertaining, nor frightening way, and the limited location becomes pretty boring after an hour or so.Its very handsomely filmed and crafted, but the actors seems like picked outta a deck of anonymized cards, and the soulmateismic energy is at the lower end of the qualityscale.There are some mishaps on the fact from fiction plotwise and storywiuse, so do your psychedelia before entering this strange epological ephiustel, youll need it for sure thinks the grumpy old man."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10954652/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Unsettling mystery thriller that will leave you guessing. ","4 out of 5 stars.Old is a good thriller film and one of M. Night Shyamalans better films. Which his films are hit and miss with its direction. Old is a hit film. Has a mystery plot. Thrills and themes with a message of time being against us.The plot follows a group of people on a vacation. Going to a resort where they all visit a hidden beach. Which gives them the luxury and beautiful beach. Only until they discover that they are aging at a rapid pace. The kids are growing rapidily. The adults aging. While they have trouble escaping the beach which they black out and end up back at the beach. They cant swim or climb the rocks surrounding the beach without blacking out. The group try to solve the mystery on what the connection is that they have in common. And how are they aging.Good thriller. The cinematography is great. Capturing the beautiful landscape and shocking tone the characters have. The music score is good. The cast ensemble is great. The twist ending is not that bad. Which did not disappoint like M. Nights other films.It does have an interesting concept without going into spoiler territory. And leaving a bit of mystery with the characters connection and the beach. The theme of people not having enough time to spend it with there loved ones was also good.I will say the only negative thing about the movie is it does have a shallow ending that does not feel satisfying.Overall, a good thriller thats worth seeing."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10954652/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," Some Very Interesting Themes Completely Undone By Sometimes Laughably Bad Execution ","M Night Shyamalan is one of the most difficult Hollywood directors to figure out. His resume boasts some all-time classics (The Sixth Sense, Signs, The Village), but is also plagued by some all-time stinkers (After Earth, The Happening, The Last Airbender). It often feels like one never quite knows what they are going to get walking into a Shymalan picture. Unfortunately, "Old" falls much more firmly into the latter category as opposed to the former. While filled with great concepts, this latest M Night joint is almost hilariously bad on the execution front.For a very basic overview, "Old" sees a husband (Gael Garcia Bernal), wife (Vicky Krieps), and two children (Nolan River & Alexa Swinton) stumble upon a strange beach while vacationing. On this beach, the aging process seems to be sped up, rendering an entire life cycle in the span of mere hours. Seemingly unable to escape, the family--along with others--must work to find answers before the clock quite literally runs out on all of them.In terms of the "seed idea" for this film, it is a doozy. Easily the best in a Shyamalan movie since his heyday of the early 2000s. There are interesting themes (aging, parenting, puberty, etc.) at nearly every turn here just waiting to be brought to the surface.Alas, none of that potential is realized. Instead, "Old" plays out like a rather cheap, predictable, & often bland thriller. It technically hits all the beats it should, but with none of the emotion that should be present. Shyamalan is far too focused on the "what is going on?!" of it all when the character journeys should have been first and foremost.Only making matters worse is the fact that none of the auxiliary components are anything to write home about. The soundtrack/score didn't wow me, the acting is just okay, and the visuals are more played for cheap thrills (one scene in particular is utterly laughable) than anything substantive.Of course, one can't critique a Shyamalan flick without mentioning the twist ending. That is certainly present here, and actually not half bad as those things go, but even that is wasted when the film extends 10 minutes beyond it. End right at the twist, and "Old" might jump up a star for me.Overall, though, "Old" is a pretty hollow "thriller" when all is said and done. It ends up being a sort of "worst of both worlds" situation for Shyamalan. It isn't nearly up to the par of his earlier works, while it also lacks the focus of more contemporary efforts like "The Visit" or "Split". Just a generic--bordering on bad--romp."
