But then again, I don't really consider myself to have been the target audience here.Regardless, I stumbled upon the 2021 Netflix movie "To All the Boys: Always and Forever" and opted to watch it, as it was a movie that I hadn't already seen. Nor had I actually heard about it, so I didn't know what I was getting myself into here.I am sure that the movie does have a wide appeal out there, to the right age group and fan base, that I am not a part of. But I have to say that writer Katie Lovejoy didn't really manage to churn out something that even had the slightest of appeal to me.The acting in the movie was adequate, but again, the whole concept of the movie and the target audience thing just sort of made it feel like everything was falling short of finding a home with me.Not having been impressed with director Michael Fimognari's 2021 movie here, then I have to settle for a three out of ten stars rating for "To All the Boys: Always and Forever"."

","The first question I need to personally answer is: Why is a 71 year old man watching and reviewing this Neflix flick? There is a reason -- one of the supporting actors was a student in the middle school where I was (at the time) the vice principal -- and that is Ross Butler. I think he's a talented not-as-young-as-he-looks actor who isn't getting enough good parts, although he did VERY nicely in "Thirteen Reasons Why". I wish him great luck in his career.As to this film...well, it certainly is aimed at the teen crowd. And that's okay. I will tell you this...three "chapters" of this is enough. The plot here is...well, not thin, but one-minded: will the high school lovers have a life together beyond high school. At first it's yes. Then it's no. And finally it's maybe. And I have to admit that the final answer is done nicely, if what you want is a happy ending that's not necessarily very realistic.You're not going to be on the edge of your seat watching this. It's fairly predictable. But I do have to give kudos to Lana Condor, who plays the lead high school character. I think she's a good actress. I'm not as impressed with Noah Centineo, the lead male here. I've seen him in a couple of Netflix movies and...well, I just don't get the attraction. Anna Cathcart, as the younger sister has potential. Everyone else...well they look young and adequate.The first installment of this series of three movies was the best. I really can't recommend this one."

",""To All the Boys: Always and Forever" is a Comedy - Drama movie in which we watch Lara Jean and Peter making plans about their future while they are expecting their results from their college applications. Their future is very fragile and they both have to work very hard to continue together.Since I had already watched the two previous movies I knew what to expect from this one too but I have to admit that it was better than what I was expecting. Despite that for one more time the plot was missing, the movie had some good scenes but it was very predictable. The direction which was made by Michael Fimognari, it was average and since the plot was predictable and we did not watch anything new, made the movie boring.

Peter (Noah Centineo) shows that he is not ready for the commitment of an LDR. Lara Jean (Lana Condor) ends up being a passive character willing to give up everything for him. She basically goes to a school that is not her first choice to save the relationship.And getting back together was a cheesy way to wrap things up.

Even High school musical looks more decent next to this movie. Generic. Forced. Quality. Light performances that go along the same lines, although it tries to present more mature characters, it does not succeed, although they are larger, they are totally wrong. That sets the bad example to the adolescents and pre-adolescents to whom it is directed. Talk about being possessive in relationships, being the toxic people in the relationship.

Two hours of Larajean hopelessly devoted to Peter and having an emotional rollercoaster at her room. And Peter acting all cool and effortlessly popular. It's honestly very have to relate to them and care for the storyline. And as everyone has said, that's no plot. It's just a bunch of montage without real happenings that push the story progression or character growth.And can we talk about how Peter SUDDENLY changed his mind and prepare this surprise and Larajean SUDDENLY felt okay about everything again?

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10687070/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Madela is a Terrific Satirical Entertainner set in Election battlefield and Castism Issues which shows the power of ONE DAMN VOTE! ","Madela (2021) : Movie Review -Tamil Cinemas deserves a big round of applause for taking this subject on. The cinematic aspects can be discussed later but firstly a loud scream only for making this satirical and revolutionary film. Mandela is a political satire set in the election battlefield where nothing matters except for vote but surprisingly it goes beyond that to send a few revolutionary thoughts to all the voters of the country. It is an absolute entertainer with lots of humour but moreover it is must attend thought-provoking seminar for every 18+ person in the society.So, Madela is about a barber from the low caste who is almost like an exiled begger in the village. His fate turns overnight when he becomes the single deciding vote in the village elections. Now, here he decided to live for himself only to cause him dangerous implications and then how he brings a revolutionary change in the village is all you get to see in the film. The writing is top notch considering the value of this subject and how carefully it is handled without breaking any set terms of electoral process. The screenplay adds entertaining elements to keep it engaging and crispy and it also keeps many surprises in store.Madela is a story of a barber hence he's the man who gets all the attraction throughout the film but unexpectedly it has plenty of supporting roles having solid impact and longer screen presence. Yogi Babu as Mandela is hilarious and technically very sounded according to different different situations. Sheela Rajkumar as his female interest is simple but effective. You know, keeping the romance and typical love story aside is one of the finest thing happened to Mandela. The storyline did not required any useless romance just to please the mainstream massy audience and it's a very good thing that this Sheela Rajkumar's character didn't go that way. In supporting roles, GM Sundar and Kanna Ravi share a blasting chemistry of rivals.Talking about the technical aspects, Mandela is by far decent here. It doesn't add up anything from the music and cinematography due the completely repulsive content but using all the stuff as per requirement has helped the film to look more real. Director Madonne Ashwin has written it too, so he knew exactly what to do it and how to present it. Comedy, humour, drama, emotions and social awakening he kept all the ingredients in correct sizes, none of them overtakes any. Ashwin also puts enough heart touching moments like the climax scene and disturbing ones like the casteism and inequality. A special mention to the dialogue writer for some clapworthy one liners. One the best one goes like this, "You don't know how to vote but you know to make money from that vote." Claps! Overall, Madela is one of the most socially important films coming from south cinema and deserves your attention for so many reasons. Watch it.RATING - 7/10*"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10687070/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Mandela ","Good Movie. Everybody acted well in the movie. Songs were not needed in the movie. BGM was good in the movie.

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10687070/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," A political satire that's well worth your time! [+77%] ","The one-vote-makes-a-difference story was tackled in a tepid, commercial manner in A R Murugadoss' Sarkar back in 2018. Mandela, written and directed by Madonne Ashwin, strips itself off usual Tamil cinema tropes, positions itself as a no-holds-barred political satire (without pointing fingers), and most importantly, entertains for nearly 140 minutes. The film is set in a small village, closely following events that lead up to a local body election, where two half-brothers are battling it out. Caste division is rampant in the village, distinguishing people as either Southerners or Northerners. You can picture this story play out not just in rural Tamil Nadu, but in entire rural India.Yogi Babu plays Smile, the local barber, who becomes an overnight sensation as his vote is deemed the deciding factor in the election. The simple, straightforward story is given the comical treatment with almost all one-liners tickling our funny bone. There is a host of interesting characters too, with great comedic timing. In fact, they can transition from funny to menacing to funny again in a matter of seconds. Leading from the front is a restrained Yogi Babu (who adopts the name Nelson Mandela in the film), who gets to display his acting chops without having to resort to stale, body-shaming humour. His teenaged side-kick (aptly named Sideburn) is also on point here.Ashwin deserves applause for tackling such a publicly-known-yet-rarely-discussed issue of caste politics and corruption with reasonable maturity. The film does feel slightly stretched in the second half, but the final 30 minutes compensates for that with a lot of fun, feel-good moments. Another appreciable aspect is how Thenmozhi, the newly appointed postwoman, is the one that sets the engrossing chain of events in motion. She isn't just an appear-and-disappearing heroine. I liked how she, along with the leader of the village panchayat, both command presence in the film's climax.Mandela is a neat pick by Netflix. It deserves to be seen by a much larger audience, beyond the borders of Tamil Nadu. I had a great time with it!"

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10687070/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," Fictional but powerful!! ","There are some movies that bashes on politics and corruption in the name of political drama. But, this movie is refreshing with multiple new angles - not vilifying the antagonist - they have a proper motive which the hero lacks, corrupt people - in fact everyone has a corrupt side right from the townsmen, the wives and even our hero. The beauty of this movie is the concept of 'one vote'. How the villains and the hero uses it makes it an absolutely engaging watch. Must watch!!"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10687070/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Tales from Tamil Nadu !! ","Quality movies are rare in Tamil cinema, movies that impress both mainstream audiences and film connoisseurs are rarer, full credit to director Madonne Ashwin, Tamil audiences get a chance to experience something that is very well crafted and swashbuckling, at least once in 3 years. It's a big shame that Mandela couldn't garner a much wider theatrical release. Mandela is a comical political satire, that is wonderfully presented to us by its loveable, authentic, rustic, well defined and strong characters led by the inimitable Yogi Babu.Mandela has a strong storyline, that will make the viewers think and inspire in various ways. Cinematography is topnotch, with the DOP's choice of filter aiding the mood of the tale. Screenplay laced with some sprinkling of black humour is near masterpiece levels, it is fresh yet very profound and strong. Production design and makeup are good. Costumes are very good and accurate, a rarity in Tamil movies. Music with its songs are outstanding in some portions.Yogi Babu as a lead actor, delivers wonderfully well, ably supported by by a huge brigade of junior artistes, led by Sheela Rajkumar.Overall, Mandela is an brilliant all round film that answers some questions on socio-political spectrum in a mature way. The movie is designed for the entire family, again which is a rarity these days. The raw film is a thorough voice over of the common man and is brutally open and honest to the point of answering questions that have no answers. There is not a single dull moment in the screenplay, Two Thumbs for story, direction and for the satire. Thank you Madonne Ashwin, 8.2 stars out of 10 for team Mandela for a peek into Soorakudi Village."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10687070/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," The first and the last shot-narrative of the movie ","I'm not going to talk about the subject first, because the emotional accompaniment at the end (which was predictable) stays with me now. Yes, I can feel that emotion when the villagers surround Mandela and protect him. Absolutely it is political satire restricted inside a small village, Sooramkudi, and the upcoming local body election well. The film can be narrated easily by only showing the first and last shots respectively. I like the open-ended conclusion which resounds the audience to think whom Madela has cast his vote. As I early said, Mandela is congested inside Sooramkudi but the opening scene expands its vision to the current Indian scenario. It is about the suffering of the people because of the unavailability of the toilet system. It is directly linked to the 'Shauchalay mission' of the Central government in India. I'm not going too political, but as an Indian citizen, I just recall it. The privilege of defecating is another struggle open up there. From the initial scene, the director delivers his objective and his cue for the upcoming events to come. The illegality lies in the election campaigning process, how people are influenced by the political parties while they offering money to them, how the parties behave when they fail in the election etc. Are the key elements which we can experience through the film. A special congratulation to Madonne Ashwin to portray such kind of relevant issue without any gimmicks and also Yogi babu to deliver something brilliant out of him through the character Smile/Mandela. Wonderful backups by Sheela Rajmukar as Thenmozhi and the unknown boy as Mandela's companion. All other characters were also done their part beautifully and rawly. A nice and must-watch one."

Sure, there's politics in the movie, but there's issues about caste, identity, gender-based discrimination, ignorance, and so on. And it doesn't feel like the movie is trying to do too much at any point.The acting in the movie was amazing by everyone involved. Yogi Baby has come a looong way and props to him! There were so many metaphors, so much symbolism in the movie.This is a funny but deep movie. You'll laugh, be shocked at the same time, and will catch yourself saying "Actually, this is nothing to be shocked about, that's exactly how it would be/is in real life. Nothing is gonna change."But that's the point of the movie, to tell this story of how each vote matters and how things CAN change, or at the very least, lets at least talk about these issues in real life as a Step 1 and be hopeful for change.Would totally recommend. 2 hours only!"

It's a phenomenal entertainer. It lives to make you laugh. A majority of the scenes are designed to make you giggle, guffaw, chuckle or even smirk.The surprise package of the film is Yogi Babu. I expected almost nothing from this film and throughout this almost 135-minute, I was constantly telling myself how good it really is. Mandela is political satire at its sharpest.

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10687070/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," Mandela is a must-watch comedy-drama that would make you realize the social issues revolving around the society that we are all living in today ","Tamil films have been enlightening issues that have been widely affecting the Tamil people. Starting from the typical political corruption to the importance of a vote, many films have spoken about the politics that surround a common man's life. Madonne Ashwin's Mandela can be termed as one of its kind and a film that has everything to grab your attention. Mandela speaks loudly about politics, caste issues, and the importance of a vote. The way that Madonne used to tell his story must be appreciated for its uniqueness and its strong vision on politics. This is definitely not a political film but instead, a strong comedy-drama. Madonne Ashwin blended the right ingredients to create a sort of perfect meal for the day. The comedies are really natural and super hilarious. Especially with Yogi Babu on board, there are no limitations for comedies. Mandela is undoubtedly the best film of Yogi Babu to date. He is the heart and soul of this film. Right from the beginning till the climax, his portrayal as the common man who struggles to find a place for himself in a society that rejects him for his identity and his caste reveals to us his true essence as an actor. Yogi Babu as Mandela is naive and innocent with the hope of achieving the dream of his father which is to build a big saloon in his village. The hurdles and the pains that he went throughout the film would be hard-hitting and enlights the typical issues that are in real society. Madonne Ashwin brought us the best performance of Yogi Babu. The way that he has crafted his role would be an eye-opener for many filmmakers on how to bring out a true performance from a widely known comedian aka an underrated actor. Mandela is the definition of how a film can be hilarious as well as remarkable for its social issues. This is not the typical Shankar film or A. R. Murugadoss film to keep you awake about the serious issues through countless strong dialogues and a portrayal of people suffering from corruption. Mandela is a film that doesn't need any of the above mentions. It's a film that realistically portrays the issues faced by a common man within the comedy genre. Madonne Ashwin creates some kind of relatability with the emotional and quite realistic narration. The film is real and pure. There are no special effects or unnecessary subplots. Mandela dives into its initial plot right from the word go. Madonne has made sure that the film's main strength lies in its writing. He has written memorable scenes with the environment itself being a character in the film. There are many valuable scenes that not only bring out the laughter needed but also make us think about it even after the end. Many scenes are well executed and their true value can be seen by the visually pleasing cinematography. Every character in the film has a scope and a unique identity which is probably why people can relate to it easily. It's worth saying that Mandela is definitely a memorable film in Tamil cinema. It's one of the few films that I had no issues with it. Overall, Mandela is a must-watch comedy-drama that would make you realize the social issues revolving around the society that we are all living in today."

( Not a spoiler but a scene discussion ) in the movie there is a scene where yogi babu's brother(kind off) gets hurt and is about to die.

","Louis (loo-eee) Wain was a British artist who lived 1860 to 1939, dying a month before he would have turned 79. He also fashioned himself as a composer and an inventor although those never came to fruition. He had theories about electricity but nothing practical like Tesla.However he made his reputation with cats, especially drawing cats in all kinds of real and fantasy situations. That is his lasting legacy. Within his family, himself and his five female siblings, were some types of mental illness. All this is prominent in this movie.Before watching it I knew nothing of Louis Wain and now find him to be a fascinating person. I already knew Benedict Cumberbatch to be one of the better working actors currently and he certainly hits a home run as the colorful and eccentric Wain.My wife and I watched it at home on Amazon streaming."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10687506/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," tragedy or triumph? ","Greetings again from the darkness. If you fancy yourself a cat lover, you've likely seen his drawings, or at least some of the many 'copies' that other artists have produced over the years. Louis Wain was a prolific British illustrator, best known for his anthropomorphic paintings and drawing of cats (think of the kitschy paintings of dogs playing poker). Writer-director Will Sharpe and co-writer Simon Stephenson have delivered a biopic of Wain that focuses less on his art, and more on his gradual mental breakdown.The film opens in 1881, and Louis Wain (played by Benedict Cumberbatch) is a young man, whose life has just drastically changed. The death of his father has forced Wain into the role of breadwinner for his five younger sisters and their aging mother. Initially, we aren't sure what to make of Wain. His stern and demanding sister Caroline (Andrea Riseborough) is unforgiving of his whims and demands that he find steady work to support the family. An interview with an editor/publisher played by Toby Jones allows us to see what a gifted illustrator Wain is ... and his speed is substantially due to an incredible ability to draw with both hands simultaneously.Wain's eccentricities include a belief in the electrical currents that drive all life forms. The film doesn't spend much time on this, but it seems to be a cog in his mental illness - deemed schizophrenia (though that's been debated). Wain overcomes his insecurity around his cleft lip and marries Emily Richardson (Claire Foy), the governess to his sisters. For the times, this was quite a scandal, given the differences in age and social standing of Louis and Emily. However, it seems as though she was the only one who understood and encouraged him as an artist.When tragedy strikes, Wain becomes inspired by their pet cat, Peter. In fact, Peter becomes Wain's muse, and leads to thousands of drawings for publication in newspapers, magazines, greeting cards, and just about every other platform. Olivia Colman provides some lively narration, and Taika Waititi and Nick Cave both have brief cameos. Cumberbatch is a bit over-the-top with his tics in the first half of the film, but his talent is clear as he portrays a man whose mental health deteriorating, and one who must rely on his special skill to find purpose. Wain spent the last 15 years of his life in a hospital, illustrating right up until the end. While Wain's legacy lives on in his work, there is also a message here - embrace your weirdness!Amazon Studios will release THE ELECTRICAL LIFE OF LOUIS WAIN in theaters on October 22nd, 2021 and on Prime Video on November 5th, 2021."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10687506/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Pleasant bio-pic, "making our lives happier and cattier" ",""The Electrical Life of Louis Wain" (2021 release from the UK; 111 min.) is a biopic about British jack-of-all-trades Louis Wain. As the movie opens, the voice-over reminds us that "Victorian England was full of innovation". It is "1881" and we are introduced to Louis Wain as he is on a train on his way back from a country show. Among the many things he does, his illustrations are quite remarkable, and it's not long that he is offered a full-time position at the Illustrated London News, which offer he promptly rejects, much to the dismay of his brothers and sisters and mum, all living together under the same roof. Louis then catches the eye of the new governess who also has moved in... At this point we are 10 min into the film, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest film from British director Will Sharpe. Here he brings us a biopic about a man whom I had never heard of before, the multi-talented multi-tasking Louis Wain. The movie comes with an overall sense of whimsical irreverence, or even zaniness, like a screwball comedy. The film is uber-British and uber-Victorian. Some of the lines (brought in heavy British accents) frankly went straight over my head. Benedict Cumberbatch plays the title role with a similar vibe, to the extent that you really can't take too much of this all that seriously. While this makes for OK viewing as the movie unfolds, it left me wondering at the end "what exactly was the point of this?". There is of course nothing wrong as such with having a lighthearted movie. Other than Cumberbatch, the cast was pretty much unknown to me. Heads up: veteran British rock musician Nike Cave has a small role (as H. G. Wells). Blink and you might miss it."The Electrical Life of Louis Wain" opened in select US theaters 2 weeks ago, and this weekend it started streaming on Amazon Prime, where I caught it. If you were one of the few who knew of Louis Wain beforehand, or if you are simply a fan of Benedict Cumberbatch, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it on Amazon Prime or Amazon Instant Video, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion."

I never was aware of the electrical life outside of him speaking the word elecricity.I became bored with his recurring 'mental water hallucinations' and Mr. Wain is just annoying. Good luck enjoying this one."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10687506/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," Beautiful film - Filled With Drama, Comedy, Romance And Tragic Events ","I like The Electrical Life of Louis Wain because I learned facts about electricity that I didn't know before. I learned to see electricity in a different way. What I like about this movie is that it is based on the life of the painter Louis Wain and it is filled with drama, comedy, romance and tragic events.This extraordinary film is about the eccentric, British painter named Louis Wain portrayed by Benedict Cumberbatch. The film beings in 1880s London when Mr. Wain is a young boy, and his family depends on him economically. He loves painting animal portraits, rather than people and when his younger sisters need a teacher (Claire Foy) he accepts a better job in order to pay for the governess who he falls in love with and marries. Wain has a peculiar way of feeling and seeing electricity; seeing it as a feeling between people and animals, especially cats, which takes him to painting cats and making a huge profit from those paintings.The scenes in this film are exquisite, showing Victorian style furniture, houses and beautiful landscapes of 1880s London. The costumes are also from the Victorian era. We see British traditions like drinking tea at midday, visiting the opera house to watch a film and gossiping between nosey neighbors. The instrumental music is very appealing as well. The movie is narrated by Olivia Coleman. I believe this film will be nominated for Best Picture of 2021 and I predict Benedict Cumberbatch will be nominated for Best Actor, because his performance as Louis Wain from each stage of his life is magnificent. Mr. Wain's world was full of eccentric and colorful imagination. His infatuation with cats made him one of the most acclaimed painters of his era. His last work was about cats wearing Victorian outfits and acting as humans. What if Mr. Wain was smart enough to see beyond what normal people can see?The moral of this film is to understand that mental health, besides being an illness, can also be a gift, if treated. This film does contain some mature content and strong language.I give The Electrical Life of Louis Wain 5 out of 5 stars and recommended to ages 12 to 18. Plus adults. The movie will be released in theaters and on Amazon Prime November 5, 2021. And remember, if you or your loved ones suffer from mental health, don't hesitate to look for help. Mental health requires a great deal of attention and it needs to be faced and dealt with. By Ethan P., KIDS FIRST!"

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10687506/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," More moving and more entertaining than I expected, Cumberbatch is impressive and Foy is wonderful ","This is not going to be an objective review by any means: I am a cat lover (my female cat Lisbeth is like my daughter to me), a Claire Foy lover and a Benedict Cumberbatch fan. And this movie has this three elements firing on all cylinders all the time. I was expecting this movie to be good, but not to be so much more moving and invigorating.Truth be told: the first half with Foy and Cumberbatch (with a special entrance by Peter) is the best part. It is funny, poignant, romantic, human and beautiful. The second half may not resist the runtime that good: when Cumberbatch is with Foy the screen and their chemistry fully ignites, and that intimacy is sorely missed in the later half. But Wains illness and how Cumberbatch plays his final days make up for a heartfullly teary, satisfying ending.Do not miss the first part of the credits and pay respect and admiration to the real paintings of this legendary artist. Life is hard and incredibly unfair, but also good, funny and surprising; it takes to reach out to that great moments even when the crisis, the olding and the illness come all together -just like Emily tells Louis-. And this movie shows it wonderfully. Probably it is a bit flawed (like life itself), but beautiful performances by Cumberbatch and Foy, a stunning directorial style and the right amount of heart makes this biopic one that has to be seen, so one that makes justice to its characters. Prepare to be surprised."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10687506/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","3"," What is it meant to be? Comedy, drama, serious biography? ","I wanted to like this as I like Cumberbatch and wanted to see if he could do comedy and indeed he can. However remove his character and this becomes a maudlin tale of nothing, it basically cannot decide what it is. Wain's life and pretty much all the family lived a pitiful existence but the director deems to give the film the Beatrix Potter children's treatment. Subsequently it just doesn't work."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10687506/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," Wain's world ","It was nice to finally see Benedict Cumberbatch flex his acting muscles I believed he lost after all those countless Marvel endeavors he had. Here he totally transformes into Louis Wain and delves headfirst in his electrical life and catful adventures in this outstanding motion picture.Before buying the ticket to the movie theater I had absolutely no idea who Louis Wain was and this was probably the main reason why I loved the movie so much - not research the movie before seeing it should be necessary, I think. Otherwise the whole movie experience can be cut down to just an average lesson with tons of homework, like I had with aforementioned Marvel movies whereas a film should be a piece of art on its own and must be experienced the way it is presented, from start to finish. And The electrical life of Louis Wain does that one hundred percent.The personality of Louis Wain was extraordinary and Benedict succeeded in bringing his version of the artist to life on the screen. With the great deal of help from the makeup artists, prosthetics, beautiful music score, visual effects and colorful representation of Wain's world I was able to feel his pain and struggles, and see the world through the prism of his vision. Claire Foy was another reason the movie turned out to be so whole and complete and the way her character shaped the one of Benedict's made me feel this "electricity" only a person who has loved and lost could feel.There are only a few people who can make us realize what a world we live in really is, if it's worth living for even after they're gone. And once we found them we could easily be considered the happiest people alive; Louis Wain was among them as well and he helped deliver this happiness to many more, even after he was gone."

He's so raw, sweet and vulnerable. I just wanted to hug him the whole time.He and Claire Foy are so, so cute together. Out of all the leading ladies he's shared the screen with, Claire is the one he has the most brilliant chemistry with.And cats. So. Many. Gorgeous, cute cats and kittens.It isn't easy to pick and chose moments of an entire person's life in a biopic - but Will Sharpe managed to do it perfectly.10 out of 10."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10687506/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," A captivating film. Benedict Cumberbatch and Claire Foy are great! ","Saying that Benedict Cumberbatch is a versatile actor is putting it mildly. Having done star turns as Hamlet, Sherlock Holmes, Doctor Strange, and Alan Turing among others, here he is the far less well known but fascinating Victorian artist Louis Wain. One thing that most of BC's roles have in common though is that they are fairly cerebral figures: they live in their minds. I don't know of any other actor who can do this kind of persona on screen more convincingly. Wain himself was a truly peculiar figure: he specialized in drawing and painting cats, and as time went on the late-Victorian-era public eventually ate up the odd charm of his work. He would have been far more successful if he'd had an ounce of business sense, but as it was he always lived on the edge of poverty.It didn't help that insanity ran in Wain's family too, and he himself teetered on the edge of mental illness as well. As far as I've been able to check, the events of the movie follow his life pretty accurately. He was by turns eccentric, focussed, happy, depressive, lucky, shy, manic, unlucky, tormented, delightful -- every contrast and internal contradiction you can imagine. He was the kind of off-kilter figure that somehow Victorian England seemed to foster.I've always liked Cumberbatch but until seeing this film I didn't fully realize how *physical* an actor he can be. He invests his whole body in the role and not just his dialog. Look at the way his Wain simply walks down the street here -- short rapid strides, uncertain, shy, nervous. Compare that with his Sherlock Holmes, with his confident, almost arrogant stride. Things like that make up real mastery.Claire Foy isn't on screen quite as much but she's excellent as the love of Louis' life Emily Richardson. Emily shows up as the appealing governess to his youngest sisters, and the central tragedy of both their lives is that they have so little time together. Emily's single line "just when I was starting to enjoy it", spoken with her signature positive stiff-upper-lip nature, is heartbreaking. And if it weren't for the over-the-top peculiarity of Louis, she too would be seen as eccentric in her own way.It's a beautiful film to look at. The outdoor scenes are intensely colorful, the late Victorian ambience is meticulously rendered as only the English can do, and Arthur Sharpe's score is lovely. One very odd thing about the production, though, is the screen aspect ratio of all things. It's almost square, like early movies decades ago. It's obviously intentional but it's just not clear what the point is. Is it supposed to make things feel more like an old movie? More claustrophobic perhaps?Very much worth seeing. Louis Wain is a forgotten figure whose story needed to be told."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10687506/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Forgotten Visionary ","Based on a true story, this remarkable movie was a fun, memorable, and entertaining watch, and not just because it starred Benedict Cumberbatch as Louis Wain and Claire Foy as his wife Emily Richardson-Wain.Directed by Will Sharpe, and written by the man himself with Simon Stephenson, "The Electrical Life Of Louis Wain" gave me a peek into a slice of Victorian England featuring the life and times of the titular character, and his peculiar choice of illustrative work that led to grand success.Arthur Sharpe's musical scoring was quaint and uplifting. Erik Wilson's 'vintage' cinematography was vibrant and refreshing. It was wonderful to have seen a great team make a 'period piece' that both captivated and educated.Suzie Davies's production design deserves special mention - it made the film that much more convincing. Art direction and set direction too did good work on this project. Michael O'Connor's costume design further made a good impression. The hair and makeup department infused the characters with detailed excellence - Louis' prosthetic nose was exceptionally realistic. VFX and special effects rounded off the 'compelling factor' prevalent in this script.Performances were all on point and dragged me into the story, keeping me rooted to each character-arc, including and especially the characters of Louis (bohemian, eccentric, ambidextrous, and ingenious artist, visionary, and innovator) and Emily Wain (his wise and supportive wife who originally served the Wains as a governess).Sir William Ingram (played by Toby Jones), Max Kase (played by Taika Waititi), and Caroline Wain (Louis' sister, played by Andrea Riseborough) all gave good performances. The narrator's voice sounded familiar to me, and I was glad to learn it was indeed Olivia Colman who lent her voice to this project.We see 'cat photos' and 'kitten videos' online so frequently that it was stunning to realize that someone like Louis Wain was creating much the same impressions and invoking similar sentiments so many decades before the advent of the Internet. This movie covered a time when cats were not seen as conventional house pets or companions. Louis' artworks in the film changed that perspective, much as they once did in real life.His love of electricity also inspired him to draw connections to the choice of N-S-E-W direction a cat chooses to walk and the manner in which they twitch their whiskers - the cat-show scene covered this quite well, though I am not personally sure if that observation was factual or fictional."The Electrical Life Of Louis Wain" made me feel that history only repeats, and that everything we enjoy or suffer today has its origins somewhere in the past. This movie - literary elements and more - made for memorable viewing. It dramatized not just the happy moments but also plenty of heartbreaking ones in Louis' life."

The film really reminded me of The Imitation Game (2014) and that's perhaps because of Benedict Cumberbatch's performance that really reminded me of his character Alan Turing (from The Imitation Game) and also perhaps because both Alan Turing's life and Louis Wain's life were full of obstacles. But, in my opinion, Benedict Cumberbatch's performance in this film is way better than his performance in The Imitation Game (2014). His acting was so genuine, especially that there are so many scenes in the film (emotional/dramatic scenes) where the camera was mainly focusing on his face. There's a specific scene in the 2nd half of the film where the camera was mainly focused on Benedict's and Claire Foy's faces for maybe 3 whole minutes and the camera didn't cut so it was a long take scene and they both presented the best performance that I have ever seen for both of them.The cinematography was so beautiful and the film is visually stunning especially that the film had so many shots that look like an actual painting. Sometimes I felt like in a few scenes the film had that "Wes Andersen style" with the camera movements, the set design, and the cinematography. I also really really loved that the film was shot in the 4:3 aspect ratio.Loved the editing and the transitions in the film especially in these moments where the Director wanted you to feel how/what Louis Wain is feeling.One little small detail that I enjoyed as well is Olivia Colman narrating the film as if it is a fairy tale. I felt like using this method/way of telling this story made the film less heavy or less boring, especially that Louis' story could seem dull/sad/depressing sometimes.But my only problem with the film is that I felt like the film focused too much on the "romance" especially in the first half. Also, there's a specific event that occurs that changes the direction of the film and shifts it. The movie jumps all of a sudden and immediately after that event to a whole new event which confused me because I wanted to see what happened and how Louis dealt with that. After that event, the film went down a bit and started to be boring and it lost the taste that it had since the beginning.Also, I got to point out that the custom design, set design, and hair & makeup were very well made especially the hair & makeup which really surprised me, especially at the end when all the characters became "old".My rating is 8/10 Watched: at home."

I expected some kind of creepy haunted house movie but instead what I got was a low key stalking thriller going through the motions. It's supposedly based on a true story but is so far from the truth as to be make believe. It's another run of the old 'living in the house' plotline which has been done so many times before; if you want to see a good version try the Spanish movie SLEEP TIGHT.

Well if you think that is funny because it is "true" (we're talking movies and plot and all that), you may have an issue with the movie on hand already.It also seems a bit all over the place when it comes to the couple and their issues (marital and otherwise). But it is suspensful and if you are able to stick with it (suspend your disbelief) ... you have a neat and decent little horror film to watch. The ending reminded me of at least one other movie I watched recently - but can you hold it against this movie?"

Based on a true story, a couple moved into a house with a dark past, and started experiencing creepy occurrences.As a haunted house movie, there were few surprises. Things just progressed in a predictable way. As one of the character experienced more weird occurrences around the house, she got ridiculed by her husband and cop. This was done many times before, but this movie's horrible dialogues and pretty bad acting from the cast didn't ruined the tension and urgency. It was definitely too long and did not hook me into the mystery.Besides the good-looking house, this movie felt cheap, probably because of the sound effects and horror. There were so many predictable jump scares that irritated me. I had to admit tho, that one or two scenes didn't use jump scares and did creep me out a little.And then the revelation, not only was it predictable, but it was also bad. It wasn't scary at all. The design, look, and acting were all amateur.Overall, despite some decent moments, it's just another cheap and cliche horror on Netflix. 4/10."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10691162/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," The very last gesture all the actors do shows you what the directors thought of us ","Ok...this actually wasn't bad...AND that's why I KNEW it was gonna fall apart at the end and turn out to be straight STOOPID! And I was 1000% correct about that!Many reviewers don't get who Otto is...that was explained by the sister of the brother who was murdered at the beginning. The murdered wife had an affair with Otto and designed the house so that he could live in the walls with her WHILE SHE'S STILL MARRIED TO AND LIVING WITH HER HUSBAND!! That's the first red flag...at no point did the husband and wife visit the house while it was being built? Yes they would have...so that secret room would've been known about right from the start. I suppose the wife could've played it off like a place to hide if they needed to in the event of a home invasion or whatever but c'mon!So Otto lost his mind at some point and killed his lover and her husband. And then just hunkered down and stayed in the house. That was dumb.And then at the end they try to throw in a twist by showing the closet door opening but that's dumb because Otto is dead. The only thing I can think of is they are leading us to believe it is the sister of the guy who died at the beginning but that makes zero sense. There was no reason for that. They should've ended it without the "Month later" thing. Then it would've been fine. Why do directors feel like they have to put in some dramatic twist ending all the time?! It just ruins the whole thing!Then finally they all flip the house off at the end. I mean...that was a bit of tongue in cheek like "Eff you audience! You just got played by all of us!"I wish that movies would have good endings. I hate when a film is fairly decent all the way through and then the ending happens and it just leaves a bad taste in your mouth. Why don't directors start with an ending and work back? Who cares if the film is ok all the way through if the director is just gonna give up at the end?Also there is no way Otto wouldn't have shown up on camera. No one would be staying in a house after almost being raped by an intruder but they thought they'd cover that by having the husband say "Where you gonna stay? Our credit cards are maxed out." Ok what about the Mom or the sister? I know she didn't like her Mom but desperate times...also Ashley Graham's character didn't know that her sister wasn't really away but even though she thought that why didn't they show her at least trying to reach out? Also the sister looked like she was in an advanced state of decomposition which means she would've been dead for awhile so there wouldn't have been blood. I thought that it was actually Otto in the bed and that he would turn and inject Shawn Ashmore when he got in bed. I guess that was too logical for the writers. Why didn't Otto attempt to shower, brush his teeth or at least steal some clothes to replace his tattered ones? There's just too many glaring things that are so dumb. It's an insult to the intelligence of the audience.I can't say I'd recommend this."

However, I was watching for the chills and those were good. The scary parts were well done. The wife's ordeal was well executed."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10691162/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Trying too hard ","This movie had some good things going for it. Good cast, beautiful setting, interesting storyline (at least at first), decent pace and a lovely dog (which, btw, in reality would have caught the intruder like a million times).Problem is they were trying too hard to surprise the viewers that they ended up complicating the story too much to the point it became dumb. Too many unexplained things going on and worst of all was the interaction between the two main characters. I get you have difficulties but who acts like that? The only horror here was this marriage. Sorry to say this but if your marriage is that worse, get out as fast as you can. Seriously.Also, any one of the "incidents" that occurred in the house would have been enough for them (or at least for the wife) to say "I'm out of here! I'm not staying here another second". But no, she kept staying in house all alone. Go to a friend's house or to the cheapest motel you can find... whatever, just don't stay there! I mean, they did move out eventually right?! Are we supposed to believe they couldn't do it before but after everything that inspired the house's value went up? It's ridiculous!I wish the makers of this movie cared more about the quality of it, instead of trying too hard to make it new and edgy. A good horror thriller is hard to find anyways so better to care more about quality than originality.Cast did a good job but the stupid behavior and unexplained questions made it into a bad movie.6/10And in case you are wondering here are the biggest plot holes and unanswered questions: Why was this guy in such a bad shape (both physically and mentally)? Why live in the walls for so long? Why didn't the police do a DNA test on the clearly unidentifiable corpse? Why did he kill the sister? Why wasn't anyone looking for the sister? And don't give me that one text message as an excuse because that's nowhere near enough. Why didn't the dog catch the intruder? Like for example when he put the tennis ball on the bed (she was out of the room for exactly ten seconds which mean the intruder was real close by). Dogs would know a stranger is in the house. Why was he harassing and attacking the two in the first place? Why poison the husband and attack the wife? Why try and kill them? What's his story? I can go on and on but lastly (like I've already mentioned): WHY DO YOU KEEP STAYING THERE?? The car, the message on the mirror, the music, the water, the pornography, the tennis ball, the text messages, the photos, the THREE separate attacks, the dog... Do you really need to be chained to a wall before you decide to move out? One, two, maybe three incidents I get but everything? I wouldn't leave the house because the mirror or the pornography because it's hard to make a connection but the tennis ball and the photos of you sleeping?? Come on! It's idiotic!But hey, thankfully the ending was happy... One month later and they were all smiles. The deaths, the traumas, the financial problems, the marital problems... All went away with a flip of a finger (literally). Laughable!"

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10696784/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," "Well, now there's us..., and there's y'all." ","I happen to belong to that school of thought that says I've never seen a Western I didn't like. As I come here for this review, "The Harder They Fall" only merits a 6.0 rating from over four thousand viewers, and that to me seems considerably on the low side. Although the film really doesn't break any new ground in the area of story telling, I did find it highly entertaining and enjoyable. As I read some of the more negative reviews, there seems to be a preponderance of those who can't accept the idea of black cowboys in the Old West, but even a modest internet search will reveal that there were plenty, many of them freed slaves who went West following the Civil War. And it's not like the concept has never been attempted before. As far back as the Thirties, there were a handful of all Black Western films starring Herb Jeffries as a singing cowboy who's voice sounded to me a lot like Gene Autry.The Tarantino influence is fairly evident in this picture. There's a lot of stylized violence and the song track is updated for a modern day hip-hop, reggae experience. For some, that would take the viewer right out of the story since the culture clash is right in your face, but I didn't find it all that distracting. What's novel here is a story about two outlaw gangs that go up against each other with the primary motivation being what it usually is - money, lots of it, and who it belongs to. The Nat Love (Jonathan Majors) gang finds itself allied with legendary lawman Bass Reeves (Delroy Lindo), a name most wouldn't be familiar with, including myself up until a few ago. As a real historical figure, Reeves operated as a lawman in the post-Civil War Territory of Oklahoma, arresting over three thousand outlaws and killing fourteen men.Opposing the Love Gang is an outlaw bunch that goes by the name of Crimson Hood, led by the notorious Rufus Buck (Idris Elba). Buck is a prisoner when we first meet him, making his escape when Trudy Smith (Regina King) and Cherokee Bill (LaKeith Stanfield) free him from a prison train. There's a connection between Buck and Love that's not readily apparent when they first come across each other, although observant Western fans might figure it out right out of the gate. Once it starts, the showdown between the rival desperadoes hits a fever pitch in the town of Maysville, Texas. It's where the androgynous Cuffee (Danielle Deadwyler) makes a transformative appearance in a red dress to help Nat Love rob a bank in order to settle a score with Rufus Buck. He/she also surprises with an unseen quick draw on Cherokee Bill that takes him out of the story, a character actually that I was sorry to see who didn't make it to the end of the picture.In any event, I thought the film was a blast, and was happy to catch it on it's Netflix debut last night. If it serves the purpose of inspiring a search into the history of black cowboys and the aforementioned All Black Western film genre, it will have done a nice side job to that of standing well on it's own. Just getting back to Herb Jeffries a minute, the pictures he appeared in play like virtually thousands of old B Westerns of the era, but the fact that he's in an all black cast is what makes it unusual. If you'd like a recommendation, try "Two Gun Man From Harlem", one of my favorites."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10696784/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," An impressive modern western ","As this western opens a reverend, his wife and their ten year old son are sitting down for dinner when a man, with associates, comes to the door. He clearly has a grudge to settle with the reverend. The woman then the reverend are gunned down before the man cuts the boy's forehead with a razor.Years pass and the boy, Nat Love, has become a man. He is operating on the wrong side of the law; although he and his gang target other thieves rather than robbing banks himself. He has also been hunting down those who killed his parents; apart from Rufus Buck, the actual killer, who is rotting in Yuma Jail. One day Buck is being transferred by train and is sprung by his gang; they return to their hometown of Redwood. Nat's latest robbery has left them desperately short of funds. Buck wants the money back with interest and Love wants his revenge. Inevitably the two gangs will clash and many involved will not survive.I first heard of this film when I read a news article about a soon to be released mostly black western; I like the genre and wondered how it would compare to more traditional westerns. It might not be the best western I've seen but it is far from the worst and to be honest the race of the characters doesn't affect the story. The characters are nicely varied; the villains are bad but not unsympathetic and the heroes are mostly good but hardly pure. Jonathan Majors impresses as Nat Love and Idris Elba is great as Rufus Buck. The rest of the cast is impressive; I particularly liked Zazie Beetz as Stagecoach Mary, Regina King as Trudy Smith, Danielle Deadwyler as Cuffee and Delroy Lindo as Marshal Bass Reeves. Writer/Director Jeymes Samuel is clearly a fan of the genre; capturing the classic feel of westerns with more modern attitudes to realistic violence and some salty language. The action is impressive and at times fairly bloody. There is a degree of humour, enough to make me laugh without getting in the way of the action. I was particularly amuse by Marysville; a 'white town' where the people are white, the buildings are painted white and even the dust is white! There are some flaws of course; at almost two hours twenty minutes it is a bit too long. Some people might not be keen on the reggae sound track but I thought it worked surprisingly well. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to fans of westerns; it may have all black leads and several strong female characters but doesn't feel 'politically correct' or preachy because it is a cracking story."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10696784/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," The harder I fell ","I expected far more from this new Blaxploitation film, because I crave for the seventies ones. But in this time, it was different, more social, more daring and authentic. Here, I like the characters where the bad guys are shown as if they were good ones, where supporting characters have as much depth as the lead ones. Some splendid moments but unfortunately jeopardized by lousy sound, music and slow motion effects in action scenes, too Western Spaghetti for me. In the seventies, Blaxploitation did not mix up with spaghetti, which was also a genre in fashion at the same time; and maybe that's why it did not melt. The lousy way of filming is too modern for me who compares with the old Blaxploitation. But it's not a bad film, far from that. It only doesn't fit whith what I expected, that's all. Idris Elba is excellent as the bad guy. He steals the role from the lead good guy."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10696784/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," It's OK, without the corral... ","I suppose the underlying message here is that not all real cowboys looked like John Wayne or Jimmy Stewart.... Otherwise, it's a pretty weakly structured story of revenge that, unfortunately, left me pretty cold. It starts in the home of a preacher having a family supper when in comes a man, wielding two golden guns. He quickly dispatches the parents, and carves the young son with a cross on his forehead. Shift on twenty years and this young boy "Nat" (Jonathan Majors), having tracked down and killed all the other members of the gang, discovers that their leader (Idris Elba) has escaped from prison and so his final plan for revenge is soon in play. Problem with this is that there are just far too many characters, most of whom add virtually nothing to the pretty standard, indeed really quite contrived, central narrative. Elba has no menace whatsoever, and the supporting cast all seem to lack any real commitment to their roles. Often, it is as if they are offering performances consistent with a big budget, but fairly run-of-the-mill television movie. Feisty Zazie Betts ("Mary Fields") makes for quite a decent, entertaining, denouement with Regina King's ("Trudy Smith") but otherwise, this is a long old two hours of ordinary film-making with a really rather disappointing conclusion."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10696784/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Black western hits the marks ","As "The Harder They Fall" (2021 release; 137 min.) opens, we are reminded that "Although These Events Are Fictional, These. People. Existed." We watch as a Black family in the remote West sometime in the mid-to-late 19th century is about to have dinner, someone knocks on the door. We have no idea who this is, but the guy goes on to brutally murder the parents in front of the young son, who for good measure gets a cross cut into his forehead. We then go to "Salinas, Texas, Some Time Later", and the young boy is now a grown man (still with the cross scar on his forehead), named Nat Love, and part of the Love gang. He is searching for the killer of his parents, and it's not long before all hell breaks loose... At this point we are 10 min into the film.Couple of comments: this is the feature-length debut of British musician Jaymes Samuel (brother of singer Seal). Jay-Z is credited as one of the producers. Samuel brings us a Black western, in which there is very little room for whites (the only sequence with whites is the train heist). The movie is highly stylish and very visual. I had no idea of any of this when I walked into the theater. I was simply looking for a good movie, and I was surprised how much I enjoyed it all. The movie features an all-star cast of Black performers, none more so than Jonathan Majors ("The Last Black Man in San Francisco"), as Nat Love, although Regina King (as one of the many bad-asses in the movie) also shines in her own way. Please note that the violence is in your face, if not over the top, almost Quentin Tarantino-like. In fact, this film reminded me on more than one occasion of the great Tarantino, and that's saying something. The movie features a bunch of great song placements and I can't wait for the soundtrack (which will be released in early November). The only criticism I have is that the film's running time is unnecessarily long at 2 hrs. 20 min and could easily have been trimmed by 20-30 minutes without losing anything essential, but in the end it's a minor quibble."The Harder They Fall" premiered in early October at the London film festival to immediate acclaim. There is a reason why this film currently is rated 87% certified fresh on Rotten Tomatoes. The movie was released in theaters this weekend for a limited run before it moves to Netflix in early November. Thankfully my art-house theater here in Cincinnati had it on its lineup. The Friday early evening screening where I saw this at was not attended well (exactly 2 people including myself), which is a shame. If you are in the mood for a highly stylish, at times Tarantino-reminding Black western, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater (while you still can), on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10696784/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Gunslingers in the Hood ","Iris Elba, Regina King and the beautiful Zazie Beetz lead a strong cast in this epic Western with a seemingly endless cast of thousands and that is the problem. Too many characters within a routine spaghetti western of the kind made by Sergio Leone in the 1960s and later by Clint Eastwood and Quentin Tarantino, whose influence is obvious. Every other line contains QT's catchphrase "mother******." It is unnecessary and distracting. I was worn out after the two hours plus running time and wished that the editor had tightened things up a bit. In spite of my criticisms, The Harder They Fall is a decent throwback cowboy movie."

Idris plays a bad_to_the_bone outlaw that kills Jonathan's parents. Jonathan was 10 years old at the time but when he gets older, he goes after his revenge on Idris and his bad_to_the_bone gang. Jonathan picks the gang members off, one by one, but by the time he gets to Idris, Idris is in prison for life, so, out of his reach. Regina is Idris' girlfriend-and the leader of Idris' gang, in his absence-and she gets their gang to break Idris out. Jonathan hears about this and gets his own gang together-including his girlfriend, Zazie-and decides to go after Idris and finish his revenge plans. Although it's pretty violent, there is some humor-one of the funniest jokes is when the outlaws raid a 'White Town'-and there are a couple of Black comedians that have cameos. There is not much new here but it is an entertaining experience.It's rated "R" for violence and language & has a running time of 2 hours & 10 minutes.I would probably buy it on DVD."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10696784/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," The Harder They Fall ","After a shocking flashback beginning, anti hero outlaw Majors discovers that his enemy, the vile Idris Alba has escaped from prison and sets out to bring him down and reassembles his old gang to do this.Easy to dismiss this as Tarantinoesque which in many ways it is, but director and co-writer Samuel has created a glorious visual feast of a western, with terrific, mostly African American - particularly LaKeith Stanfield - actors playing a group of memorable characters. It is full of great action scenes and a wonderfully dark sense of humour and backed up with a memorable soundtrack of individual songs and background music. Interestingly this is brutal film, but not as excessive as Tarantino and also remarkably light on strong language. Alba is fabulous as the truly ghastly, ruthless Rufus Buck well supported by Regina King and his final speech which takes us back to the cause of Major's strong hatred is surprisingly moving. A terrific fun western."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10696784/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Stylish and brutal, but also overlong with not much character resonance. ","Orphaned at a young age by the Rufus Buck Gang, Nat Love (Johnathan Majors) has grown up to form his own gang and has killed the last man who killed his parents while Rufus Buck (Idris Elba) rots in prison and now seeks to rekindle his relationship with former partner and lover Stagecoach Mary (Zazie Beetz). Rufus Buck's lieutenants, Trudy Smith (Regina King) and Cherokee Bill (Lakeith Stanfield) make a deal with the government in exchange for a pardon for Rufus Buck, and Buck and his gang head to the all-black town of Redwood City and remove the corrupt sheriff and former member of Buck's gang, Wiley Escoe (Deon Cole) from power asserting the town under Rufus Buck's authority. When Nat Love gets wind that Rufus Buck is free and rebuilding his power, Love reassembles his gang with Mary, Jim Beckwourth (RJ Cyler), Bill Pickett (Edi Gathegi), and Cuffee (Danielle Deadwyler) with help from U. S. Marshal Bass Reeves (Delroy Lindo) who's mutually interested in taking down Rufus Buck.Since appearing on the scene in supporting roles in films like Hostiles and White Boy Rick and the TV docudrama miniseries When We Rise playing Young Ken Jones, Johnathan Majors has slowly but surely become a major actor to look out for scoring leads in the short lived HBO horror series Lovecraft Country as well as appearing to strong acclaim in the likes of films such as Da 5 Bloods and The Last Black Man in San Francisco. Produced Will Smith's Overbrook Entertainment, Musician Shawn Carter (aka Jay-Z), and frequent Quentin Tarantino collaborator Lawrence Bender, the movie is the feature directing debut of musician/music producer Jeymes Samuel who supervised the soundtrack for Baz Luhrmann's The Great Gatspy and co-wrote the script with Boaz Yakin. The movie features a predominantly black cast and strives to be a stylish musically infused take on gritty revenge westerns and the movie certainly has all the right pieces in place to do so. Unfortunately while the movie has all the right ingredients, they don't come together as well as you want them to.Stylistically speaking the movie looks amazing, the cinematography and costuming is gorgeous with these very colorful western towns brought to life and integrated with an energized soundtrack helping establish its identity out of the gate. The opening scene where we see Nat Love as a child witness the murder of his parents by Rufus Buck is amazingly done because you don't see Rufus Buck's face as he's shot mostly from the back or from over the shoulder giving him an imposing presence as an antagonist. When the movie does reveal Idris Elba about 40 minutes in where he steps out from the shadows in a well-choreographed train heist sequences that's both tense as well as stylish it's probably one of the best villain introductions I've seen in a modern western. The action is also quite well done with the impacts nicely conveyed and real sense of brutality to is given to them (especially a scene where Rufus Buck pistol whips a corrupt sheriff in front of a terrified town).Unfortunately once the novelty of the style wears off after the strong opening introduction the movie becomes less and less engaging as it goes on. A big issue with The Harder They Fall is in its length because the movie clocks in at 2 hours and 19 minutes when it would be better served by being 1 hour and 40 minutes at most. The movie is a pretty straight forward revenge story, and while sometimes those can justify their length (such as Kill Bill Vol.1 and 2) The Harder They Fall doesn't have the writing or character needed to justify its length down to the fact the movie manufactures a conflict with Stagecoach Mary doing a pretty ill advised action which leads her getting captured by Buck where Buck forces Nat Love to rob a bank in a white town (both literally and figuratively) which seems like it's only there to stretch the story to this length. You can tell the movie is directed by someone with a music background because not only is the soundtrack often front and center, but several scenes feel like they're one step away from turning into musical numbers (which actually does happen every so often) and while the look can sometimes be to this film's advantage such as the colorful buildings that make up Redwood City, othertimes it becomes quite distracting such as the previously mentioned white town where everything, and I do mean everything is painted white in what I guess is supposed to be a joke, but it's such a broad and exaggerated joke it feels like something that should be in a parody and not in a (somewhat) serious western.Most of the performances are kind of lost among the style and excess of the rest of the movie. The one major standout who I thought gave a really strong performance was Delroy Lindo playing a fictionalized take on U. S. Marshal Bass Reeves and while the role isn't written with all that much depth, Lindo gives the character this world weariness that gives some needed weight and investment to the film and gave the character a lot of credibility thanks to his performance. Idris Elba gets a decent introduction with a really strong train robbery set piece, but after that sequence he doesn't really get to do all that much until the very end of the movie which doesn't strike the emotional resonance it should. Johnathan Majors is serviceable as the lead, but he's also not really called upon for any commanding moments where he's allowed to own the scene and often is just sort of "there". Majors' Nat Love character has both a revenge plot as well as a romantic plot with Zazie Beetz' Stagecoach Mary and neither Nat Love's revenge nor his relationship with Stagecoach Mary really comes to a boiling point and feels like it's stuck on a mild simmer more than anything else.The Harder they Fall certainly is stylish and well made, but it's also not as substantive as it needs to be to justify its near 2 and hour length. I think Jeymes Samuel does have merit as a director and I would like to see him do another movie, but he also needs an editor that can keep his vision focused. There's a strong performance from Delroy Lindo and some forceful fight sequences and if you are a fan of westerns or Tarantino films this might be worth a one time viewing, but I can't really give it much more than that."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10696784/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Ambiguous yet too flawed to truly kick off, this is a western that you'll either like or dislike and my opinion is mixed ","The Harder They Fall is director Jeymes Samuel's feature film debut and it shows, the direction is very flawed. But the vision he has for the film deserves praise as he strides to make a visually good looking film and he succeeded with that, he co-wrote the screenplay with Boaz Yakin who is known for blockbusters. The writing is flawed but overall good, except for most of the dialogue. But one thing that I absolutely loved about the film is of course the cinematography, Mihai Malaimare Jr's work is yet again mesmerizing. Having worked as a cinematographer for films like The Master and Jojo Rabbit.With it being one of very few Westerns whose principal cast members are all African-American, it's a fictional story with most actors playing historical figures. But it's pure fiction and the writing could have been better. Yet a western film with African American actors and characters is nice to see and is played by some great actors, the performances ranges from great to okey. Idris Elba, Jonathan Majors, Regina King and Delroy Lindo are among the best.The film stars Jonathan Majors, Idris Elba, Zazie Beetz, Regina King, Delroy Lindo, Lakeith Stanfield, RJ Cyler, Danielle Deadwyler, Edi Gathegi and Deon Cole. The story follows outlaw Nat Love as he discovers that his enemy Rufus Buck is being released from prison he rounds up his gang to track Rufus down and seek revenge. Those riding with him in this assured, righteously new school Western include his former love Stagecoach Mary, his right and left hand men hot-tempered Bill Pickett and fast drawing Jim Beckwourth and a surprising adversary-turned-ally. Rufus Buck has his own fearsome crew, including "Treacherous" Trudy Smith and Cherokee Bill, and they are not a group that knows how to lose.The Harder They Fall is a film I really looked forward to watch and did it meet ny expectations? Nope, I found myself bored at times because of the pacing was terrible. Lots of scenes could have been trimmed down. The dialogue wasn't strong enough and therefore, the jokes fell flat. The sets and locations used in this film was so nice, bringing quality to the film. Just wished the costume department would have been on the same level. The action sequences has some Quentin Tarantino vibes but without the great camera angles, though the cinematography and how many of the scenes are shot, it's a great looking film, artistically. But the action sequences had the potential to be great but ended up okey. Something I disliked was the soundtrack, mainly because how it's not fitting well with the western genre, fitting more the crime genre. Much of the film feels that way, Jeymes Samuel could have created a great crime film but instead he did a western without any thought of historical accuracy or of the overall authenticity. Honestly, the director seems too inspired by Quentin Tarantino's style of making movies which is a hard thing to copy, his direction is far from great as his and his writing is far from great as Tarantino's. Enough of negativity, I absolutely think that Jeymes Samuel has the potential to become a good filmmaker but this wasn't a great film. Great looking, yes. I also think that the second half of the film is pretty good, but the first half needs to be trimmed immensely to fix the pacing."

This epic western with a predominantly black cast is one of the best films of 2021; a rollicking old-school adventure with an anachronistic soundtrack, masses of shoot outs and a brilliant cast tearing up the screen. To put it bluntly, it rules.The film begins when ten year old Nat Love is traumatised by the murder of his parents, gunned down at the family dinner table by "the Devil himself," gang boss Rufus Buck. Years later, the adult Love (Jonathan Majors - excellent) confronts one of Buck's gang at a Church. He riddles him with bullet holes, sending the despicable villain spiralling through the air with blood spraying. Love then suggests the vicar capitalise by taking the body to collect the $3000 bounty."Why don't you collect it," asks the vicar."I'm worth ten," Love grins.From this searing introduction, the film expands into a riotously entertaining western with an incredible ensemble cast. Majors is the coolest cowboy to ever pull on the spurs, but he's also a complex and conflicted character whose arc develops in unexpected and enthralling ways. As the villainous Buck, Idris Elba excels, playing against type as a cold and ruthless killer who burns up the screen, even in the scenes where his face isn't shown.They're supported by a cast including Lakeith Stanfield's quietly psychotic Cherokee Bill, Zazie Beetz' hard-as-nails Stagecoach Mary and perhaps best of all, Regina King's dynamite performance as Trudy Smith. As Buck's second-in-command, King is a formidable villain, almost as dastardly as her boss and she comes within a whisker of stealing the entire film.Throw in some blistering gunfights, tense stand-offs and a hilarious detour into "a white town" and you've got two and a half hours of sheer cinematic joy. The soundtrack kicks, the cast give it their all, the action is top notch and there's a surprising emotional heft too, especially in the latter half. There will be other films that come out this year which get rated higher, but none of them will see Delroy Lindo walking down a main street in a full-length duster coat, gunning down everyone he sets eyes on. The Harder They Fall kicks ass and I for one had a great time."

Bill has a suspect but no one is willing to help. He befriends a young girl named Maya and her mother Virginie (Camille Cottin) helps him as his translator.First, the elephant in the room is the complaint by Amanda Knox. She's entitled to her feelings and I'm sure that it feels bad to have other people take advantage of her story. While this story has some similarities, there are big differences from her story. In addition, this is the father's story more than the daughter's story. Amanda may feel exploited but at best, she is the starting inspiration for the writing of this story.The most compelling aspect is to make this MAGAian character as a sympathetic lead. The world is grinding him down but he still struggles on. He is Sisyphus. Their mantra becomes Life is Brutal. For the movie's first 2/3, his struggling to save his daughter is very compelling. His friendship with Maya is very sweet. The better way to wrap this up would be a sweet tragic turn with Maya. The turn it actually does is too convenient, too setup by the movie, and the movie had moved on. It clashes but I'm willing to live with it until the further twist comes. The twist is a real problem and it retroactively destroys some of the movie's first 2/3. Breslin would be acting differently and her explanation is a little light.

Damon is very good in the role - an hard as nails father determined at all costs to seek justice. Somehow, though, his daughter "Allison" (Abigail Breslin) fails to engender one tiny bit of sympathy for her plight. I couldn't have cared less if she were never to see the light of day again - regardless of her innocence or otherwise. The film also flounders on a rather flawed premiss that somehow France is some romantic, fairy tale setting that ought not to be a match for this rough American. Anyone ever been to Marseille? It is as rough a place as exists anywhere, and has been for a very long time - so his difficulties are not only compounded, but the film loses a great deal of it's credibility. On the plus side, there is quite a delicate relationship demonstrated between him, "Virginie" (Camille Cottin) and her adorable little girl "Maya" (Lilou Siauvaud) but the ending is so weak, hurried and disappointing as to render the whole thing little better than a mystery in which nobody cares who did what to whom - and I suspect neither Stillwater nor Marseille would be overly impressed with the way the cities were shown here. A film for television, i'd say."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10696896/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," oklahoma fish out of water ","Greetings again from the darkness. It's understandable if you are taken in by a trailer that hints at a movie featuring an unknown dad going non-stop in cold pursuit of justice for his daughter (those numerous Liam Neeson references were for my own pleasure). In fact, this father has his own particular set of skills: he's a master at carpentry and electrical, he speaks the Oklahoma version of English, and he owns two guns (neither of which he has with him). And yes, this film is billed as a crime thriller, but you should know, we see very little crime, and the thrills are mostly non-existent. Despite all that, I connected with the story, not as a thriller, but rather as a character study of a flawed man trying to do the right thing by his daughter and find redemption for himself.Oscar winner Matt Damon plays Bill Baker, a quiet out of work oil worker whom we first see on a clean-up crew after a disastrous tornado. Not long after, he's on an international flight to Marseille to visit his daughter Allison (Abigail Breslin). She's been incarcerated for five years after being found guilty of stabbing her French-Arab lover, Lina, to death. In a highly publicized trial, Allison held fast to her claim of innocence, and still does. Her father visits regularly, delivering supplies and clean laundry. Although they hug on the visits, a definite chasm exists. We later learn that Bill previously struggled with drugs and alcohol and never received votes for Father of the Year. Allison asks her father to deliver a sealed letter to her attorney claiming there is new evidence in her case - she heard a guy named Akim had bragged at a party about committing Lina's murder.You likely noticed the similarities to the 2007 Amanda Knox case. The differences being that was Italy, this is France; and it was Amanda's roommate, not lover. In this movie, the media fascination is derived from the 'rich' entitled American white girl brutally murdering her minority working class lesbian lover (a textbook Hollywood rendering). Allison growing up poor in Oklahoma mattered little to the media.Damon plays Bill as a stoic, Heartland of America man who'll do anything for "his little girl". But he's no Jason Bourne. He's the proverbial fish-out-of-water on this mission. He doesn't speak a bit of French, and depends on the kindness of local actress Virginie (Camille Cottin, ALLIED, 2016) to be his interpreter and cultural guide in a world he doesn't comprehend. Bill quickly bonds with Virginie's precocious daughter Maya (a sterling film debut by Lilou Siauvaud), and soon a platonic family unit has formed. Bill's frequent prayers and odd American manners are the perfect cultural clash with Virginie's artsy French ways. Of course, this ultimately leads to a shift in the platonic nature of their relationship.The film is directed by Tom McCarthy, an Oscar winner for SPOTLIGHT (2015). I highly recommend two of his other films, the excellent THE VISITOR (2007), and his sinfully under-seen directorial debut THE STATION AGENT (2003). McCarthy co-wrote this script with Marcus Hinchey, Thomas Bidegain, and Noe Debre, which explains why the French details are so spot on. Cinematographer Masanobu Takayanagi delivers brilliant camera work to go with the story's methodical pacing, and Mychael Danna's music adds intensity and depth to situations both quiet and fraught with emotion. Damon does some of his best work here as a man burdened with his own past and slowly becoming aware of possible personal and family life redemption. Ms. Breslin burst on the scene in 2006 with LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE, and she has transitioned well to adult roles ... though this role is somewhat abbreviated, she still does nice work in her scene with Maya and Virginie.Bill and Virginie and Maya have some terrific segments together, including a dance to Sammi Smith's "Help Me Make it Through the Night". I'm guessing the rousing applause the film and actors received at Cannes was due partly to its French setting, and also to the depth of Bill's character (and Damon's performance). There are elements that seem far-fetched and maybe even overly complex, but viewed as the story of one man, it delivers some thought-provoking topics to the big screen. And yes, "life is brutal".Opens in Theaters Friday, July 30."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10696896/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Good film, worthwhile. ","Stillwater is an engaging and likable film in totality, without particular moments to highlight.From writer and director of 2003's "The Station Agent," Tom McCarthy. Bill's daughter effectively damned him. He who couldn't be counted on, but changed his whole way of life for her and now home, no longer such. Damon toning down his performance in the role. The film isn't predictable at all as a whole, but the soccer match entirely so. He would obviously see the guy and be responsible for Maya at the same time, so not too creative there. One of the better films of the year though."

","There is a grim determinism at work in "Stillwater," arguably one of the slowest paced and most depressing films in recent memory.Much of the first half of the film is taken up with the granite block of man named Bill Baker (Matt Damon) striding the steep walkways of Marseilles, France, in search of a solution for his imprisoned daughter, Allison, convicted in the murder of her roommate and lover Lina.The film may have been inspired by the lurid story of Amanda Knox, an American living in Italy who was accused of murdering her British roommate. But "Stillwater" has no dramatic trial scene to add a twist of drama. It is rather a semi-vigilante film with Bill attempting the impossible in securing a DNA sample of a young man to prove the innocence of his daughter.The filmmakers aspired to evoke an arty European-style film, veering from the plot in the interest of mood. But the best part of the film was the realistic conversation and deep bonding between father and daughter.The unsympathetic daughter Allison seems ungrateful that her father risked everything to spring her out of a French prison. Ultimately, Allison speaks the main tag line of the film: "Life is brutal."Allison acknowledges that she and her dad are destined to live lives of desperation. Their DNA is of the loser variety. The deep, dark secrets of Allison Baker are finally revealed at the end. Allison will live haunted with the death of dear Lina. For the shattered dad, the only possible response is: "Life is brutal.""

",""Stillwater" is one okay drama type suspense film of a father wanting to find out the truth with a case that involves his daughter. The film is a travel seek and find one that tries it's best to fight for justice, yet I for one felt the picture to be to long and in depth. Anyway Matt Damon is Bill a blue collar rural class working dad from Oklahoma who travels to France to look into a murder case that involves his daughter Allison(Abigail Breslin) a college exchange student. And Bill believes that his daughter has wrongly been accused and serving false prison time. The investigation and search seeking reveals people and clues only to twist and leave a viewer asking questions and thinking doubt. Along the way the film is spiced up some with Bill's intimate relationship with Virginie(Camille Cottin) a French stage actress. Overall nothing great still the movie tries to be long and in depth as it makes this an interesting mystery suspense type film that will leave the viewer still asking questions."

The interpretation of Matt Damon who played as Bill Baker was simply amazing and he made the difference in this movie. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Camille Cottin's who played as Virginie, Lilou Siauvaud's who played as Maya and Abigail Breslin's who played as Allison. In conclusion, I have to say that "Stillwater" is a breathtaking movie that will keep you in tense through its whole duration and I highly recommend everyone to watch it."

Basically it is a dramatic movie like the French are known for, with lots of attention for the characters and a slow build up of the story.This is a movie about family bonds, family love and how to repent ones sins of the past... This is not a thriller. Not a detective either. It is a slowburning, delicate portrait of a roughneck (Matt Damon, oil driller / builder) who is desperate to proof the innocence of his daughter who has been accused of murder and is improsined in France.The bad: there are 2 very dramatic moments that are completely rushed, without any explanation. Very strange, but not that irritating, that it brings down the whole movie. The film is at moments quite slow. But never really becomes tedious, that is to say if you like a CHARACTER PORTRAIT.

","As "Stillwater" (2021 release; 140 min.) opens, we are introduced to Bill Baker, an erstwhile oil rig worker now in between jobs. Baker is flying into Marseille again, for a(nother) 2 week stay there to visit his daughter Allison, who has already spent 5 years in jail for the murder of her girlfriend. Allison swears she is innocent. Meanwhile Baker gets to know his neighbor in the hotel, Virginie and her 9 yr. Old daughter Maya. Virginie actually speaks English, so that is quite helpful. When Baker meets with Allison's lawyer, he gets the news no parent wants to get: the lawyer basically has given up, and Baker is on his own... At this point we are less than 15 min. Into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience. You'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the first film from writer-director Tom McCarthy since his Oscar-winning "Spotlight" some 4-5 years ago. With a name like that attached to the film, not to mention the lead star Matt Damon, no slouch himself, I was intrigued by the film. Add Abigail "Little Miss Sunshine" Breslin as Allison, and you have all the necessary elements for a great movie. The movie's title "Stillwater" is quite misleading as in fact about 90% of the movie plays out in sprawling Marseilles. A critical scene in the movie plays out while the local soccer team Olympique Marseille plays a home game at the infamous Velodrome. It is clear that filming is done while an actual game is taking place, this is not staged, and hence adding to the authenticity of the scene. Alas, there are also some other aspects of the movie that do not work so well. Is this a "will she get out of jail" movie? Or is it more a troubled father-daughter relationship movie? Or perhaps yet something else? Also this: as soon as the movie started playing, it felt like I was familiar in a vague sense with this story, and hence I assumed that this was based on a true story. But nothing in the film credits acknowledges this. It didn't take me long afterwards to piece two and two together. The movie is in fact loosely based/a fictionalized version of the real life Amanda Knox story."Stillwater" was supposed to be released in theaters in Fall of 2020, but a little thing called COVID-19 had other plans. The movie finally was in theaters last weekend. The Friday early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was not attended well, just 5 people (including myself). If you are a fan of Tom McCarthy or Matt Damon, or simply are in the mood for a complex if imperfect drama, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10696896/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Long and a little too simple ","'Stillwater' has a very simple plot. When the film began I was getting 'Taken' vibes, but it was very different to that. The film is primarily a drama and very few others genres could really be argued. Crime and even thriller are a bit of stretch. The film is also very long. Very few modern films can justify a 2 hour 20 minute length. On this occasion it was bearable, but it certainly took away any chance of being re-watched.The acting is quite strong in this one. There are some pretty good characters at the heart of the movie which really helps to carry things, considering there is very little in the way of story for large portions of the film. Matt Damon's character is very understated and quiet, but he is also very likeable - largely in part to Damon's likability.The film is called 'Stillwater' and I'm not really sure why - very little of the film is actually set there. I also felt the ending was quite rushed, which is unforgivable when the film is as long as it is. This is a decent film that is watchable, but far from must-see material. 6/10."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10696896/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Not A Lot Of Action Here ","I saw "Stillwater", starring Matt Damon-Ford v Ferrari, True Grit_2010; Camille Cottin-Call My Agent_tv, I Kissed a Girl; Abigail Breslin-the Zombieland movies, Signs and Lilou Siauvaud-this is her first movie.This movie is loosely based on the Amanda Knox story-I say loosely because I've heard that she is not too happy with it. Matt plays an Oklahoma oil 'roughneck' that travels to France to try to help his estranged daughter, Abigail. It seems that Abigail is in a French prison, accused of murdering a girl. She claims that she was framed but has been in prison for 5 years. Camille and her daughter, Lilou befriend Matt when he reaches France and try to help him in his quest for justice. Stillwater is the name of the town in Oklahoma that Matt is from. It's a study of how far a parent will go to help his daughter but it is not in the 'Bourne' or 'Taken' action genre-not a lot of action here, in fact, when someone asks Matt if he has a gun he says, 'Yeah, I have 2 of them, but I left them at home.' It's rated "R" for language and sexual content-including partial nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 19 minutes.It's not one that I would buy on DVD. I don't know if I would rent it, either but if you are interested in seeing it, I'd wait until it comes to cable."

STILLWATER is as hard-hat, in-you-face, blue-collar as GOOD WILL HUNTING. It deserves highest marks for warning Americans to stay out of the foreign regions that our President decreed to be "S-hole" nations, such as Italy, Greece and France. As deftly documented in STILLWATER, the latter failed country lacks the basics of Civilization, such as adequate room keys, working lights, flush toilets or a language that makes sense. Worse yet, these backwards societies go out of their way to railroad innocent Americans into tiny prison cells on trumped up murder charges at the drop of a hat. But even outside of such deplorable jails, the absolute squalor, soiled surroundings, crumbling edifices, claustrophobic confinement, musty milieu and mildewed furnishings depicted throughout this film cry out to all right-thinking U.

It is a gripping and sensitive story. The locations and costume perfectly recreate the stiffness of the post WW2 period.

When it started though, I was quickly taken by the visuals. the camera work is great, it is a really good looking film.While Starting in pre-World War 2 Sweden and running into the 1950s, the subject matter is timely and relevant globally, and even today in the United States given recent revelations.Without giving too many spoilers, Dr. August Persson works as a surgeon supporting a Government program. When he decides to raise a child that is not his after his estranged wife dies in child birth, his world is turned upside down when his daughter becomes entangled in the very program he is part of.There are great performances by the leads - Dr Perrson and his daughter Elin, but also some scene stealers in the supporting cast. The assistant to the Minister and the Nurse ooze drama and suspense even in brief appearances. Dr. Persson's son Gustav also shines in his scenes.Part Historical family drama, but more so, a timeless harrowing story of a man who is forced to confront decades of his past and his worldview, but only after he is personally affected. I will be looking for more from this filmmaker."

Shot and directed superbly with a great subtly in the obvious, which shows great skill of craft. Very few films so acutely grasp the concept of identity and the need not just for survival but survival within in our own skin. The contrast between the two main characters, who are played superbly, shows the fragility of 'knowing who we are' and that even under medical evaluation of ourselves, and coming to a conclusion that might even ostracise us from the larger populous we still might not even then be who we think we are...throughout the film questions are rife; does it take force to find oneself or lose oneself? Do we break free the chains of human conditioning and truly know who we are or do we accept we should nay must change to conform. Perhaps most interesting; when confronted by another with such similarities to ones own character; to the point of lust/love (in this case) is this where we only truly understand ourselves; in the mirror that reflects another? In the glass worth looking through? The film does not answer but ask; Do we understand in the end; the need to be fixed or a knowledge we are faulty, or are we so aware of our true identity that there is nothing to be fixed and we must have the courage or lack of it to accept who we are; we all ultimately face the world alone but it takes huge acceptance of oneself to face the wild alone..."

This time, he's made a movie about a woman named Sara. She starts the film by waking up from a coma -- she'd witnessed something traumatic with her parents and attempted suicide -- into a life she doesn't remember. And while her husband seems helpful, there's the hint that he's being a little bit too controlling.How controlling? Well, most of their house is off limits to her and she's constantly followed by her nurse Rose, who is played by V star Jane Balder and let me tell you, I've never seen Ms. Balder play a single heroic or nice person.Also, when our heroine digs up her garden, she finds an intestine growing in it which is just one of the visions she's seeing. Is she still alive? Is she being gaslit by her husband? Has she lost her mind? There's a major shift that comes into the movie, so get ready for it. This is a dark exploration about recovering from suicide as well as the pain men can put into a relationship, so watch it at your own peril."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10703978/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Barmy urban gothic amnesia tale ","Grimmfest 2021Hard to comment without giving it away and honestly, you deserve to go into this one cold and experience it yourself.For the most part, an urban spin on a Daphne DuMaurier style gaslighting tale. We can tell things ain't right but we don't know why or how.The three leads play it straight - Ashmore and the stunning Ms Lando are more than watchable throughout.Then, it careers into its final act and it has to be seen to be believed...Critic proof - a sure fire future cult classic."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10703978/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Ashmore is great, and the movie will keep you off balance ","I saw this as part of the Toronto After Dark Film Festival this year, and I wasn't sure what to expect. It looked like a fairly modestly budgeted horror movie, but I was interested because I liked the two leads (Shawn Ashmore and Narcos's Andrea Londo) and the director's previous film, The Triangle. Still, my expectations were tempered. The gist: a woman has gone through something truly horrific (quite the opening sequence - yikes!), and after attempting suicide she's struggling to regain her memory. Her husband is by her side as she gets stronger, but is he understandably overprotective... or is there more going on in the house?Fortunately this movie - which shifts between psychological thriller and horror - kept me guessing, and it actually did a few things that I (a pretty avid horror watcher) didn't see coming. There were plot elements I suspected by about halfway through, but there's a surrealist quality to the twists that start coming around that midpoint that make that moot, because by then you're so uneasy as the viewer that it doesn't matter if you've guessed a direction. No spoilers: there's a dinner party scene that really starts to make you wonder wtf is going on, in a good way. The writer and director does a very good job at keeping you as off-kilter as the main character is clearly feeling. Who is being gaslighted here, and who's doing the gaslighting? Is it the fragile wife? The controlling husband? Is it the wife's mysteriously absent sister? Or the Danvers-esque housekeeper who seems to have an agenda? And who are the people who keep showing up outside the house...?Bonus points to Ashmore, who plays into the "is he evil/is he protecting her" qualities of his husband role exceptionally well. He walks a thin line and keeps you vacillating between two extremes throughout the film, and it's quite fun to see. Another bonus point for the ending, which threw another angle at me that I hadn't anticipated at all.A strong 7/10 rounded up to an 8 for Ashmore and the truly trippy direction it takes halfway through. It may not be groundbreaking but it's certainly entertaining!"

Virginia (Lottie Amor ) is a friend. Karl ends up taking pictures of the woman (Sarah Barlondo) across the road. He is caught and discovers the woman wants to be photographed. Things go on weirdly and gets bad when he films her with a politician.Another voyeur film. Better than some, worse than others. There is a twist that should have been better developed instead of dropped on us. Lottie Amor did a good job.Guide: F-word, sex, nudity (Lottie Amor, Sarah Barlondo)"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10704342/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," Rizzini directed ","Thomas Law and Sarah Barlondo star in this interesting film about invasion of privacy. My neighbor recently was caught taking a photo of me. He took it over my privacy fence. I was inside the window doing exercises. I did not like it. It was an invasion of privacy. The topic is relevant! This is different in that the woman wanted him to take pictures. She was having an affair and wanted the wife to see the photos. The wife had hired a detective. The photographer, Law, was not an aggressive picture taker for profit. He is innocent. His girlfriend is jealous of the woman at first, but then realizes her boyfriend needs advice. The dialogue is an interesting discussion on privacy and the differences between the sexes. Yes, they agree: the sexes are two different species. More movies like this with intelligent dialogue would be great."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10704342/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Don't call it Voyeurism......okay, yeah, call it Voyeurism ","The new British thriller "Framed" covers a lot of ground. Privacy issues, single female self-sufficiency/independence (as ardently advocated by a fetching Lottie Amor, who needs to be in more movies), frank confirmation that men really do want what woman say men really want aaaand a political scandal tossed in for good measure is plenty to process.The good news is that, all in all, this portrait of a guy (Thomas Law of BBC-TV's "EastEnders") going gaga over a gorgeous neighbor gal through his camera lenses does a summarily snappy job of focusing in on each of these developing plot lines.Labeled a thriller, "Framed" is not so much that as it is an intelligent investigation of the legal and moral boundaries of personal privacy, along with accepting accountability for one's actions, regardless of political standing or status in the social strata.However, in the end, what we really have here is a good old-fashioned love story, featuring a fabulously photogenic young couple.No matter how they're framed.I spoke with "Framed" Writer/Director Nick Rizzini about his film:Q) "Framed" is your first feature film running the whole show as both Writer and Director. What perhaps came as a surprise to you about this new adventure?NR) There is one thing above all that got me by surprise, but I might be the naive one here. I've always had this romantic idea of a film industry where one rarely finds people without passion and motivation for the job. I couldn't be more wrong. And now I understand the value of finding a team of people that have the same approach to the experience. Being an independent filmmaker comes with a quite limited margin for error. Anything that goes wrong can have a huge impact on the movie. In an environment like this you want a team of people that are willing to go the extra mile for the sake of the project. Luckily I had many people in my team with this mentality.Q) Among many themes running through "Framed", the question of ostensibly where one's privacy ends and another's begins is front and center among them. Where do you personally fall in this controversial and inflammatory debate?NR) Personally, I believe balance to be key. Privacy is a huge topic that we need to address in the most careful ways. Framed revolves around a type of privacy that is not anymore at the center of the conversation. Today we are talking more and more about data privacy. I believe in both cases it is important to have an understanding of how our data/image is being used and how important it is to protect it. But we need an understanding of human behaviors too, acknowledging that what we don't protect could potentially be exploited.Q) Female autonomy is another area delved into here, particularly as regards the single character of Virginia, spiritedly brought to life by a vivacious Lottie Amor. Each one of us are independent souls. However, do you believe that staunch, even, at times, militant, feminism runs the risk of deteriorating the special inherent wonder and grace of the female sensibility?NR) In certain cases, I do. And I'm not saying that it's necessarily bad, I'm just saying that one attribute doesn't have to exclude the other. Being completely in love with, as you beautifully put it, "that special inherent wonder and grace of the female sensitivity" I find it sad when it's subdued due to a fear of being a weakness. I actually believe it could be one of the most empowering qualities a woman could have. At least, it has a lot of power over me and I'm sure I'm not the only one.Q) What other aspects of the human condition do you long to bring to the screen as expressions of your vision, Nick?NR) There is not one condition in particular that I'm drawn to, but the way I write it's quite introspective. My approach is highly influenced by my acting background and I feel it will keep on showing up in my scripts. At the moment I'm writing a spy movie set in a cyber warfare scenario. Reading it this way, it sounds like an action movie, but knowing myself I'm sure the humanity behind the structure will take the lead."Framed" is available now on amazon Prime Video."

Highly recommended ","It's rare to find independent feature films that knock it out of the park on all levels. A film (like this one) has to firstly be well scripted, then casted with talented actors who can portray the screenplay's concepts accurately and skillfully. Next, a project requires a team of talented creative professionals (cinematographers, editors, sound engineers, lighting experts) not to mention interesting locations and literal years of work. This film hits on all cylinders and is truly a work of art. Whereas mainstream ''movies" are akin to Rock n Roll I find well done independent films to be more along the lines of jazz or a symphony. These types of films require a higher level of individual skill and passion to compensate for the significantly lower lower budget. This is a really well done film and one that should be supported and will be enjoyed by all."

Girl meets boy with mild threats to their bliss from an ex boyfriend and professional conflicts that are overcome. Post credit scene of them with their eventual children.It's all been done so often. I can only assume the cast of skilled but not famed actors somehow prevailed upon someone somewhere to produce a feature-length sizzle reel for them to show they can play leads after solid careers of one episode guest roles on TV series.

I even enjoyed the music, which is pretty rare for me. You should give it a shot, I rated it 10 because the chemistry between Jason Burkey and Ciara Hanna made me forget that at times is close to your typical "boy meets girl, falls in love, the end" type of movie, I wanted to see more, I wanted to see what happens next, I still had couple of questions unanswered since I saw potential for the story to evolve. I know the ratings and reviews are subject to opinion and taste/like for everyone individually, but I strongly feel like the ratings so far were a bit unjust and it deserves at least a solid 7 if not more, overall, that is the only reason I've decided to write a review, to encourage others to give it a chance before judging it based only on the ratings that didn't leave a review."

The idea of a Hollywood agent with a moral compass breaks the mold. There is no racism - only one black character and one Asian character, both of whom support the hero to the max. I would have liked to know more about their backstories (especially David, the best friend from back home). Any nastiness from the town's "bad guys" comes from common human failings, not because of Alabama roots (thank you). Most TV franchises hope for six seasons and a movie.

I really liked the numerous references to The Alabama Crimson Tide Football Program, Roll Tide Roll. Although the cast did not include any household names, the lead actor (James Maslow) and actress (Ciara Hanna) played their parts well. I can relate to Dixie since most of his thoughts, statements, and actions are similar to my thoughts, statements, and actions. Ciara (Madison) was very beautiful in the movie. The rest of the cast looked like they were playing themselves in the movie. I'm amazed at how a nice, sweet, simple, and short flic became one of my favourite movies."

",""Yakuza Princess" from writers Kimi Lee, Tubaldini Shelling, Fernando Toste and Vicente Amorim was somewhat of a very mixed bag of nuts. And by that I mean that some parts of the storyline were rather interesting, while others were hardly that great. But ultimately, the movie was weighed down by some rather monotonous pacing of the narrative.Now, the storyline told in "Yakuza Princess" had some interesting enough aspects to it, but it wasn't a great movie experience from beginning to end. So it was somewhat of an ordeal to sit through the movie in its entire length and actually not starting to have one's interest in the storyline start to falter.There were some nice action scenes and sword fighting scenes that actually made the movie bearable to sit through. But the performance of Masumi was the icing on the cake, because she was really well cast for the role of Akemi in "Yakuza Princess", and she carried the movie almost single-handedly. The movie also has a nice performance by Tsuyoshi Ihara, Eijiro Ozaki and Jonathan Rhys Meyers."Yakuza Princess" is certainly a watchable movie, but it was a rather tedious one at the same time. And that ultimately leads to my mediocre five out of ten star rating. There are far better movies of a similar nature out there, so "Yakuza Princess" sort of just came and went without much of any ruckus."

It had too much filler and very little substance. Many scenes were too long and/or unnecessary. Was this even edited? The scene transitions were horrible. And all that nonsense mystery didn't help the story either.What this film did have going for it, was decent cinematography, well choreographed fight scenes with awesome gore effects, and excellent performances. Considering this was MASUMI's first full length feature film - as a lead, with only three prior small T. V. roles, she nailed it, wow! I can't wait to see her in more action films, she's a natural. The location and production sets were on point, and the score was fitting and not overbearing as it usually is in many B films.Had this film been cut down to about 90 mins, with better editing and scene transitions, and more character development instead of all the filler, I may have given it an 8 or 9, but as is, it's only a generous 6/10 from me."

I will say this, IF you enjoy movies with a lot of POINTLESS action and fighting then this is your movie, look no further. I myself need a bit of logic with my movie. This one kept my eyes rolling at how lazy the scrip was and it was just laughable at times. Also I hate to say this about any woman but the lead was just not pretty enough to be memorable.

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10715446/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," Undecided ","Depending on what you expect a Yakuza film to be like, this could easily split opinion. If you like classic Yakuza films like Tokyo Drifter, Pale Flower or Sympathy For the Underdog then this will leave you unfulfilled and slightly irritated at the inconsistent pace.If however, you were wanting something more with the feeling that it was inspired by a comic book, then congratulations - this is exactly that. Even if you weren't aware of the Danilo Beyruth graphic novel, you should be able to guess the story origin from the camera work as some of the images are framed in that exact style.The acting is good - Masumi makes credible big-screen debut and Meyers does well in an action-lite kind of way, and the supporting cast do well with what they've been given from an at times weak script. Unfortunately the ending is fairly predictable, and somehow that makes it feel almost unfinished, like half a film despite it's nearly 2 hour length. Perhaps that was the intention of the director, but the preceding 1 hour 51 minutes weren't strong enough to support an inconclusive ending. You make up your own mind!Anyhow, because of that I've only given it 5 stars, but if it was to be maybe a part one of a trilogy with being just a set-up to a meatier storyline to follow, then I would consider changing my rating.With just a bit more pace, attention to the script and a pinch more action (perhaps a re-edit could sort the pace and action issues) this could have been scraping the underside of excellent. As it is though, and despite really wanting to like this, the flaws are too clear. Final rating - Okay, but could've been much more."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10719958/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," quite a lineup of actors ","Greetings again from the darkness. All it took was one look at the cast for me to agree to watch and review this mob film. It's the first feature film from writer-director Jimmy Giannopoulos, and he co-wrote the screenplay with Diomedes Raul Bermudez and Shiloh Fernandez (who also stars). Most will agree the world never really needs another mob movie, but gosh, when they work, they are quite fun to watch. Filmmakers Guy Ritchie and Martin Scorsese have figured this out.And then there are those that try hard, but for whatever reason, it doesn't quite click. Sometimes too many characters are crammed in to execute (pun intended) as many familiar mob movie tropes as possible. Director Giannopoulos opens his film with a flashback scene from 10 years ago. The rest of the movie takes place in one evening - one that goes better for some than others. Gio (co-writer Shiloh Fernandez) is dressed in his suit as this is the night "the family" celebrates the death of his father 10 years prior. Gio's mother (Lorraine Bracco) has baked the titular cake, as she has done each of the previous years. She tells Gio she does this "for your father." Gio then sets out to walk the streets of Brooklyn in order to bring the cake to his Uncle Angelo's house for the celebration.Gio is good-natured and prefers talking and smiling his way through confrontations, rather than the violent tendencies of those around him. Most of the movie revolves around his interactions along the way - with some friendlies and some not-so-friendlies. It seems his chocolate allergy comes up in conversation enough times that we know it will come into play at some point. If it's not his food allergy, then it's the whereabouts of his Cousin Leo (Emery Cohen) that makes up most of the conversations we hear. Leo is recently out of prison, but hasn't contacted his mother yet ... a real no-no in the family. Leo had previously crossed a Puerto Rican gang and now he's missing - hence all the questions.If you come for the story, you'll likely be disappointed. This is more a series of vignettes featuring familiar faces such as Luis Guzman as a concerned Uber driver, William Fichtner as a man with a violent nature, and John Magaro, Aldis Hodge, Ashley Benson, Vincent Pastore (of course), Penn Badgley, Jeremy Allen White, and even Marla Maples (yes, the former Mrs. Trump). Once at the party, Gio meets with an ailing Uncle Carmine played by Paul Sorvino, and best of all, Uncle Angelo played by Val Kilmer. If you have not heard, Mr. Kilmer had throat cancer and now speaks through a voice box. Subtitles are utilized to assist viewers. Watching him act with his eyes and body language is a pleasure, and it's great to have him back on the big screen. The final big name to appear in the film is Ewan McGregor as Father Kelly, who has an early scene with David Mazouz ("Gotham") as young Gio, and a later scene with modern day Gio and his mother.We follow Gio in his strange, messy night ... think AFTER HOURS (1985) ... only mob-related, and lacking most of the dark comedic touches. Other than Fernandez, most of the actors are only in a scene or two, so there's a novelty effect that doesn't seem quite right for this genre. Paul Sorvino has only a solitary two-word line of dialogue that starts with an F and ends with you. Still a well-executed crescendo of death and getting to see so many familiar faces in one film makes it worth sticking till the end.In theaters and On Demand June 18, 2021."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10719958/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," VIEWS ON FILM review of The Birthday Cake ","2021's The Birthday Cake is my latest write-up. The film's title refers to an actual cake that is taken to a memorial celebration. Said cake is also sort of metaphoric. I mean it's literally like an antagonistic co-star.So OK, The Birthday Cake surprised me considering how much the other critics panned it. My question is how is this flick overlooked? Yeah it's mob-related and well, mob-licious. But it also plays out like a living nightmare, a sort of horror talkie if you will."Cake" stars Shiloh Fernandez and he heads up a well-known cast of at least 5 people who appeared in Goodfellas (I'm not kidding). Fernandez is the anchor here and his screen presence is indeed bruising. It's like 1972's Michael Corleone appeared out of nowhere with well, a little facial hair.Speaking of Goodfellas and Mean Streets and um, Uncut Gems, The Birthday Cake is like a compact version of all three of them. Rookie director Jimmy Giannopoulos (I'll just call him Jimmy G) gets his camera right up in the actor's grills. His pace is frantic and claustrophobic as it feels like everyone is filmed in a freaking tin can.Ewan McGregor, Val Kilmer, Lorraine Bracco, and Luis Guzman are just a handful of co-stars in Jimmy G's cowed, blistering vision. They're mere sycophants in the film's 93-minute running time but you like seeing them on screen anyway. Heck, it's good catching up with Kilmer considering what the dude has gone through. Val plays a mafia boss who I guess got shot in the throat and can't talk properly. In real-life Kilmer suffered through throat cancer and uses a Tracheotomy to get the words out. Man that's some mindful casting.All in all, "Cake's" only criticism from me is that the film is rather short with so many familiar faces fading in and out. I mean Shiloh's Gio is the only one that registers from a full, narrative standpoint. Oh well. Any snapshot of beastly thug life caught on camera is better than no snapshot at all. The Birthday Cake is the type of violent crime drama that gets under your skin and seeps into your bloodstream. For a little over an hour and a half, I had my "cake" and ate it too."

I had a hard time understanding the dialogue so I had to turn on the subtitles.I mainly wanted to leave a review to score it fairly for those with an open mind.

On the other hand, his cousin Leo had everyone in the neighborhood looking for him because he got caught by the feds transporting drugs and world on the streets he was a rat.

I thought we would get it sorted at the end since the Storyline indicated Gio's 'life is changed after witnessing murder, violence' etc and 'the truth about what happened to his father'. I saw the violence but I must be a bit slow because I have no idea what happened to Gio's father or why...or what the truth is.

Had it been full of unknowns then I'm sure would have viewed it less harshly. As it didn't it made things worst. I wanted to think that as it had good cast then would find it enjoyable and the reviews were wrong. I personally found the reviews to be quite true in this instance."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10719958/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," A bit of a letdown but not bad ","I think we expected more. This is the kind of film that follows mob family movies like Godfather and Sopranos -- even some of the same actors -- and a lot less happens than we'd wish, and it's not as clever as it wishes. Excellent quality overall but for me the blandness of the story makes it a waste of a great group of talent."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10719958/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","3"," The godfather on skittles ","Omg why did I waste so much time watching this to the end, it was completely nonsensical from beginning to the end! From the ridiculous script to the awful acting, really just nonsense!"

I watched until 40mins left and still none of the major actors yet to show their faces in this movie,Story buildup far too slow, writing and directing was awful."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10719958/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," Just Dial Back the Tropes for Next Time ","Harsh much? Not the complete waste of time implied by other reviewers. Now, the NYT stugots definitely owed somebody money, or is related to the director, but there's potential here. Scale back the mob movie cliches a bit - getting ingredients for the Don's "gravy", Irish priests, slow motion set to 1950s music, women wearing leopard print - and there's likely a rising talent behind the scenes. Also, even with limited screen time for the heavy-hitters, the cast assembled is a treat for fans of the genre. Flawed, but not without some hope for future projects from Giannopoulos."

This film is stunningly bad. The story is fine, although probably really just enough for a TV movie or a short film. The actors are great. But the direction and final cut are just disgraceful.And the final nail is that they have to have Ewan McGregor do a voice-over to give the film a clear narrative."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10722406/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," Half terror with a wrong speech ","With a naked eye the movie is not bad in comparison to others Mexican movies that they have sold us in recent years, but is not good enough to stand out among it genre.It has a lot of predictable and not to good jumpscares, but despite that, it has some moments of horror. There are times when it gets slow and repetitive, at the beginning I didn't like the performances but as the movie progresses they improve at a certain point.There is a very big problem in terms of social class in this movie, the upper class is represented by people with fair complexions, blond hair and colored eyes, while the working class is represented by people with dark complexions, dark hair, brown eyes, they do not have ambitions, they do not even define their way of being of these characters, which seems to me a stereotype that we must remove from our minds, especially in Mexican society that we judge simply by the appearance of others, I know that you do not want to give a message in a horror movie but for me it is a wrong speech and completely ruins the movie."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10722406/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","1"," The worst horror movie i have ever seen (at least now). ","This movie really is the definition of cliche and cheesy. Every character is so dumb, i cant take anything seriously (although to be honest, this happens in almost every Mexican both movies and series, for a reason i would never understand), and every, and i mean, every situation in this movie is predictable. Theres no horror, just situations that gives you cringe!!!Gabriel in a few scenes was honestly a bit decent, but he also falls down soon."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10724982/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Better than expected! ","Sure it's not a big-budget blockbuster. Nor is it even a low-budget B-movie.

Who was dad, how he died, why he has burned down all of his properties, even why he has donate his only house to the bank while 3 of his chidden were adult and almost fighting to establishing their career, at this movie those questions had no any answer at all.03. The brother who is working on a corporate office (maybe), not goes to his office on whole movie without any acceptable reasons, moreover his job goes totally fine after taking all those unnecessary vacations. Wow that was really un-believable.04. Is that really the way of fund rising, where all 3 clowns are gossiping & saying blah, bah, blah on front of camera at the whole 1 hour 24 minutes movie?05. Well MR. DIRECTOR, i really don't know how many movies you've directed to your lifetime career, the numbers maybe huge. But the point is who was your targeted audience for those movies, what was their class, does they really understand the story of a movie, i really don't know about those questions!

They become neighbors with the boaters who dock in the shadow of their high-rise, looking at them as their neighbors.As they watch the comings and goings of a boater named Charles (Michael Par), they'll soon wish they hadn't seen what looks like him murdering his girlfriend Tess (Krista Grotte Saxon). That's after Charles has gotten into a fight with Peter, framed him for breaking and entering and what could be the absolute worst thing, taken his dog.Sure, it's Rear Window, but Par is as intense as always, and that's the kind of movie I love to watch.Under his other name Alvaro Passeri, Cerchi did the miniatures for Atlantis Interceptors and Fulci's Warriors of the Year 2072, as well as special effects for The Wild Beasts, even serving as the rock sculptor on Caligula, the assistant art director on Tentacles, the assistant production designer for Alien 2: On Earth and the director of Plankton."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10730376/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," VIEWS ON FILM review of The Penthouse ",""What did you actually see?" I saw The Penthouse and you know what, I probably don't plan on seeing it again. At least not through my "rear window". Natch.Anyway, 2021's "Penthouse" is my latest write-up. For once, the title actually fits what's going on in the movie. "Penthouse" is about a platonic married couple who purchase an 11th floor penthouse with great vistas. They also spy on a pseudo neighbor who lives on a boat and might be a cold-blooded killer (come on, you just know he is).The Penthouse is not a violent thriller but a slow-burner and a low budget churner. Not a lot happens at least not what we the audience, can see. Suggesting something Hitchcockian, using flighty camera angles, and feeling like an art house version of a Lifetime pic, "Penthouse" has acting that's mediocre, suspense that's wonted, and direction that's well, standard. Despite all this, the viewer could easily get sucked in waiting for the final outcome (I did cause I'm just easily deceived).So yeah, The Penthouse has an ending that's as laughable, unceremonious, and anti-climatic as I can remember. If the film's director (Massimiliano Cerchi) needed a few more takes to get what he wanted, he probably should have used them. The music pounces in at all the wrong moments, a dog escapes by itself on a boat, and the interplay between the lead characters feels like junior high kids making art with a camcorder.Bottom line: The Penthouse has one decent performance that comes from entitled antagonist Michael Pare (he plays scruffy scammer Charles). And the flick does have a few tense moments where the "violence of the mind" is present and ever thought over. Most of the time though, "Penthouse" is more a cinematic "outhouse" than a luxurious fit. A mixed "view" to a kill."

","No words can describe what a piece of poo this is.This movie is one of the worst directed, worst written, and worst acted thriller I have seen in awhile. Just skip it and find anything else. The ending, if u can even call it that, makes no sense, basically the movie just stops.I just don't get what was the whole point, it just sucks so hard that I can't believe this has been done intentionally - surely something went horribly wrong somewhere, there has to be some excuse for the lack of any intelligence."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10730376/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","1"," Totally bad and failed ","It's rare to see such a bad movie. The storyline looks like a goofy variation of Rear Window, but it turns out to be a true story set in the penthouse and boat of the case. The dialogues, the situations and the actors are also very bad. To this is added an atrocious staging with absurd connections between the shots, a detestable photograph (the point blur for no reason) and the framing which move without reason and sometimes do not even respect the horizontality. To be avoided, without any interest."

","I don't write many reviews but this movie was so bad in so many ways right from the first frame and opening credits that I had to chime in. Immediately the 1st thing you notice is that the footage running under the opening credits looks like washed out stock footage from the 80s. Sadly this isn't the case and whoever was manning the camera had no idea what he/she was doing. In fact, most of the movie looks this way. Soft picture, dull colors and uncontrolled lighting that seems way too harsh most of the time... From scene to scene the overall look is so inconsistent it just kept me from ever actually caring about the storyline. The acting was also entry level amateur, the cinematography boring and the bargain basement cast of washed up has-been D-movie actors just didn't help at all. This kind of movie may be for some but was just a wasted night for me. I'd call it an exercise in mediocrity except that would be an undeserved compliment."
