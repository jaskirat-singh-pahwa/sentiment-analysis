Localised and shot in and around Pittsburgh so as a Romero fan that was a nice treat. Jason Momoa can do this kind of role in his sleep by now so he's as good as you'd expect. The big pharma back story is very timely, but it never really ties up with the BOURNE style hitmen and bodyguards running around all over the place, it doesn't feel too realistic. The writing is kind of sloppy here. As for the big twist at the climax, I didn't mind it all that much personally but I can see how some might. One strong point is the action choreography which is always on point."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10731768/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," Momoa does a Neeson ","Ray Cooper (Jason Momoa) is devastated from his wife's cancer death after greedy Pharma executive Simon Keeley (Justin Bartha) withdraws an experimental life-saving drug. Ray vows revenge on national TV. He is contacted by an investigative reporter. His daughter Rachel (Isabela Merced) follows him to the meeting. The reporter is killed by an assassin. Ray and Rachel are both terribly hurt in the incident.I'm fine with the last act. In fact, that adds a little spice to a generally bland Neeson-like script. I hated the Home Alone feel of the confrontations. If the hitman brings a gun, we bring a knife. If the hitman brings a knife, we bring a lamp. It gets a bit annoying. The ending helps a little with that but it still would be better if he simply turns into a cold-blooded killer. Nevertheless, this feels like a script from the Neeson rejects pile. Momoa will have to do better if he wishes to continue down this road."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10731768/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," It wasn't supposed to end this way ","The film opens with Aquaman talking the Jason Bourne jump off of a building. We then go back in time. Ray Cooper (Jason Momoa) and his daughter Rachel (Isabela Merced) are with their mother when she dies from cancer. The miracle drug that could save her was suddenly pulled from the market by Bioprime who spiked it. Ray meets a reporter who claims he has evidence it was all a scam involving all kinds of people and off shore accounts. After the reporter is stabbed right in front of him, Ray decides he wants answers. This leads to a trail of blood as Ray and his daughter are both fighters and are being hunted.I liked the twist at the end, although I think it might have made a better film without it.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10731768/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Sour Girl too ","But having two flavors mostly is a good thing right? Now the question that remains is: can Jason Mamao carry an action movie? Well actually I reckon we know the answer to that. And while we do .. there might be things here ... we don't know.Let's just say that the movie has a twist waiting for you. Maybe you're able to see it coming, but I have to admit as surprising as I thought it is .... it didn't really make much sense in the overall context. With what we saw and how it played out. I won't say anymore, because this is one of the USP of the movie - the unique selling point of it to be truthful.Because most of the rest is quite ordinary. I don't think the fight scenes will get you too excited (well done, but not amazing in any sense of the word). Having said all that I understand if you feel the movie does not deserve that twist (or any others who are way more on the nose and predictable). It does have a theme that will resonate with many though - or themes. Family and health care. Bernie Sanders may or may not be proud of that (not sure how he feels about violence, but I doubt he condones it, no matter the circumstances)."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10731768/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," The end of the world......is how it felt. ","I've given it a few stars because of the opening few minutes, I initially thought great story, a terrific story to tell, a man taking revenge against a greedy pharmaceutical company, sadly after about fifteen minutes it changes.Fifteen minutes in, you get a typical trashy American shoot'em up, with an average guy taking down four armed men with no weapon on him....that is until he starts running around with an axe.You get the cheesy dialogue throughout, talk of being a family, staying strong etc, it is quite literally vomit inducing.Momoa....in the first fifteen minutes we get to see him actually acting, and he was really good, playing against the stereotypical hunky action beefcake, sadly he falls straight into that after the strong opening.I lost patience with it very quickly, and found that I quite literally couldn't care less about the outcome or direction.I would quite literally call it an hour and fifty minutes of trash TV, if you like trashy, mindless films you may enjoy it, sadly a good story got very lost in this. 4/10."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10731768/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Decent action thriller with a twist ","As this thriller opens we see Ray Cooper being confronted by law enforcement officers on the roof of a Pittsburgh stadium; rather than be arrested he jumps into the river. The action then jumps back several years; Ray and his daughter Rachel are with his wife in hospital. She has cancer but the doctor tells them that a cheap treatment is about to be released... not long after he must tell then that due to a deal with the patent holder the new affordable drug won't be available. As the CEO of the medical company responsible appears on a talk show Ray call in and tells him that if his wife dies he will kill the man. She does die. Sometime later Ray is contacted by a journalist who says he has evidence of illegal activity by the company; Ray goes to meet him, followed by Rachel. At the meeting the journalist is killed and Ray is injured. Ray then sets about getting even with the CEO before fleeing with Rachel; they are pursued by shady characters.This is a solid enough thriller; the sort you enjoy while watching but don't feel the need to watch again. The plot isn't the most original; but that isn't too much of a problem as it serves to get ordinary man Ray to seek revenge before fleeing with daughter Rachel. The action scenes are enjoyable and there is a fun variety of locations. Jason Mamoa and Isabela Merced are solid as Ray and Rachel respectively; there are also decent performances from Manuel Garcia-Rulfo as the hitman they cross paths with and Lex Scott Davis as sympathetic FBI Agent Sarah Meeker. There is a major plot twist, which I won't describe as it would ruin the fun for first time viewers. I didn't see it coming and while it is a bit farfetched it wasn't as ridiculous as things I've seen in other action films. Overall I wouldn't say this was a must watch but it is fun enough if you like action films and don't demand too much realism."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10731768/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," Watchable, but that was about it... ","I sat down to watch the 2021 movie "Sweet Girl" without actually having heard about it prior to getting to watch it. But I figured a movie with Jason Momoa on the cast list couldn't be all bad. So of course I sat down to watch "Sweet Girl".And this 2021 action thriller from writers Gregg Hurwitz and Philip Eisner was adequately entertaining, although somewhat generic. The storyline was fair enough, although the writers were cashing in on just about every trope seen in action thrillers before. However, I will say that there was a twist to the storyline, one that I will not mention here, of course, and I hadn't seen that coming. So whether or not the twist to the story was good or bad is up to personal interpretation of course. Personally, then I wasn't much fan of that twist, though it was unforeseen.There is a good amount of action in "Sweet Girl" and the action sequences are nicely choreographed and executed, and that definitely helps to carry the movie, as the storyline alone was having ups and downs.Now, the movie has Jason Momoa on the cast list, and he does carry the movie well enough. But I have to say that the long hair and beard is growing thin - not physically or literally on him - but in the sense that it is becoming a nuisance to look at. In just about every single movie he looks the same, so it is becoming progressingly more and more difficult to tell his different characters apart from different movies.While I managed to sit through "Sweet Girl" and found it to be adequately entertaining, it just wasn't an outstanding action thriller, and there are far better movies in that genre out there. This was, at best, the type of movie that you sit down to watch once and then never again.My rating of "Sweet Girl" lands on a very bland and generic five out of ten stars."

Why? Why?The only thing I like is the hired killer character, maybe because he doesn't lokk like a killer. I like the scene where he speaks of his childhood and his slaughtered village and family. That's all I like in this lousy and incomprehensible crap."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10731768/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Watchable but that's it. ","Sweet Girl is the kind of action movie where not everything makes sense, where there are a lot of moments you think "Yeah, right...", but in the end it's entertaining enough to keep your attention. I didn't see the twist coming towards the end, so that was a bonus. But do I need to watch it again in the future? Certainly not. For that it's just not good enough, plus I thought the acting of Isabela Merced was sometimes not very convincing. Jason Momoa on the other hand was convincing but it's just not Oscar material. I don't regret watching it though, sometimes I like to watch mindless popcorn movies and Sweet Girl just fits in that category."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10731768/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," Classic revenge flick, with a dumb twist ","Two thirds of the film you are going to ask yourself two questions: 1. Why is the movie called Sweet Girl when it is all about Jason Momoa? And 2. How can that little adolescent turd not be wrecked with guilt for her stupidity and instead is sanctimonious and judgemental with her father and continues to never listen to anything he says? The twist provides the answer to both and it's pretty satisfying, but it works for about a second before you realize that it invalidates most of all the other things that happened until then. Then comes the ending, which is really weak.Maybe if I could have been invested in any of the characters beyond a generic sob story and a generic villain that anyone hates, I would have enjoyed it more. There is no positive to watching the film, the action scenes are generic, the story is generic, the characters are generic. Other than the twist, which feels very 1990s anyway, there is nothing that is not forgettable five minutes after the credits roll."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10731768/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","2"," Stupid Twist Ruins Already Stupid Movie ","I was just going to write about star Jason Momoa's blathering bookending voiceover narration, the repetitive time jumping early on, the formulaic and clich-ridden conspiratorial action-revenge script, how unbelievable it is that a pharmaceuticals CEO would take questions from the public on a TV broadcast, and how the daughter is an annoying and unnecessary tag-along character, but then "Sweet Girl" turns out to be made by wannabe M. Night Shyamalan hacks who add a twist to the otherwise generic variation of "The Fugitive" (1993), and it's a doozy of utter stupidity. It literally adds nothing but a lot of otherwise needless padding to the proceedings to foreshadow it. The movie could've been cut in half without it, and it would've been much better for it. I mean, there'd still be nothing of value here, but it'd be shorter. Really, 110 minutes of this mundane nonsense! What a complete waste of time."

","3 out of 5 stars.Sweet Girl is a fair action thriller film that gives Jason Momoa and Isabela Merced the action spotlight. It is a decent action thriller that is entertaining. It is nothing more besides filled with its action clichs, decent pharmaceutical greedy corporations plot, and okay action sequences.What Worked? Jason Momoa and Isabela Merced did great with there roles. Playing father and daughter after losing there mother Amanda (Adria Arjona). And there was a treatment for her illness. But corporate greed took the treatment off the market for there personal profit. Ray (Jason Momoa) and Rachel (Isabela Merced) both follow up with the investigation. And come across hired hitman who are trying to cover up any investigations. Jason Momoa and Isabela Merced taking the action spotlight is exciting. And has a lot of potential.It has its decent action sequences. Nothing more special than a one time watch and getting entertained by it. The direction is okay but forgettable.There is a twist that turns it into an interesting exciting direction which was cool to see the third act playing out.What did not work?The plot is like a revenge story. Add a bit of pharmaceutical conspiracy and corrupt corporate greed. Which adds nothing special to the story. Then, having assassins chasing Jason Momoa and Isabela Merced throughout. FBI agents on there trails and steps behind them.It is a typical clich action thriller where the assassin and FBI are always a step behind the two main characters. No matter how good they cover there tracks.Sweet Girl is an okay action thriller that shines the spotlight on the two leads but forgettable story and direction that does not add anything new to the genre."

"," Sadly, it was underwhelming ","It had some good action scenes, but the story felt too bland and dragged out. Momoa and Merced had great chemistry as dad and daughter, but her as an action character taking out big guys was laughable. The twist was decent, but took too long to get there, and I think wasn't really needed as a trade off to see Momoa keep kicking @ss. The 109 mins felt much long with too much filler and not enough substance, as well as some slow and dragged out scenes. Still, a decent watch if you're a Momoa fan."

I blame it on the films of George Romeo but who knows? The terrific location photography is the only part of "Sweet Girl" that's worth watching.

Will Ray and his daughter Rachel(Moner) fight justice?Overall I thought I wasn't that bad at all but the premise reminds me of a film that Keanu Reeves would star in(I think it's either John Wick or maybe it was an Arnold Schwarzenegger film I dunno) but again it's a film that Keanu would star in.There is a twist in this film that I didn't see coming involving Ray or even Rachel."

I liked the look of the film, the attention to detail with period costumes and settings, and the ending was solid too.And it goes without saying but the dishes really did look super yummy and it made me incredibly hungry, so definitely try to have a meal either beforehand or during if you plan to watch this lol."

It starts out quite slowly, like a family drama or prime-time soap, with a lot of bickering and bad behaviour and tension over the canapes, but as it progresses, strange things start happening and everyone finds they face a reckoning for not respecting the land along with the myths and magic embodied there. It all builds up to a bloody, violent, batshit crazy climax and a somewhat heavy-handed eco revenge message, getting weirder, more stylised and quite gory, but...well, I liked it.

Nay, "The Pond" transcends the bonds of what is considered average entertainment, and it brings something cosmic and something that borders on madness to the game. For better or worse. Now, some may enjoy this, like I did, while others will take aversion to this particular movie.The storyline is nicely constructed, though it can hardly be said that it is a fast paced movie or a particularly eventful movie. So if you are looking for such things, then you will be bored mindless with "The Pond", I guarantee it. "The Pond" is a very slow paced movie and little happens, but the story is nicely written by Dusan Bulic and gradually piles on more and more strange events, slight madness and just general bizarre weirdness.The acting in the movie was good. And I wasn't familiar with a single actor or actress in the movie, not that the movie was abundant with performers, mind you. But I enjoy watching movies with new and unfamiliar faces, as I am not associating them with previously portrayed characters in other movies.While the storyline is slow and rather uneventful, the movie is just permeated so well by a very malignant atmosphere, one that slowly sinks in and festers. And the music score for the movie really helps to paint a bleak picture and helps the descend into madness greatly along. And there is a sense of isolation and helplessness to the movie, that definitely also worked well in favor of the overall feel of the movie."The Pond" is a movie of a very acquired taste, and I doubt that it is a movie that will do overly well with the average viewer.Despite having lots of things working for it, I have to admit that the movie just lacked that particular ingredient to make it pop and stand out. Ultimately, "The Pond" is a mundane movie that attempts to achieve much more than director Petar Pasic could deliver. It was a shame really, because this movie could have been magnificent.My rating of "The Pond" settles on a mediocre five out of ten stars. I liked the movie, but it just didn't stand out. And while the movie is atmospheric and have some interesting aspects to it, it just didn't bring enough contents to the table. And this is, without a doubt, not a movie that you will watch more than once - provided you manage to endure through the slow paced storyline the first time."

But in the end, it comes off as pretentious and not as elegant as it might hope to be.Sure, some scenes manage to pull you out of the boredom, even get you invested in the movie, but it is not something that one would easily appreciate, just look at the comments, the reviews online, people called it too much style over substance because it is, tried to be too smart for its own good and managed to get itself stuck in a bad place. Also, this is a psychological movie, not a horror, it doesn't explore the murder section at all, but believe me, it is a good thing, a better thing, yet it still doesn't manage to bring any kind of satisfaction. If you were to compare it to a sugar rush, just imagine having no sugar, nor rush. Just a viewer, hoping for some crumbs to be thrown to him, but never getting any.Cheers!"

Also, you need to give enough interesting character dialogue and show progression not to lose your viewer. Following general horror cliches with creepy kids, occult imagery, scary faces, and frightening toilet doors are not enough.The Pond contains a very hazy and muffled general idea about hell, God, religion, and humanity. This is not, however, well communicated in the film besides some random disconnected pseudophilosophical dialogue delivered through acting so stiff its density cannot be penetrated by any known material in the world.So, if you are not willing to bleed your brain you will most likely just feel extremely bored and confused throughout the film. Most viewers will catch the obvious symbolism (and homages to the classic films and literature) like the seven deadly sins projected through the characters, seven days of creation, and the circles, oh man, the circles. But these details serve no real purpose but to make the last 5 minutes of the film almost understandable.Confused viewers might think this movie is too deep and smart for them just because it makes no sense - but it's not.They should've just stuck to something understandable and time-tested. Want to show a visual representation of hell - borrow more from Jacob's Ladder, 1408, whatever. Want to tell a creepy occult story with interesting ideas buffed with existential crisis? Copy True Detective Season 1. Oh, wait, they have already done that. Want to explore religion? Make a dialogue-based film like The Man From Earth in the cool location you have, why not.Just not everything at once.I can't recommend this. 3/10, 1 star for the looks and visuals, 1 for the soundtrack (which felt confused about what it was trying to follow), 1 for Paul Leonard Murray's acting."

The story is mildly interesting, but by the end i didn't really care. Again the imagery is really nice.

It is shot well, but the acting is subpar, the characters are not properly explained, the dialogue is clunky, and it uses an audio overlay instead of live audio...so you see their lips moving but it's clear you're hearing something different.The plot is some guy testing a water source and interacting with hallucinations that aren't hallucinations? It's not explained. It's just people walking around with paper bags on their heads and the main character losing his mind but nothing is explained at all. They attempt an explanation between the main character and his University lead and it is just word salad with a doom dressing.It's just not a good story line ultimately, and that's it's entire issue. It had the budget and film crew to do something really creative, the story could have been really interesting, but the director chose to be vague when it came to the plot so you simply don't care what happens by the end because you're so bored or confused."

I totally agree with the other reviewer, I SHOULD have fast forwarded through it, instead of hoping there was a big creepy life changing SCARE coming. At least SHOW the splatter of the guy who jumped. Change the face of the chess opponent creepy writhing "Devils Advocate" style. It was all... So, mismanaged. Mishandled with wasted opportunities left and wrong. I hope someone takes this movie, and edits it, properly, with subtle creepy CGI. That would make ALL the difference. There were NO staring fire eyes, no "torture", no spooky music swells, no nothing. Just a guy doing silly research, and the movie director TRYING to make something out of that, but failing miserably. Small pointless circles, in a pond?!? The people who were really in "hell"... where the poor idiots (me included) who WATCHED this film to the end... hoping to be scared and scarred for life by an extremely scary END scene. Something! Anything! Nope. What a waste. Sadly. Someone please take this and make it spooky. It has elements that could be made spooky. Girl walking in a leafless tree avenue. She mentioned a nightmare creature, but that is never really shared with the viewer... and its NOT "what you don't see is even more powerful". At least you have to hear it, then, or something.

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10739160/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," Brilliant, hypnotic combination of folk horror and cosmic horror told from a Serbian perspective, but it's not for everyone ","I decided to write this to explain what what went on in the film. There will be spoilers. In the film, our main character, the professor, is researching... something. The hypothesis behind this research was so bizarre that the university he worked for forced him into sabbatical to cope with the mental illness that produced his ideas. We learn early on that instead of resting the professor travels daily to an island in the middle of a nearby pond to continue his work in isolation, much to the chagrin of his concerned colleague whom he still communicates with via video calls. The island is inhabited by several odd characters: the boatman who is always falling asleep, the chess player who is constantly eating cookies, the maintenance man who exists in a constant state of near rage, and two very bratty children who appear to be sisters. The only other characters in the film are the professor's colleague, his girlfriend and his daughter. After a rather intense conversation with his colleague we learn the professor began his work after the death of his wife. The closer he gets to proving his hypothesis he becomes increasingly paranoid, reality distorts, people around him start to behave oddly and things generally get (more) weird and surreal (Spoilers from here on out) as character motivations begin to either change or become clear. His girlfriend, who is a former student, is revealed to be working with the professor's colleague in an attempt to either prevent or steal the professor's research. At the close of the 2nd act we learn that the professor's hypothesis is that the world is actually Hell, and he has proven it with his research. His ultimate goal is humanity's escape from Hell which, upon changing our ways after learning we are indeed in Hell, can actually be accomplished. He explains this in a conversation with his colleague and sends his research to him via video call. The colleague receives the data only to launch into a monologue about how this should have been his discovery. He then reveals that he knows the professor is right because of a dream he had and, in one of the film's most chilling scenes, recites a song he heard in the dream while he calmly puts on his coat and hat, opens a window, and jumps to his death while the professor looks on in helpless horror. Once he composes himself, the professor has a revelation. His girlfriend, his colleague, and the inhabitants of the island are the seven princes of hell, all represented by the animal that coincides with the sins they lord over, and all are trying to prevent his discovery. His girlfriend is represented by the goat = lust. His colleague is represented by the snake = envy. One of the little girls is represented by the peacock = pride. The other by the frog = greed. The chess player, the boar = gluttony. The boatman, the turtle = sloth. And the maintenance man, the cat = wrath. Finally, the man wearing a mask of branches is the King of Hell. The professor now knows his daughter is in mortal danger, so he gives her his research, puts her in the boat and sends her away, while the princes of hell wait for him on shore. As she drifts off the King of Hell rises from the underworld while the professor appears imprisoned in what looks to be an insane asylum having a conversation with the chess player. The chess player explains that the King of Hell has chosen the professor's daughter as his next human host, which was the goal all along. As he does the film cuts to the King of Hell approaching the professor's daughter, who tosses the research aside, puts on a mask, and walks away with the King. The chess player tells the professor "You lost this one friend. Checkmate. Or should I say: 'the king is dead. Long live the king'." The last thing we see is the professor's daughter sitting on a pile of thatch like a throne. The world will stay in Hell. The singing of the song is heard as the credits roll: Do not wake him up he is dreaming. If he opens his eyes he will not see us anymore. If he wakes up we will cease to exist. If we stop praying to him he will have nightmares. If it may be so our world will stay in Hell. So keep quiet, he is asleep. Lets sing in silence while he dreams. He dreams of the world while the world dreams of him. In the silence of a noise, in the darkness of the light. Eternal in the end."

It doesn't roar loudly but fair enough for a little soul. ","Sherni (2021) : Brief Review -Sherni is a different attempt to discover political drama that comes with a highly important topic like "Save Animals". But unfortunately it's an unimportant topic for us civilians. We urban cities folks are completely unware of this Tiger hunting thing. We just watch or read it somewhere in news and forget it. But for the people who actually experience this attack can't forget it that easily. It affects their livelihood and many even lose their lives and then there are political gamers who use this thing for their own benefit. Amit Masurkar has tried to break the silence on this issue in Sherni but somewhere he fails to bring the realistic aggression and brutalism into it. Rather, he makes it character friendly and more lively for common viewers.Sherni is a story of a honest Forest officer Vidya, who is transferred to a remote village. She strives for balance in a world of man-animal conflict while she also seeks her true calling in a hostile environment. The basic idea here was to tell people how these politicians take advantage of anything and how our once beautifully balanced universe is losing the balance because of them. It's a very big thought actually but sadly it comes with cliches and unaggressive nature. The screenplay is fine by the way, there isn't anything too dull or bad about it. Enough amount of thrill, humour, fun and regional touch and it all goes smoothly.Acting wise, Vidya Balan is good but not great. One who has seen her since her debut knows that she is an actress with high Calibre and desnrvee high range roles. Sherni doesn't bring best out of her, rather it limits her skills somehow. Vijay Raaj and Brijendra Kala are fantastic in their roles as that typical humour works correctly for them. Rest of the supporting cast is decent. Sherni is shot beautifully by Rakesh Haridas, especially all the forest scenes and those top views in pan mode. Dialogues are bearable, nothing to notice. Music is strictly average and situational and there was no scope for it anyways. Well, the background score had a scope but wasted. Actually, Sherni is almost like a songless film and it still has 130 minutes runtime that surely looks longer than needed. Some more trimming, and it would have been a tight film.Amit Masurkar can't be blamed for everything because he has tried his best to make a small story look big and important. Sometimes it's all about the limits of narrow minded writing and then even a good director can't do much. Still, Amit has stretched it as long as he could and has made it a watchable affair. Sherni lacks those basic vocal chords needed for the loud Roar yet it still roars on its own level. Overall, Good but we expected better from Amit and Vidya.RATING - 6/10*"

As the villagers faces the challenge to let their cattle graze, the government call out for a sharp-shooter to hunt the tigress down, a decision not welcomed by many animal conservationist. Enter the forest officer, Vidya Vincent, played by Vidya Balan, who must strike a balance between both the parties and find a solution to reduce the man-animal conflict and save the tigress.From the director of critically acclaimed and National award winning film, Newton, and the Indie-comedy, Sulemaani Keeda, Amit Masurkar, Sherni lets you delve into the life of a forest officer with the true stories of the various unfortunate incidents of wildlife succumbed to the greediness of human beings either through illegal mining, deforestation or poaching which is very much existing in India. Hats off to him for creating niche drama with well-written screenplay that will keep glued on to the screen till the end. Amit Masurkar has taken a bold step to explore the man-animal conflict issues in extremely rural and sensitive part of forest areas of India. The film ignites the fact about the villagers who are unaware of the balance required between the man and animal to maintain peace and harmony for either side to exist. The film also showcases the apathy of bureaucrats, politicians and the hunger to get the limelight and stay in a comfortable position. The script is pretty good while editing tends to gets slower though it will never bore you out. Dialogues are nice filled with humor. Background score gels well with the mood of the film. Art direction is amazing while Cinematography is splendid, capturing the exotic forest locations of India. The film boast of some mind-blowing performances. Vidya Balan hits the bull's eye with her sparkling performance. The actor steals the thunder with her dynamic acting as she gets into the character of a forest officer with ease. Vijay Raaz will surprise you with admiring performance. Brijendra Kala is marvelous while Sharat Saxena impresses with his cunning yet powerful role. Mukul Chaddha, Neeraj Kabi, Ila Arun and Gopal Dutt are wasted in a miniscule role.Sherni is the perfect answer to the changing trend of Indian Cinema. Until the death of Avni tigress, the man-animal conflict subject was never taken seriously. Probably her sacrifice raises the question on the implementation of Indian wildlife law, decommissioning of lethargic Indian judiciary and weak bureaucracy. This one brings out the spark required - Brilliant 3.5/5Produced by T-Series & Abundantia Entertainment, Sherni is currently streaming on Amazon Prime Video from 18th June 2021."

The jungle's, the farms, the plantation environment, the animals, the dry water holder, the thin river, etc. Stand worth a watch. The only thing that made me chuckle were the tiger paws, I mean so clear (appear obviously constructed), but then I might be a noob.Direction: Above average. The story is not that complicated or politics ridden. It has been nicely directed with all its elements. By not that complicated I mean you can understand it by skipping half of the content. I would not recommend that but it's what so is.Acting (& music): Average. The casting done is what is to be appreciated like most of the movies, TV series released in recent times.Final Verdict: You should definitely give the movie a try if you have free time.

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10741542/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," Competent performances. Boring film. ","Sherni review :In the prime of her career, the late Sridevi had played the titular role of Sherni (1988) - a film which got a bumper opening at the box office reaffirming her superstar status. Sridevi was like a tigress on screen. You would expect the same from Vidya Balan, playing a forest officer in Amit Masurkar's namesake film. Alas, Vidya is absolutely thandaa..She's not the one to blame. The movie is. A complete bore from start to finish; Sherni revolves around a forest in Madhya Pradesh where a ferocious tigress has turned maneater. The forest officials including Vidya, are on their job when the local politicians decide to use this "issue" for their own agenda. A ruthless hunter (Sharad Saxena) and a conniving officer (Neeraj Kabi) are handed over the case.The film's biggest flaw is its utter predictability. There is no thrill or excitement though this is supposedly a tiger hunt movie. Masurkar takes on too many issues - enviroment vs development, gender equality, patriarchy, government apathy, office politics, red tapism etc etc but isn't able to do justice to any. A case of biting more than one can chew!!!Of the cast, Vidya Balan expectedly stands out with a restrained and assured act. Sharad Saxena is simply superb in the negative role. Neeraj Kabi, Brijendra Kala, Vijay Raaz and others lend good support.Despite such competent performances, Sherni fails to satisfy fully. It basically lacks what Vidya Balan, herself advocated in one of her biggest hits - Entertainment Entertainment and Entertainment!!!Regards, Sumeet Nadkarni."

Sherni has almost everything but lacks what a good film must have - moments of "cinematic" brilliance where you feel emotionally moved & stirred but cannot explain why. That's the beauty of any good art work. Newton did that so well but not this one.Extremely detailed, well acted, realistic camera movements - all were there but the poetry and poignancy was missing which made this film maybe a good documentation of our forest , wildlife, people , government procedures etc but failed to make it a good "CINEMA"."

","'From the Director of Newton,' those words alone heightened up its prospects from the very get-go! Amit Masurkar knows how to make a Satire work. He could tidily compile matters of social importance with a subdued taste of dark humor. An atypical yet efficient way of Storytelling whereupon he predominantly excels!Out this time he addresses a 'Tiger Hunt' deep in the Jungle! In the meantime foreshadowing Systematic Depravity, Pervasive Despotism & the ulterior agendas of soi-disant politicos! In conjunction with few precarious concerns regarding Wildlife conservation, imminent threat of Poachers, Huntsmen; who would stop at nothing to register a shameless 'kill' in their books!Visually, this was a sight to behold! With compelling pieces of imagery going deep through vast foliages of the forest, a sense of serenity and quietude gently overwhelms your conscience. And a pertinent Score significantly contributes to the same cause!Having Vidya Balan as an active member of the cast, one can be certain of her complete devotion to whichever role she's playing. One of the few actresses in Bollywood who stands apart from the rest, owing to her sheer class and maturity as an out-and-out performer! Even amongst such a talented bunch of artists like Vijay Raaz, Brijendra Kala, Sharat Saxena; it comes as no surprise that She stole the limelight once again!Unfortunately in its entirety, there were some caveats too. To start with, the first thing that springs to mind is its prolonged Screenplay and moreover, the stagnant pace that can be wearisome at times! Despite the actors providing us with competent enactments; the characterization on them left much to be desired.Ultimately it's one of those thought-provoking pieces of art that not only dare to speak against inhumane practices done on animals but also throw light upon the valiant men & women in our Forest Departments who have their lives on the line pretty much all the time. It's high time we acknowledge the value of the contributions they make for the betterment of our society and Mankind in general!"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10741542/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," A worthy follow-up to Newton ","Amit Masurkar is a director to watch out for. It took me some time but in the end I really appreciated Newton. It's been four years and now he's given us Sherni, one of the best Hindi to come out in recent memory.Sherni follows Vidya Vincent, a forest officer who strives for balance in a man-animal conflict whilst seeking for her true calling in a hostile environment.Topics like this aren't regularly shown in Hindi cinema so not only is it refreshing to see a Hindi film have an original and different story see the light of day but it's also informative as to the issues regarding conservation and environmentalism found in India. Masurkar takes us into the world of Sherni and gives us perspectives into every single character's lives whether it's the wildlife officers, villagers, politicians or superior officers. Masurkar crafts this film in a similar way to Newton. It's shot in a documentary-esque style which helps ground the film in reality. The conversations we hear these people have reveal many qualities about them whilst infusing subtle comedy within them. This is mainly shown through Vidya Vincent's perspective as she struggles to deal with the bureaucracy involved whilst striving to keep the environment and wildlife safe, the manipulation created by politicians for their own benefit and the casual sexism she faces being a woman. Masurkar conveys these matters very well without being heavy handed. He injects enough subtlety and lets the drama speak for itself making Sherni an impactful and thought-provoking watch.The performances are all fantastic. I've been noticing a pattern in Vidya Balan's filmography as she's seen playing the same bubbly character in her recent films: Shakuntala Devi, Tumhari Sulu and Mission Mangal. However, I'm amazed by her work in Sherni. Her performance is very subtle and stoic but I'm still able to understand the feelings she's going through. Vijay Raaz is amazing as usual. Brijendra Kala and Sharat Saxena were easily one of the best parts of the films. Saxena does a terrific job playing a self-important person who wants to have his own way whilst Kala is equally excellent as the superior who avoids his work and duty. Ila Arun, Suma Mukundan and Mukul Chaddha all do a great job as Vidya's family that don't understand her field of work. The rest of the cast put forth great performances and add to the realism of Sherni's world.Aside from its length, some pacing issues and some unpolished CGI, Sherni is one of the better Hindi films to come out in recent memory. It brings out many issues that can be talked about after it ends and is a great follow-up to Newton. I'm very impressed by Amit Masurkar as a writer/director and I hope he continues making thought-provoking films like this in the future."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10741542/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","1"," 2 Hours of Preachy Torture ","The film is trying more to teach us some silly if not simple things than how the screenplay needs to be written for a feature length film. There isn't any part of the film that isn't bland from the beginning. It feels like all the characters are acting because there is nothing else to do. None of them are exciting characters and their on screen presence makes me yawn. There is no actual increase in conflict in the story. The writers seem to feel there is but there isn't any. The conclusion to the film too is pathetic. It's true but then I would watch news for that..I can't digest the bland tone of Vidya's character. She is a Malayalee in most films now. What are they trying to do? Butter up the South Indians? It won't work. And if her mom starts to speak in Malayalam why switch to Hindi after some time. Her dialogues starts in Malayalam for just a scene or two. Come on, change the character's state at least. Ila Arun is the same in every film. She is herself and not in any character. Very uninteresting. Vijay Raaz is just OK. If Vijay's character itself is uninteresting, one can imagine everyone else's.The only thing I did appreciate is the night scenes were actual night scenes and not some added DN filters.If I wanted to watch documentaries, there are many on Prime itself and they are wonderful. This film doesn't find the difference between film making and documentary making.Skip it.Watch The Ghost and The Darkness instead, you won't regret it."

Amidst nature and forest politics, Vidya Balan completely reinvents herself.Sherni is a story of a village terrified with tigers and the on going forest politics. Vidya Balan plays Vidya Vincent, a well-intentioned forest inspector, who is at the centre of the plot. We witness everything that happens in the movie through her eyes.Vidya is set off to a fast start, as a man is reported to have been murdered by a tiger as soon as she arrives on the job. The tension in the area rises as more people are killed. The local political bigwig assures them that the tiger will be killed, and soon the politics heats up. Vidya takes the help of DNA expert Noorani (Vijay Raaz) who is a professor and is willing to help identify the deadly beast. But there's a whole lot of politics going on.Amit Masurkar's treatment of the film is fresh and authentic. He also tries to address several social and political aspect of jungle, tribal area and animal politics.Masurkar's characters in the film be it Vidya, Noornai, Bansilal seems pretty convincing. It's as if you are in the center of all the politics and hunt going on.Vidya Balan does not looks like the big star and is completely convincing as forest officer Vidya Vincent. Vijay Raaz is equally convincing as Noorani.Sherni is not your usual masala flick, but a serious movie that delivers a strong message. The film is slow but it's gripping."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10741542/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," Refreshingly different and yet struggles to make a point ","Sherni, directed by Amit Masurkar is indeed a refreshingly different film with a powerful cast. It's based on the fine ecological balance between the wildlife and civilization, forest reserves and human settlements, responsibilities and aspirations, and finally, between the good and indifferent. Vidya Vincent (Vidya Balan) plays a Divisional Forest Officer who has recently taken charge of a wildlife, especially tiger conservation reserve. She is frustrated at not being able to achieve her dreams and quite disillusioned with her government job that she is forced to keep as her husband is passing through a lean phase in his career. She soon realizes that her job isn't easy - a man eating tigress T12 is on the prowl, killing village folks who take their cattle for grazing and a supervisor Bansal (Brijendra Kala) who seems more interested to please the incumbent legislator for his political aspirations and pay absolutely no heed to his official role. The people of the adjoining villages are absolutely miffed at the tigress' not so subtle overtures as she kills every few days, and the forest department doesn't seem to be doing enough to control her. Simultaneously, they are being provoked by an ex-legislator who has an axe to grind against the existing one.Vidya has to battle many adversities to ensure that the tigress that seems to have forayed into human habitation is captured and released back into the reserve onnthe face of absolute defiance of the village folk who are baying for her blood.Sherni is an interesting premise with a refreshingly new plot and an absolutely stunning backdrop of a lush green forest reserve. It boasts of a realistic, practical and polished performance by Vidya Balan, and a remarkable cameo by Vijay Raaz. Brijendra Kala also shines in his character, but Neeraj Kabi, Sharat Saxena, Ila Arun and Mukul Chaddha are grossly wasted. The red tapism, government indifference and compromises are well demonstrated too. So what ails Sherni? The film virtually crawls at an ant's pace and adopts a strange documentary type narrative, sans any drama. It goes on in a monotone without being able to elicit excitement of any kind that leads to loss of interest in the proceedings, although we keep waiting for the tigress' fate. Well, if Amit Masurkar intended to name the film after Vidya Balan's character, it isn't a proper representation really."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10741542/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Phew, Life of a District forest officer !! ","Thanks to Vidhya Balan's talent in picking the right scripts since the beginning of the last decade, we as audience get to see some good movies from her, almost every year. Sherni is another classic example of Vidhya Balan's selection this time teaming up with Director Amit Masurkar. The movie deals with the prolonging man animal conflict along with all the dirty politics involved by it. The movie highlights some valiant efforts done by the forest department on the conservation part.On the flip side red tape, lethargy and high handedness involving bureaucrats and politicians of various shades and stature, without understanding the ground realities are also projected in a very realistic manner.Screenplay focuses a lot on the inner workings of the forest department that takes place after a fatal conflict, though it not very much in detail, it is clever enough to make the point well. Cinematography is crisp and neat, especially the wide angled jungle shots. Production design, costumes, makeup and music were decent. A 130 minute runtime would have definitely kept the editor busy. CGI has come a long way on Indian cinema and Sherni is a good example. On the acting front, Vidhya Balan is in her elements in her portrayal of Vidhya Vincent, the DFO. She is ably supported by some fine performances by Bijendra Kala, Sharat Saxena and Vijay Raaz. Neeraj Kabi & Mukul Chadda don't have much to do.Overall, Thought Sherni is about the life of a DFO who wants to make a difference, as she is constantly at odds with entrenched patriarchy, Which in fact parallels the plight of the helpless tigers, that are out of their natural habitat due to continuing deforestation and dried-up watering holes. The many strands of Sherni make it the film it is. It touches upon the lopsided nature of development, the rights of forest dwellers, the dangers of a depleting forest cover, and the lust of politicians for power and pelf even as the world around threatens to come unstuck.Completely watchable along with family, but I am not sure if the movie would suit mainstream cinema audiences. 7.1 stars out of 10 for giving out a refresher course on the importance of nature conservation and crash course on playing easy dirty politics."

Sherni is not exceptional.It's one of the most REALISTIC films I've ever seen. It's about tracking a tigress, so it's an adventure film. But if you see through the layer then you'll understand it's a SATIRE.Vidya Balan with a brilliant ensemble cast is undoubtedly outstanding. Even they who portrayed villagers and junior officers were completely natural.One song is there called 'Bandarbat ka khela', it also showed us what's going on in the name of 'Samaj Seba' by some leaders. So, the writing material is too strong in this film. Besides, Cinematography and the locations are visually beautiful.Lastly it's a MUST WATCH.Available on Amazon Prime Video. MandalBros."

","Director Amit Masurkar makes a grand return after Newton (2017), delivering a compelling, thought-provoking drama set in a jungle with 'Sherni'.The story follows a steadfast forest officer, played by the ever-dependable Vidya Balan and her journey to track down a man-eating tigress.The film is technically brilliant and Masurkar has injected more tension and suspense, clearly learning from the laggard sections of Newton that made it a tedious viewing experience.He has clearly matured as a director, delivering his messages and politics in a more engaging and entertaining manner with Sherni.Through finely crafted sequences, he highlights the selfish motives of politicians and bureaucrats that upset the delicate ecological balance within forest-adjacent communities.Vidya Balan is electric as the ever-indignant lady officer, forced to endure the taunts and jibes of a casually sexist family and surrounding society. She conveys so much with her body language, elevating the performance to another level entirely.Vijay Raaz, Sampa Mandal and Brijendra Kala are superb in their supporting roles and it was refreshing to see Sharat Saxena in a well-written, fully fleshed out role for a change.Ultimately, Sherni is a lens turned on all of us. At the end of the day, who is the actual uncivilised beast-the morally corrupt humans or the tigress who is just fighting for survival?A must-watch. Recommended!"

"," Sherni, On Prime Video, Is A Story About A Man-Eating Tiger, Where The Villains Are People ","A few years ago, in an interview, director Anubhav Sinha explained to me the concept of cheese in a movie. He said: In those stories that can alternatively be made as films that will be very dry, I put some cheese in. Cheese is the shot of Ayushmann Khurrana heroically carrying the rescued girl in his arms in Article 15 or Ashutosh Rana's thunderous dialogue-baazi in Mulk. I interpret 'cheese' as the delicate sprinkling of something extra to give a movie its throbbing pulse. And I wish Sherni had more cheese in it.Sherni is director Amit Masurkar's follow up to his brilliant Newton. Newton was set in the forests of Chhattisgarh. Sherni is set in the jungles of Madhya Pradesh. Like in Newton, here also, the protagonist Vidya Vincent is a government officer, trying to do the right thing in a rotten system. Early in that film, Newton tells his superior: I want to make a difference, sir. He has, what his instructor so memorably describes as, 'imaandari pe ghamand.' But Newton is a newbie. After nine years of service, Vidya has lost that flush of idealism. She is an efficient and reserved forest officer who holds her own in a boys' club. For entertainment, her superiors - all men - get drunk around a bonfire and sing Bollywood item numbers. She eats dinner alone, with a mewling kitten for company."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10741542/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Well made and realistic film ","I watched Sherni on Amazon Primevideo in orig. Hindi w/Eng. Subs.For those who remember the controversial news reports of Avni the so-called man eating female tiger who was shot dead in 2018, Sherni will immediately ring many bells.This movie has a slow paced, almost documentary style of narration. Viewers expecting an action packed thriller and tigers running all over the film, will be disappointed.The stunning forest locations are apparently in the forests of Balaghat, Madhya Pradesh. Vidya (Vidya Balan) is a newly appointed DFO in a tiger rich block. She is inexperienced but very conscientious and does not mind learning from the field staff. Farms , villages and even a copper mine interrupt the wildlife corridor and villagers routinely take their livestock to graze in the forest, sometimes with expected consequences.A female tiger T2 is 'accused' of killing some villagers. The forest department is pressed to capture the "man eater" and pack her off to some zoo :-((( Noorani (Vijay Raaz) a local zoology professor comes in to collect DNA samples of the accused tiger. Noorani is involved in educating the villagers on how to deal with living with wildlife, and has formed an enthusiastic band of wildlife helpers amongst his students.Pintu (Sharat Saxena), a well connected hunter from Rajasthan promptly arrives on the scene intending to shoot T2 and her 2 hapless little cubs. An election is due and the rival politicians enter the Save The Voters From The Tiger fray, adding fuel to the brimming fire.The forest department's search for the tiger, laying of camera traps, cages and other procedures in such situations are well portrayed. The field staff on the ground are shown as dedicated, knowledgable and enthusiastic. Their boss (Brijendra Kala) however, is politically correct and is happy to play the game. The contractor for the forest dept. Is the local MLA's relative and the standard of the contractors work is well ......As everything heats up, a top politician steps in and orders the forest department to allow Pintu to kill the tiger and her cubs. Vidya desperately approaches her senior Nangia (Niraj Kabi) to save the tigers and is deeply disappointed when he reprimands her telling her to learn "which battles to pick". Noorani who is her big support is also shortly taking a transfer to better pastures in the big city of Mumbai.Nangia promptly orders Vidya's transfer and the last frames show her overseeing the many taxidermy exhibits of presumably the Chhatrapati Shivaji (formerly Prince of Wales) Museum in Mumbai.No further spoilers, suffice it to say it is fairly close to the unfortunate fate that prevailed upon the hapless Avni. The cubs however escape Pintu. A forest employee has sighted them and brings food to them. In reality Siddam Pramila Istari the employee, was rewarded for her considerable efforts by the National Tiger Conservation Authority. Unfortunately Sherni the film barely gives a glimpse of this noble lady's efforts.As I said this film is slow paced, documentary in style, and may not appeal to all. It is realistic with beautiful shots of the dense green forest as it is normally visible to the human eye .. i.e. Without a plethora of wild animals prancing all over the place!All the actors do full justice to their respective characters. The locations are superb.Sherni is a well made film. Very matter of fact. Very sad."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10741542/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," Solid, Crisp and Vidya Balan's Brilliance Makes 'Sherni' a Must-Watch. ","Sherni is about an actual tigress who has gone rogue wreaking havoc, killing cattle and villagers and basically giving a tough time to the forest department officials. There are lots of themes that emerge, so much that the makers want to show and nudge us ever so slightly to ponder about them without overwhelming us. Much like the wild Sherni, Vidya Vincent (Vidya Balan), a newly appointed DFO seems displaced and uprooted from her own natural habitat as she tries settling into her new job. Vincent just wants to do her job and do it well. Nothing out of the ordinary and yet it's her steadfast commitment to her work that makes her remarkable.Director Amit Masurkar weaves an intricate and complex narrative with a rich visual texture, as he dives deep into this man versus animal conflict. The screenplay (Aastha Tiku) is meticulously detailed, giving an insight into not just the protagonist's mind but also the workings of the department and also how the village and the forest are entwined in their existence. The camera (Rakesh Haridas, cinematography) and sound design (Anish John) literally romance the dense, green jungles - dappled sunshine, gurgling streams, buzzing of insects, rustling of leaves, distinct sounds of birds and animals - it all comes to life in 'Sherni'. One simply can't walk away without falling in love with the forests first."Sher hain to jungle hai, jungle hain to baarish hain, baarish hain to paani hain aur paani hai toh hum hain.", these words by a 'Forest Friend', trained by Hassan Noorani assures Vidya that all is not lost in the middle of an intense search for the tigress, which is literally a race against time and adversaries.Vidya Balan gives us a remarkable, understated yet powerful performance, as she exudes the quiet determination, passion and grit of her character. Devoid of any dramatic overtones but with eyes that spark anger and speak volumes, it is a joy to watch Vidya subtly battle sexism and bias not just at work, but also at times at home. Vijay Raaz, Brijendra Kala, Neeraj Kabi, Sampa Mandal, Sharat Saxena add with their effortless performances. Satyakam Anand also leaves a mark.'Sherni' takes us deep into the forests, through thrilling, tense tiger trails, it also gives also us a dose of some satirical humour."

The evening turns into a hostage situation in which residents and their little daughter, who mistakes the thief for Santa Claus, are pushed to their limits.The film mixes well several genres of drama, dark comedy and satire, and touches many controversial topics of our modern society. The director created an atmosphere of claustrophobia, as the whole story takes place within few hours and in the same place. Actress Natalia Oreiro created a character that is cold, submissive and lifeless, however, the stranger in her house awakens her lost self.The movie has absolutely fantastic soundtrack, music is composed by Pablo Borghi and the score intensifies each scene and creates moments full of tension, wonder or even surrealism.

Just wow.I was lured in on the premise of the movie's title, which turned out to be a ruse. So don't succumb to that very same mistake. While this abysmal movie might actually be based on contents of the original story, don't fall into the pit and get suckered in to watch this atrocity of a movie.The storyline told in this 2021 movie "The Mad Hatter", as written by R. V. Romero and Cate Devaney, was just a travesty. The whole script felt rushed and lacked a proper red thread throughout the course of the movie. And that made for a less than wholesome entertainment experience, let me just tell you that. In fact, the storyline here feels like the two writers sat down apart and wrote segments for the movie without corresponding and then had to piece the segments together afterwards. It was just a scrambled heap of an attempt of making a movie.The acting in the movie was, I suppose, fair enough, given the fact that the actors and actresses had very little to work with in terms of a proper script or interesting characters. Now, the movie has Michael Berryman on the cast list, so that counted for something and that was also one of the reasons why I sat down to watch "The Mad Hatter". But as luck would have it, he wasn't given much screen time, so don't get your hopes up."The Mad Hatter" is listed as a thriller and horror movie. Sure, if you are new to the genre, then you might get some thrills from this movie, or even be mildly scared. But for a horror veteran, such as myself, "The Mad Hatter" was just a swing and a miss.Sure, the production value of the movie was actually good, but that hardly matters when a movie is devoid of a properly entertaining script and storyline, or lacking interesting characters or scary moments.This is by no means a movie that I would recommend you rush out to waste your time, money or effort on. It was a movie that fell short of delivering on all parameters.My rating of "The Mad Hatter" lands on a mere two out of ten stars."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10746060/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","1"," Much worse than it needed to be ","The title of the movie intrigued me: after all, how could a horror movie that looked at the inner workings of The Mad Hatter NOT be fun and scary? Even the Disney version of the Mad Hatter was creepy in his own right. But this movie followed the pattern of The Black Dahlia, using what should have been the main focus of the film as a set piece on which to hang the suggestion of a plot. It was truly an embarrassing effort turned out by people who should know better. Speaking of "people who should know better," I should have known better than to stick around when the professor described the hatter's parties as "drug-fueled orgies."No effort was made to give any dimension to the hatter. At one point, he was described as "the best hatter." At another, it's explained that he may have gone mad because he lost his business. No explanation was given for any of it: did he have innovative designs that somehow went wrong? Did someone die from one of his creations? No one expects a lot of character development in a horror movie, but devoting more than two lines to his life history might have been nice. How about a few facts slipping their way in? The hatter could have gone mad simply BECAUSE he was so successful. The chemicals hatters used to cure hides for their hat-making were, in fact, poisons. Mercury could be considered a cause for his madness. Think about how much better this could have been: the popular and successful hatter invites the wealthy people of the area to his house for a fancy dress ball. A few people in the scene comment about how his behavior has changed and it's good seeing him get "back to normal." Instead of the house getting burned down, he poisons them all and watches them drop, one by one. What he didn't notice that one of the party-goers has given his daughter a poisoned petit four. She dies, too, as he cradles her in his arms. Then, having eaten nothing during his party, he goes into the dining room, props her up in a chair with food on her plate, and sits near her to consume a feast. THEN he intentionally burns the place, to "purify" it.Dang, I might have to write that myself.It would have taken just a few minutes to give the plot a strong premise, one that would have worked so much better. However, it's 2021 and 2021 seems to demand wokeness and debauchery. What a shame."

There ain't anything that will surprise anyone who watch a bit of romcom, so it would be a waste of time to talk about them. However, to my own surprise I actually enjoyed this movie. Only some of the jokes were cringe, and the rest did make me laugh. The cast was decent throughout and there wasn't a particular performance that I hated.I somehow mistaken the main actress, Nina Dobrev, as the beautiful red witch Elizabeth Olsen when I watched the trailer, but I didn't complain because Dobrev is also a quarter.Overall, Thanksgiving is a myth.

I did snicker a bit at certain scenes, but I wish it was funnier to watch when they gave their lines.I will say that the ending was a little cute and heartwarming, but I did want the main characters to have a little more chemistry with each other than the amount we got.I'm going to say that this is at least worth checking out or if you don't like it then I understand, this isn't for everyone."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10752004/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Lack of Chemistry Between the Leads Prevents This From Being a True Hit ","For the most part, the movie is a good one. It's not entirely your typical Christmas movie, although it does borrow a number of overused cliches, there are a few twists to them that aren't typical.Nina Dobrev is supposed to sell us her character and make us believe--in the end--she prefers Josh to Tag. She doesn't succeed. You can see her eyes and chemistry take in Tag while it's forced and completely wooden in regard to Josh. While the end is a nice idea, we're unable to buy it because Dobrev is unable to sell it.Still, the movie's premise is actually a very good one. Many people who suffer from a low self-esteem, or those caught up in a very superficial ideal about what a "perfect mate" is supposed to look like, find themselves invariably thrown a curveball. The person suffering from low self-esteem can never truly believe that they are worthy enough. And the person caught up in an unrealistic ideal will always be disappointed by the outcome. Enter Josh and Natalie, each representing these all-too common aspects.Josh is able to swoon Natalie by creating a real online dating profile with fake photos. Natalie is completely enamored with the whole package, until she realizes that the wrapping isn't what she thought it was.We get a very typical and overused plot line in which--after finding the real Tag--Josh agrees to help her land him. On the other side, Josh asks Natalie to pose as his girlfriend for the sake of his family. Sound familiar? I thought Hallmark had a copyright on these things.As you might easily guess, the "plan" falls apart. However, the way in which the reveal happens as well as the confession, are actually done quite differently from what you might have expected.The performances are very good across the board. What ultimately prevents this move from really working is the lack of chemistry between Dobrev and Yang. Dobrev treats him more like a kid brother than a love interest. We are unable to buy for a second, that her character has any romantic or loving feelings for Yang's character, which unfortunately, makes us not believe in the contrived ending at all.In the end, we get a very wasted effort in which we are given a very bland and vanilla ending to what should have been something far more profound. However, the film's ultimate message about learning to just be yourself, is the true winner here.The movie gets points for its message as well as not using the entire Hallmark playbook that so many Christmas films utilize. It does have some uniqueness to it. It's just so unfortunate that--in the end--the romance is as lacking as a Christmas cookie without any sugar and spice."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10752004/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," A Pleasant Film ","I watched "Love Hard" today and it was just what I was looking for, something light and fun. This film has a nice Christmas vibe and doesn't strain any brain cells, but it is an enjoyable even if predictable ride. Though I didn't like her taking the Baby Jesus statue. Why most films always include such jibes? But other than that nothing offensive. In summary, I give it a 7/10."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10752004/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," A bit to unbelievable in the End ","A mainly Formulaic Rom-Com, right down to the perky Best Friend for the Female Lead. However, it does have enough Twists of its own to make it interesting, like Nina's Karaoke Scene, for example.However, in the end (Spoilers) I just thought that Jimmy Yang and Nina Dobrev are just too far apart to be believable as a Couple, unless they turned him into a Billionaire or something, which they didn't.Watchable enough for me, if nothing better is around, which it is since the other Netflix Movie that premiered, "The Harder They Fall" was an absolute Piece of Crap."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10752004/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Run of the mill, but a great one at that ","Using the backstory of getting catfished, it sets the scene for yet another Christmas feel good romance. Suffice to say, it was nothing special, after the countless Christmas feel good romance that have come out over the years, it isn't much that sets it apart. But what can be seen as a bane is in fact a boon. This trope is a classic, and hey, for a Christmas feel good romance, it still does the trick, giving that flutter in your heart, the dreaminess in your head, and a warmth you feel in your bones, making yourself smile like a fool. Unlike the title, Love Hard, is not a title that is hard to love."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10752004/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Entertaining but lacking in chemistry between the leads... ","It is no Richard Curtis film, but it is entertaining nonetheless. The storyline revolves around Natalie (played by Nina Dobrev), a Los Angeles journalist, whose column chronicles her unlucky dating encounters. When she falls for her dream guy (from Lake Placid, NY) on a dating app, Tag (played by Darren Barnet), she decides to surprise him for the holidays. Things are not as they seem, as she soon finds out that she has been catfished by Josh (played by Jimmy Yang). And so, the romantic comedy begins as we follow Natalie's attempts to find real love. The film is a light-hearted exploration of the pitfalls of online dating and stresses how focusing on the physical misses the point of love (with some digs at the popular Christmas film 'Love Actually'). The writers draw on a popular plot device: deception/mistaken identity. Though in this film, this has multiple layers. There were several funny scenes and good dialogue between Natalie and Josh throughout the film. You will no doubt have a few laughing-out-loud moments as you watch. Indeed, the storyline kept me entertained and engaged throughout. The acting too was very strong. As a fan of the 'Vampire Diaries', I was looking forward to seeing Nina Dobrev on the screen. Her performance did not disappoint. That is, she had a very convincing performance. Jimmy Yang had a decent performance as well (pulling off several funny one-liners). However, one of the weaknesses of the film was the lack of chemistry between the two (Natalie and Josh). Put simply, it was not convincing. As a result, the ending did not land, unfortunately. To be fair, I could feel this develop in Dobrev's performance as the film progressed, but felt no reciprocity here in Yang's performance. He was funny but not very convincing when it came to a romantic connection. Finally, the film had a nice Christmas vibe to it, and the soundtrack was pretty good as well. If you enjoy the romantic comedy Christmas movie genre, then this one is worth checking out."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10752004/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," I've seen worse ","Not a bad Christmas movie, there will be no surprises but also no disappointments. Give it a go for a warm fuzzy feeling if not a little cheesey queesy."

Anyway it was funny, had its moments, no smut just a good honest clean family movie for christmas. It covered different things including sibling jealousy, falling in love out of your ethnic group, learning about families and tradition.Yep it made me laugh in places.

Does it have the traditional Christmas Movie Cliches? Yes, but McG takes those cliches & does something different with them. Throughout the film, I had a big smile on my face. Nina Dobrev & Jimmy O. Yang have fantastic chemistry with each other. Also as an added bonus, I love the spot where Nina Dobrev say that Die Hard is the greatest Christams Movie of All Time, which it is.Overall, Love Hard (2021) is fantastic. I was smiling throughout the 100 minutes of this film. I higlhy recommend that you watch this film, especially if you're a fan of McG."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10752004/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","4"," Potential that missed the mark ","Lovehard is a Christmas movie where Nina Dobrev's character falls in love with an online persona on a dating app after increasing her search range. Later she finds out that she was catfished but the man in the pictures that the catfish was using was also a real person that lives near the catfish. This is where the drama ensues and the movies really takes place. You can mostly guess where the movie will go and it does have all of the typical Christmas ideas thrown into the movie. The only reason I didn't personally like it was that Nina Dobrev's character was just there, not completely likable and the catfish was almost like a placeholder for a better actor to take his place. The chemistry just didn't make it feel like a romance movie. Only a film that was making fun of itself. Nothing else to really bring about in this film, but if you like your cookie cutter Christmas Romance movies, give it a try."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10752004/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Very understated, wholesome and honest Christmas movie. Heartwarmingly recommended. ","I don't usually like Christmas movies, but this one is pretty great. It has something that is lacking in many other movies: Honest feelings, no kitsch, good-hearted humor. It's not a romp and there's no gross-out stuff, just a beautiful romance. The story has been done in numerous ways, but to do something like "Love Hard" deserves merit.Highly recommeded for cuddling into a blanket with hot cocoa."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10752004/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","3"," Eh.. was hoping it'd be better ","Predictable movie. Main character is impossible to root for as they wrote her to be shallow, selfish, and oblivious. If this were compared to a typical Hallmark Christmas movie, I'd say the acting is better but the plot is just as bad. I didn't feel the main characters had any chemistry at all. I would have preferred to see another female play the lead. Lots of cringy elements, such as Die Hard - Baby, it's Cold Outside - theme from The Breakfast Club. The writers just plucked out common pieces of pop culture to assign the main character a personality... and it was awful. Best part of the movie was probably the Lin family or Kerry. There were some enjoyable moments in the movie, but doubt I'll watch it again."

Lot of things going in the story were difficult to believe, so even after watching the pain you don't quite get connected. Few sequences stretched unnecessarily. I feel that concentrating on one problem and it's solution would have made the film more engrossing to watch rather than creating multiple problems to make it look miserable. Apart from decent acting, there is no factor that you would like to remember. Unless you are not looking for something special, you can watch it once. Especially the way Shweta played a girl having squint problem."

Yet as much as we love it when a plan comes together, we also seem to love a movie where things fall apart. And the Hyenas have found themselves stranded in the Sine-Saloum Delta, a group of isolated islands filled with local legends and dark magic. Now, the police -- and maybe much worse things -- are coming down on them.The Hyenas -- Chaka (Yann Gael), Rafa (Roger Sallah) and Minuit (Mentor Ba) -- have survived so many wars and missions thanks to their skill and trust in one another. But this time feels different. That's because it seems like Chaka, their leader, is hiding something. And as they stay within a small lodging camp until they can figure out their escape, the mute Awa (Evelyne Ily Juhen) threatens to expose them to the police unless she can go on the run with them.Yet by the end, this movie goes from Italian western to American action to a supernatural take on Predator.

They made an agreement with the human authorities. They agree not to kill and drink from only those who consent. They have become rich and powerful while living the high life during the nights. Benny (Jorge Lendeborg Jr.) is reckless teen. His brother recruits him to take over his driving job for the night. He has sexy Blaire (Debby Ryan) and Zoe (Lucy Fry) as his clients. They are making several stops and intends to finish before sunrise. He has no idea that they are vampires.This movie tries to be cool like a nightclub that you can't get into. The funny thing about those nightclubs is that they look trashy in the full light of day. This movie tries to be another cool nightclub but closer examination leaves it wanting. First, I don't like Benny. He's a stereotypical bratty teen. It would work better for him to be roped into the job. He would gain more rooting interest if he's less brash. As for this world building, it's haphazard and half done. Apparently, there is vast conspiracy and nobody outside of it knows anything about it. The plot is a bit thin. This movie is a bit thin."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10763820/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Take a bite ","Morally speaking you may have some issues with the movie. It does also not warrant for you to overthink the whole concept or certain actions or think things true (like the concept and construct of the world portrayed here). So in other words: do cut this some slack please - for your own sake.If you do that and don't have issues with a little (or a lot of) blood ... go ahead and watch this. It sort of treats both genders almost equally. Well if you can attest genders to vampires that is. And also it may more be the expectations of the viewers. I'd say there is a lot of respect for the viewers - which is quite a good thing.Very good cinematography and what a pool of actors involved. Even in smaller roles it's like ... I know him/her. Well at least that is true with me. Fast paced, after a bit of a slow start with quite a lot of exposition, the movie takes off and never stops ... and certainly does not take prisoners ... well maybe literally speaking. The cliches are hidden well and the movie works quite fine - again suspension of disbelief necessary as stated above."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10763820/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","2"," But everything was essentially just pointless... ","Wow, this movie was a swing and a miss. Now, vampire movies are sort of a mixed lot for me, but I opted to watch the 2021 Netflix movie "Night Teeth" on the odd chance that it might be an appealing and entertaining one.But as it turned out, then "Night Teeth" from writer Brent Dillon and director Adam Randall was not a movie that had much of any appeal to me whatsoever. There was just so very little worthwhile sinking your teeth into here.First of all, the storyline was insanely slow paced and devoid of anything interesting or exciting, so I gave up on the movie not even halfway through. Yeah, the movie was that boring for me, so I didn't even bother with sticking around to watch more of that pointless nonsense that was supposed to be a storyline.The character gallery in "Night Teeth" was every bit as devoid of anything interesting as the storyline was. So writer Brent Dillon didn't score any points here either. I am sure that the actors and actresses that participated in this Netflix movie were doing good jobs, but they just had nothing to work with in terms of script and characters."Night Teeth" failed entirely to entertain me, and this was a vampire movie that just lacked a bite.My rating of "Night Teeth" lands on a generous two out of ten stars, and that is mostly based on the production value alone. If you enjoy a good vampire movie, you might want to skip on this stinker."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10763820/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Aimless sexiness ","Night teeth oozed with sexiness, which is always appreciated in Vampire Noir. However, when taking a deep dive into the plot, it was a bit aimless and lacked depth. Almost like arriving at a game already in progress and leaving before it finishes."

Their chauffour of the limo they hired had been skipped with a younger and inexperienced driver without iron ion ores as they urge for, and completely estranged in such a high level of social clubbing, and for him it all becomes a fight to survive to see next mornings daylight...its a hip hop scored movie, far better than id expected, acting are sincere and cruel, and except from not driving a deville, they love to blow the horns and neckkisses and fanging bullets with the tip of a tounge. Calm down ...its not a roadtrip movie, it stays at boleyn heights close to the skid row, and theodore roosevelt high so some familiar places you will find.Its neatly filmed, special effect qualifies, some small glitches on the editing, for the rest its fine. So if your in for a night with vlads cousines, then be my guest. Its a better film than much made of the genre over the last 10 years thinks the grumpy old man."

The music is excellent, mystery is quite intriguing, cinematography is great and the entertainment value is pretty solid. I'm glad I decided to watch this vampire thrill ride!"

",""Night Teeth" is a Crime - Drama movie in which we watch a chauffeur picks up two mysterious women and soon figures out that they are not common women. He will find himself between some unbelievable truths about the world he lives in and he will have to fight for his life too.I did not have high expectations from this movie so, I was not disappointed by it. The plot was simple and there were some plot holes that were not explained. The interpretations of Jorge Lendeborg Jr. Who played as Benny, Lucy Fry who played as Zoe and Debby Ryan who played as Blaire were good but not good enough to save the movie. Since Alfie Allen (Victor) and Megan Fox (Grace) did not have much time in the movie there are not many things I can tell about them. To sum up, I have to say that "Night Teeth" is an average vampire movie to spend your time with if you have not any other movie to watch, do not have any expectations by it otherwise you will be disappointed."

Now a rogue vampire Victor and his minions have broken that pact, slaying humans and the vampire lords. We see nightclubs where humans are strapped to tables, eager to be vampire groupies and give blood, suddenly their throats are torn out by Blaire (Debby Ryan) and Zoe (Lucy Fry). This dastardly duo proceed from club to club slaying the vampire leaders, they have hired Benny (Jorge Lendebourge Jr.) as their chauffeur, thinking he is his brother Jay (Raul Castillo) a human aware of the pact. Benny behaves like his namesake from Crossroads at first but his character develops as the plot unfolds. Vampire enforcers also get involved, clashing with the rogue vampires. Quite gory at times with the biting stabbing and crossbows; Victor literally has human prisoners on tap for blood. Most of the narrative proceeds relatively predictably but there are a few pleasant and disturbing plot turns. Good bloodsucking action and fun. Directed by Adam Randall, written by Brent Dillon. On Netflix. 7/10."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10763820/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," Wonderful ","Wonderful film of its kind, suitable for everyone and very entertaining. This film is to be seen without too many expectations because it is a light and well done film that does very well what it was created for. One thing this film excels in is making you feel the discomfort of the protagonist throughout the initial part and also manages to make the sexual tension between the protagonist and the vampire shine through well but perhaps too much."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10763820/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," Sucking blood ","First I want to say that I like Vampires, meaning it sucks when Vampires are not portrayed correctly like how badly the Twilight movie series shows them. When they are portrayed right I enjoy the movie more.Night Teeth sounded promising when I read the plot, so I went on Netflix to check it out, now I have some things to say about it.I do like the acting of the main character and the 2 Vampires, it feels like effort was put into this which was nice seeing the time they spent on it was not put to waste.I actually did like the stuff Vampires do in this like sucking blood and fast healing, even keeping the simple weaknesses like the sun burning them. I like that they portrayed these Vampires as crime causing creatures that cause trouble.I liked the world they kind of set up and how there are certain rules in the truce between humans and Vampires, but there are some things that were small issues.The main evil Vampires or Vampire was a little over the top and I didn't feel like it fitted the situation of what was going on, also it can be slow at certain times but it wasn't that big a deal.This isn't a great movie but its not an awful movie, I think you should at least watch it because at least it got the idea of what Vampires are. I got to give it credit for that."

This was one of those 'middle of the road' vampire films...I had my likes and dislikes. With a cast of former Disney or tean movie franchise stars, this felt more like Mean Girls than Lost Boys. I liked the fights a lot, but was dissappointed with the lack of gore and you want blood in a vampire film. The crappy story finalized things for me with it's predictable model. This is an ok watch, but keep your expectations low."

We get it already - vampire movies make money but that doesn't mean the industry gotta stop trying to make a good film. A bunch of people standing around looking like they are over everything with a bad attitude does not a good movie make.Having Megan Fox in this for 5 minutes tops just to get people to come to this is lame. Lucy Fry is just plain annoying AF throughout the whole film. The lead guy is not Hollywood material. They needed to clean him up more. He looked like a scuzzy drug dealer. When he had kissing scenes I wanted to throw up.The story doesn't really delve into much backstory. It just shows two girls driving around killing people in clubs. Lame storyline and lame characters.Nothing here to see...I guess you could say this movie sucks...but not in a good way."

This was stylised by The Blade Trilogy.It is not a bad way to spend 1 hour & 48 minutes of your time. It fortunately does not emulate the emo Twilight Saga & presents something that is decent enough for viewing. It is no Blade, From Dust to Dawn, but very few films are!"

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10763820/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Huge potential not fully achieved, yet fun to watch ! ","I was waiting a lot for this movie ever since i saw the first trailer. Its basically some of my favorite things mixed up, like vampires, love story, night of crazy things happening, it had all the ingredient for me to enjoy. Ultimately i did, but not as much as i wish i would have.The story between the 3 main characters is overall well developed, and it made a lot of sense what happens between them, but this come at the price of a lot of dialogue and parts of the movies where not much happen outside of that. The movie could had expend its mythology a lot more too and explain a few things like for instance why the 2 ladies are that strong compare to other vamps, or why Victor has the same tatoo as Benny's brother Jay. They definately seem to have a past together but its not really explained? Was Victor a former Vampire hunter? Or i totally missed it. Somehow i feel a series could had been better with this material at expending instead of a movie.I enjoyed the cameos of the more known actors altough ill admit Megan Fox as a vampire is something i wished lasted more than a few minutes.Ultimately its kind of weird, i enjoyed it, but i think i had set my expectations too high in the first place like it would be the ultimate vampire movie of the decade for me while it was just "a fun time". But its definately worth a watch. I also hope they make a sequel."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10763820/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","5"," Nothing special ","It started out ok but about halfway in it got a little boring. Some of long drawn out meaningless dialouge between Benny and Blaire almost put me to sleep. I wouldn't say it's the worst vampire movie out there and its definitely not the best.

But I understand it is hard to make new facts from old vampire movies . With the exception of Daybreakers. This one was good to pass the time with and I recommend if you enjoy vampire movie. I would have watch it just to see Debby Ryan's side grin. Everyone was eye candy in this movie, except Victor, just not my type."

This one was actually pretty good comparing to the other dreck on there. It was predictable that's why I couldn't give it a nine. It really a 5, but since I'm just judging this on Netflix made movies, I'll add 3 extra stars. Nothing is thrown in your face for political reasons."

Except, nothing was funny or even remotely cute, there was no horror, most of the action scenes were off-camera and have not seen a protagonist so unlikeable since Tiger King. The main characters over-acted his part of playing stupid and nave to the point of unwatchable. The plot which could have been simple enough was complicated by a completely unnecessary romance that caused the film to grind to a halt whenever there was dialogue. Also...you never fully know what is going on.Anyone over the age of 18(rephrase, anyone whose mental age is actually over 18) should take a pass."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10763820/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," Vampires, glamour, LA, sexy ladies, and great parties in an okay movie ","A movie containing vampires, mansion parties with the rich in LA, two sexy girls on a rampage and also having Theon Greyjoy and the wonderful Megan Fox is of course a good watch no matter how bad the movie is in actuality.The negatives are few but notable. The main idea of Jay selling out his little brother to drive around vampires feels off and weird. That one of the ladies like the driver is okay, but not written good enough. A few further script misses also messes with the story. The worst though is that this movie do not really know what it want to be. Horror? Comedy? Vampire thriller? Action drama noir? The movie switches too often and have no clear direction and no clear goal which is what mainly reduce the score and the general feel of the movie. If this would have taken a more comedic road, or taken a more grim slasher road it would likely have made the movie better.The good stuff overweighs though with a great music score, high production value, great performances (all actors are great), and a decent story. Cinematography and directing is great. Although the "love" story between one vampire lady and the driver Benny is convoluted and off, it is still kinda fun. This could easily been cringe and cliche, and it sort of is but enough of the movie feel fresh and fun to make it decently enjoyable.I gave this a 6/10 which I think the movie deserves. The potential is higher, but sadly they did not nail it and the script is not great enough. As I said above they should have been clearer with intent, goal and script to really make this into a great movie or at least they could have made this into a classic. Also, as a final note, this could probably be a good game to play... or why not make this into a TV show? Been a while since we had a good vampire show playing out in Los Angeles."

I started watching Gintama series in late 2018 and I've watched many other renowned animes before and after it, but Gintama still stands on the top of my favourites. This movie is probably the second one watching which I shed my tears. The way of presenting the emotions and the relationship between friends, allies and between a teacher and his students is just epic. Hats off to studio Sunrise and a massive thanks to Hideaki Sorachi for gifting a masterpiece in form of Gintama."

","I always have reservations when a new Mod film is released, they always try to be the next Quadrophenia and fail miserably! Pleased to say, this is not one of those films and I loved it!Set in today's times with a simple feel good plot, this film has all the makings of being a true British Classic!From start to finish the loveable characters take you on a heartwarming emotion journey to Brighton.Watch out for these great new young actors, they should go far!Finally it was great to see the lovely Jesse Birdsall (an old crush from 'The Fear' & 'Eldorado' days).

It failed as a road movie, just not enough road shots and those that were there were clearly at about 5 mph in a park, too many convenient coincidences eased their path. The premise was fine, but too many angst ridden teenager shots. The final denouement was painful and, frankly, a bit cruel.The Kensit attempted seduction thing. Dearie me.Nice music, but not enough made of it. Sorry, not for me."

","A superb, honest and well put together small budget film which punches heavily above its financial weight.The thing I like most about the film is its use of the mod culture is used to 'dress' the story of the film. Its done with just the right amount of respect and honesty, not over the top at all. Its perhaps a testament to the strength of the script and the performances of the actors that this happens.I think anyone involved in mod culture and scootering will love this film but more so it's just a superb feel good road movie story of a young man, as he's grows up through learning about his fathers past and the characters he encounters along the way.Some great photography, a really thoughout storyline with some genuinely moving and at times very funny parts send this film on its way into your heart."

If you are into the mod culture or not, you will love the characters in this film, especially Sacha Parkinson who shines in every scene she is in.It is hard to believe that this is a micro-budget film due to the excellent cast and superb cinematography that has you immersed in the story of the boy coming to terms with the passing of his father.A feel-good road trip with an excellent soundtrack will have Paul Weller and The Jam fans smiling from ear to ear!Go and see this on the big screen whilst you have the chance, you will remember it for a long time."

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10773626/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," Light, funny and heartwarming ","I really enjoyed this. It's a light, coming of age tale which invokes distant memories of Quadrophenia but only by association. The crux of the tale is a road trip undertaken by John to scatter his father's ashes at Brighton beach. He is aided by the feisty Nicki, brilliantly portrayed by Sacha Parkinson who adds some real class and comic timing to the proceedings. Jessie Birdsall also has a pivotal and poignant cameo. The music isn't as prominent as I would've liked but the story and the little mysteries uncovered along the way made for an enjoyable movie."

Not edgy, violent or trying to tick boxes.

","I'm not a mod but I do like the music that is associated with mod culture so I decided to give this film a go. I wasn't disappointed. After a slow start it began to flow when Nicki (Sacha Parkinson) and John (Patrick McNamee) hit the road on their scooters. There are a few laugh out loud moments as the storyline begins to unfold.Once they get to Brighton you can almost smell the sea air and it's easy to be swept away with the mod experience that Brighton emulates. The lead characters are likable and work well together and it was nice to see some well known faces making appearances along the way.All in all it's a feel good romcom, easy on the eye and music to my ears. Well done to all involved, it can't be easy making a low budget film look polished but you managed to pull it off!!"

"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10787484/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","6"," "Whitetail" (2021): Like father, like son? ","Evil has infected a vast and forested remote Texas ranch. Into this crucible enter a father, son and uncle.What follows is terrifying.Thus is the sinister and multi-layered parable presented us in the new domestic crime thriller "Whitetail".I spoke with writer/director Derek Presley.Q: Having grown up in, and lived and traveled throughout, Texas, it is of particular personal interest that "Whitetail" is shot in the north central region of the state. How did this unique choice of location come to be?A: There's a couple of different reasons why. Mostly, it's because the story originated from my past when I'd go hunting at my family's farm out near Coleman, Texas. The farm was this really flat and dusty stretch of property. I believe it was a few hundred acres, but I was younger so it may as well have been thousands to me. I wanted to shoot the film at the exact location but my family sold the property a few years back. So Austin Williams (producer/upm) had this perfect piece of land that he'd actually shot a few films on. The land was very similar to what I wrote about and off we went. The other reason was that the core group of filmmakers consisting of Jason Starne, Garrett Schwindt and Austin Williams, all lived within an hour or so and we could get to it much easier than what I had originally planned.Q: Masculinity, and the ofttimes fragility of such, is investigated on a number of levels in this story. Share your thoughts on this prominent and complex theme running through "Whitetail".A: Well, it's really the nucleus of the whole film. There were two characters in the film that were entirely based on one person in my life from my past. That person quite literally had two different personalities and both of them, while vastly contrasting, were overly masculine. I think there's so much of it going on in the story where there's only men doing men things and behaving like children. The only one with any sense is the one person who has yet to reach real "manhood". My cinematographer/producer, Garrett Schwindt, told me he believed the whole film was a moral cautionary tale about toxic masculinity. I think he's right.Q: As a Christian, it is especially heartening to see the faith, and, more specifically, The Bible, being presented with both dignity and thoughtfulness. I watch and review a lot of movies. This is enormously rare in the secular film industry. Your thoughts?A: That's interesting that you've seen it that way. Some people have said it's a secular story and some have thought it was non-secular. There's no direct message from me to anyone about religion in the film. What that was, was to show how this man wouldn't back down and wouldn't give up on seeing the good in someone, even if it didn't turn out the best for him. But at the same time, it was also a way to show that there is pure evil in this world and evil can do a lot of damage, despite the good.Q: One interpretation of the final moments of "Whitetail" is that we are bearing witness to a "right of passage" between father and son. It is a most uncommon legacy, one that involves unflinching focus and the will to claim life. As both writer and director of the film, does this approach the intent of enduring impression?A: Partially, absolutely. Hunting is something that is almost ritualistic in deep Texas. Father and son go and bond that way. Not everyone enjoys it. I most certainly won't take my son hunting to bond. Not because I think one way or another about the act of it, but mostly because I just don't find it appealing. There's a bit about innocence because Donnie can't bring himself to take the animal's life and at the end that's all he's really thinking his father would be mad at him about. So that "rite of passage" was kind of never executed, at least on the surface.I'd say more than anything it's about the innocence of the son and the guilt of the father. Innocence prevailed...kind of....Q: Where does your creative muse take you and your audience next, Derek?A: RED STONE is the film we shot after WHITETAIL. Production was in June of 2020, pretty much right after people were coming out of lockdown from Covid. That is a southern crime thriller taking place over the course of one day in a small Texas town. BOON was shot this past January in Washington state up in the mountains and it's a Neo-Western filled with snow and the bitter cold."Whitetail" opens in select theaters on July 21, and becomes available on home entertainment this fall."

Nothing happens the first hour. Is it Tom ? Tom? The suspenseful music is suppose to add drama to a drama less movie. Dumbest movie ever made. Period ! You boys got yourself into a pickle ???? Who writes this garbage ?"
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10787484/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Dark but good ","This movie was extremely dark and made you think. Filled with intense moments but was paced well. The actors did great and the story was interesting. I was annoyed with the ending because it didn't go where I thought it would, but it I guess that it was still good.Really crazy characters."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10787484/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," Strong indie ","I caught this when it screened in Dallas this month. I looked for it again but couldn't find it playing anywhere else. I hope it does becaue I recommended it to a few friends I know would love it.It won't be everyone's cup of tea, because it's pretty intense and dark. But man, it's a ride. I would say it was a tad long, but again it never really got slow. The actors were locals and were really really good!Catch this if you can."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10787484/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Bleak as heck ","Bleak as heck film I saw at Texas tHeater when it showed. This is the type of film that makes you think. I got to hear the producers talk about it for a few minutes afterwards and they seemed like they were really passionate about it. The camera and acting was great. I was surprised because I don't know any of the actors but holy s**t they were good!Some people will not like it and some will love it. Not sure if I'll ever watch it again because it really was bleak but it's a good film. But i was interested the whole time and there were some really intense and scary scenes."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10787484/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","8"," Loved it ","Didn't expect to like this as much as we did. I caught the trailer for it while we saw a film last week.I love films like Blue Ruin and this reminded me of it.Very well done. Slow burn thriller that is full of tense moments. Beautiful looking and the performances were strong. Again, very surprised to like this. Good thriller that reminded me of the old films that took their time telling the story.Thumbs up."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10787484/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","7"," Surprisingly good. ","I watched this because I saw Paul T. Taylor was in it. I grew up a Hellraiser fan and while I didn't like it, I loved his take on Pinhead.So I was fortunate enough to see this early and I have to say...I was honestly surprised how good it was.It comes off like a masculine survival film but it's actually way deeper than that. The characters are well developed. The story is traditional (finding bag of money and getting chased by bad guys) but it's always moving forward and entertaining.While there is a ton of dialogue and sometimes it bogs down the flow, it's still really well done and the actors are great.Pinhead (Paul Taylor) is awesome and not what I thought he would be.Overall good film and surprised it wasn't in some festivals..."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10787484/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","9"," Southern Gothic Done Right... ","Whitetail knows exactly what it is, namely a Southern Gothic thriller with a minimalist approach to its themes. It's not a "feel good" movie, nor does it pretend to be. It's reminiscent of a Cormac McCarthy novel with a side of Deliverance (other films such as Frailty and A Simple Plan come to mind). If you're looking for a traditional good versus evil film with a large budget, then don't bother. If, however, you're looking for a pessimistic yet strangely cathartic story about the possibility of redemption, then you'll most likely enjoy Whitetail. I personally did. If you "get it," then it's an easy four stars out of five. Any rating below that tells me the viewer probably watched it with a very different set of expectations that didn't align with what the movie itself sought to achieve in the first place.Speaking as someone who appreciates the Southern Gothic genre as a whole, I hope Derek Presley (the writer and director) continues to use it as a model for future films."
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10787484/reviews/?ref_=adv_li_tt","10"," Derek Presley does it again! ","I've been a huge fan of Derek Presley's film for years. I'm glad he is starting to get the recognition he deserves. This movie has his style all over it. The movie is beautiful. It combines the calming Texas landscape with a truly unnerving story. Every actor brings their unique and flawed character to life. This not only keeps you guessing about who will come out on top, but also who to root for. You will be doing yourself a disservice if you miss this movie!"
